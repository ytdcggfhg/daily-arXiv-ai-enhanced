### [1] [LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge: automating error analysis in natural language generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09147)
*Nadezhda Chirkova,Tunde Oluwaseyi Ajayi,Seth Aycock,Zain Muhammad Mujahid,Vladana Perlić,Ekaterina Borisova,Markarit Vartampetian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的定性评估方法（LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge），旨在为自然语言生成（NLG）系统提供结构化的改进报告，而非仅依赖数值评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估工具主要用于定量分析（如数值评分），但缺乏对具体问题的定性反馈。本文旨在填补这一空白，帮助开发者更直观地理解NLG系统的改进方向。

Method: 方法包括两步：1）对每个实例进行开放式问题分析；2）通过直观累积算法对发现的问题进行聚类。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在2/3的情况下能正确识别实例特定问题，并能生成与人工标注相似的问题类型报告。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge为NLG系统提供了有效的定性评估工具，帮助开发者优化系统性能。

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

### [2] [PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09175)
*Peidong Wang,Jian Xue,Rui Zhao,Junkun Chen,Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian,Jinyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语词典偏置的方法，用于提升语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性，并在流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练数据中短语出现频率低，语音翻译任务中短语的正确翻译具有挑战性。

Method: 提出短语词典偏置方法，利用源语言到目标语言的短语映射对，应用于流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型。

Result: 短语词典偏置方法在流式语音翻译模型中相对短语列表偏置方法提升了21%，并在多模态大语言模型中实现了85%的相对短语召回率提升。

Conclusion: 短语词典偏置方法显著提升了语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性，并能有效利用外部短语信息。

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list
biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In
addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to
use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase
recall.

### [3] [A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218)
*Bruno Ferenc Šegedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式卷积神经网络（CNN）在原始音频波形上的词汇不变泛化能力，并提出了一种新的方法，通过绕过全连接层（FC）输入随机特征图来探测模型的词汇独立泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度神经网络（DNNs）是否能表示从词汇学习中衍生的音位学泛化能力，以及缩小全连接层瓶颈对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 训练生成式CNN模型，缩小全连接层瓶颈至8通道，并通过绕过FC输入随机特征图生成音频输出。

Result: 卷积层能够动态泛化超出FC学习的词汇约束配置的音位依赖关系。

Conclusion: 卷积层具备词汇独立的泛化能力，为研究音位学泛化提供了新方法。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

### [4] [Extrapolation by Association: Length Generalization Transfer in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09251)
*Ziyang Cai,Nayoung Lee,Avi Schwarzschild,Samet Oymak,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer模型可以通过任务关联实现长度泛化的转移，即通过训练相关任务使模型能够泛化到未见过的更长输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型如何通过任务关联实现长度泛化，以理解其泛化能力的来源。

Method: 通过在不同算法任务（如算术运算、字符串变换和迷宫导航）上训练模型，研究长度泛化的转移现象。

Result: 模型可以从相关任务中继承泛化能力，预训练语言模型也表现出类似的转移效果。注意力头的重用与泛化转移相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer模型如何通过任务间的组合性重用实现泛化，加深了对模型泛化机制的理解。

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

### [5] [Self-Anchored Attention Model for Sample-Efficient Classification of Prosocial Text Chat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09259)
*Zhuofang Li,Rafal Kocielnik,Fereshteh Soltani,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的自锚注意力模型（SAAM），用于识别和分类游戏聊天中的亲社会行为，相比现有技术提升了7.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测游戏聊天中的负面内容，但亲社会行为同样重要，却缺乏相关数据集和模型。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用无监督发现与游戏领域专家合作，提出SAAM模型，利用整个训练集作为“锚点”提升低资源环境下的模型性能。

Result: SAAM模型在《使命召唤：现代战争II》中验证有效，成为首个自动化分类游戏聊天亲社会行为的系统。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线平台提供了从惩罚负面行为到鼓励积极互动的转变工具，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

### [6] [Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277)
*Milan Bhan,Jean-Noel Vittaut,Nicolas Chesneau,Sarath Chandar,Marie-Jeanne Lesot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，通过比较LLM生成的自我自然语言解释（self-NLE）与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量衡量其忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖行为测试或计算块识别，未能深入模型推理的神经活动，导致无法准确评估self-NLE的忠实性。

Method: 引入一种灵活框架，直接比较self-NLE与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量衡量忠实性。

Result: 该框架提供了对self-NLE忠实性的深入理解，并为生成更忠实的self-NLE奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了对self-NLE忠实性的理解，并为未来生成更忠实解释提供了工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

### [7] [$(RSA)^2$: A Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware Rational Speech Act Framework for Figurative Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09301)
*Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano,David Austin,Pablo Piantanida,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware RSA框架（$(RSA)^2$），用于解释比喻性语言（如反讽、夸张等），无需建模说话者的动机，结合LLMs在反讽解释任务中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比喻性语言在人类交流中普遍存在，但现有RSA框架无法解释或需特定建模说话者动机。

Method: 引入$(RSA)^2$框架，通过考虑说话者的修辞策略来建模比喻性语言。

Result: $(RSA)^2$无需建模说话者动机即可实现人类兼容的解释，结合LLMs在PragMega+数据集的反讽任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: $(RSA)^2$为比喻性语言提供了一种更通用的解释方法，展示了在自然语言处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

### [8] [Alzheimer's Dementia Detection Using Perplexity from Paired Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09315)
*Yao Xiao,Heidi Christensen,Stefan Goetze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Mistral-7B大语言模型的配对困惑度方法，用于检测阿尔茨海默病（AD），相比现有方法显著提高了准确性，并展示了其可解释性和潜在应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）常伴随语言能力下降，现有检测方法的准确性和可解释性不足。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B大语言模型扩展配对困惑度方法，并通过提示微调模型以学习AD患者的语言模式。

Result: 新方法比现有最佳配对困惑度方法平均提高3.33%的准确性，比ADReSS 2020基准方法提高6.35%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了AD检测的准确性，还展示了可解释性和潜在的数据增强与模型解释新途径。

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

### [9] [Towards Efficient and Effective Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09329)
*Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了改进大语言模型（LLM）对齐的新方法，包括数据收集、训练和评估的创新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多样任务中表现优异，但与人类期望的高效对齐仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出Lion框架优化数据收集，WebR自动生成指令数据；开发LTE和BMC改进训练；引入FollowBench评估对齐效果。

Result: Lion和WebR显著提升数据多样性和可扩展性；LTE和BMC优化知识更新和偏好对齐；FollowBench揭示模型在约束遵循上的不足。

Conclusion: 论文通过创新方法在LLM对齐的多个环节取得进展，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备心智理论能力，通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架测试其协作与意图推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs是否能推断他人意图，对促进人机协作及多智能体系统的合作至关重要。

Method: 利用基于LLM的智能体在MARL环境中进行自然语言交互，测试其协作与意图推理能力。

Result: 研究旨在提升AI智能体与人类及AI伙伴的协作能力，推动混合人机系统的发展。

Conclusion: LLMs在协作任务中展现潜力，为未来人机交互提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

*Siheng Li,Zhanhui Zhou,Wai Lam,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePO通过利用多样化的回放策略从回放缓冲区中检索离策略样本，提升了数据效率和计算效率，相比GRPO在多个数学推理基准测试中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO方法因使用多个同策略输出来估计优势，导致计算成本高且数据效率低。

Method: 提出RePO方法，利用回放缓冲区中的离策略样本进行策略优化，增加样本多样性。

Result: 在五个LLM和七个数学推理基准测试中，RePO显著优于GRPO，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: RePO在提升计算效率和性能方面具有显著优势，适用于大规模语言模型的优化。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository

### [12] [Latent Multi-Head Attention for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09342)
*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究首次全面探讨了小型语言模型中潜在多头注意力（MLA）的效率与质量权衡，发现MLA+RoPE在减少内存消耗的同时几乎不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小型语言模型中潜在多头注意力的效率与质量权衡，为内存受限的应用场景提供优化方案。

Method: 训练30M参数的GPT模型，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA及MLA+RoPE三种架构变体，重点关注内存和性能表现。

Result: MLA+RoPE在减少45% KV缓存内存的同时，验证损失仅增加0.3%，且推理速度提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: MLA+RoPE是内存受限部署的帕累托改进方案，RoPE对小型模型的MLA性能至关重要。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

*Yuchen Feng,Bowen Shen,Naibin Gu,Jiaxuan Zhao,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVE是一种多样性增强的重构方法，通过修剪和重组FFN模块，高效地训练MoE LLMs，减少训练开销并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重构方法忽视专家多样性，导致冗余。DIVE利用修剪后的LLM在不同校准数据集上的多样性，提出更高效的重构方案。

Method: DIVE包括领域亲和性挖掘、基于修剪的专家重构和高效再训练。具体步骤为修剪和重组FFN模块，再训练路由、专家和归一化模块。

Result: DIVE在相同激活参数数量下，优于现有修剪和MoE重构方法，实现了训练效率与准确性的平衡。

Conclusion: DIVE通过多样性增强的重构方法，显著降低了MoE LLMs的训练成本，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

Method: 通过分析SQL等价和不等价的常见模式，并讨论基于LLM评估的挑战。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在评估语义等价性方面具有潜力，但也面临实际应用中的困难。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于评估SQL语义等价性，但需进一步解决实际挑战。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
Text-to-SQL (NL2SQL) systems, yet evaluating the semantic equivalence of
generated SQL remains a challenge, especially given ambiguous user queries and
multiple valid SQL interpretations. This paper explores using LLMs to assess
both semantic and a more practical "weak" semantic equivalence. We analyze
common patterns of SQL equivalence and inequivalence, discuss challenges in
LLM-based evaluation.

*Zhengyuan Liu,Stella Xin Yin,Dion Hoe-Lian Goh,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COGENT是一个面向课程的框架，用于生成适合年级的教育内容，解决了生成式AI在教育中的挑战，如课程对齐和阅读水平控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的应用存在课程标准对齐和阅读水平控制的问题，尤其是在STEM教育中。

Method: COGENT结合了科学概念、核心思想和学习目标，通过长度、词汇和句子复杂度控制可读性，并采用“基于好奇”的方法提高学生兴趣。

Result: 实验表明，COGENT生成的文本在适合年级方面优于或与人工参考相当。

Conclusion: COGENT为扩展自适应和高质量学习资源提供了可行方法。

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoLMbo是一种新型的说话人语言模型（SLM），通过结合说话人编码器和提示条件，生成详细的说话人特征描述，解决了传统说话人识别系统在提取结构化人口统计属性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人识别系统仅限于分类任务，难以生成详细的说话人特征或上下文丰富的描述，无法结构化捕捉方言、性别和年龄等人口统计属性。

Method: CoLMbo整合说话人编码器与提示条件，利用用户定义的提示动态适应新说话人特征，生成包括方言变体和年龄特征在内的定制描述。

Result: CoLMbo不仅提升了传统说话人分析能力，还在零样本场景中表现出色，标志着说话人识别领域的重大进展。

Conclusion: CoLMbo通过创新方法解决了传统系统的局限性，为说话人识别提供了更丰富、更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related
traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker
profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,
marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何自动区分低质量与高质量新闻标题/链接，评估了12种机器学习模型，发现传统集成方法和深度学习模型均有效，但存在性能与训练时间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻的泛滥导致低质量新闻标题/链接广泛传播，研究旨在自动区分其质量。

Method: 使用包含57,544,214条新闻标题/链接的数据集，提取115个语言特征，评估了12种机器学习模型，包括传统集成方法和深度学习模型（如DistilBERT）。

Result: 传统集成方法（如bagging分类器）表现良好（88.1%准确率），而微调的DistilBERT达到最高准确率（90.3%）。

Conclusion: NLP特征结合传统分类器或深度学习模型均可有效区分新闻质量，但需权衡预测性能与训练时间。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在礼貌语言使用上与人类存在差异，虽能复制部分语用学策略，但过度依赖负面礼貌策略可能导致误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能在礼貌语言上实现与人类相似的语境敏感性，以平衡信息性和社交目标。

Method: 通过比较人类和LLM在约束性和开放性任务中的回答，分析其礼貌策略的使用。

Result: 大模型（≥70B参数）能复制语用学偏好，人类评价者更偏好LLM的回答，但LLM过度依赖负面礼貌策略。

Conclusion: LLMs在礼貌策略上表现优异，但细微差异引发了对AI系统语用对齐的质疑。

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识树的知识追踪框架（KT$^2$），用于在低资源条件下提升学生知识状态估计和表现预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实课堂中的知识追踪通常面临数据稀缺和需要在线更新的挑战，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 利用层次化知识概念信息，提出基于隐马尔可夫树模型的KT$^2$框架，通过EM算法估计学生掌握程度，并支持增量更新。

Result: 实验表明，KT$^2$在低资源在线设置中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KT$^2$通过结合层次化知识概念和增量更新机制，有效解决了低资源条件下的知识追踪问题。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在多选题问答(MCQA)任务中表现优异，但对输入扰动非常敏感。为提高模型在噪声环境中的鲁棒性，作者提出了TCD方法。

Method: 提出Token Constraint Decoding (TCD)算法，通过约束令牌级预测的一致性来增强模型鲁棒性。结合提示工程(PE)进一步优化性能。

Result: 在CommonsenseQA、MMLU和MMLU-Pro等数据集上的实验表明，TCD显著提升了模型在噪声输入下的性能，尤其对较弱模型如Gemma3 1B，性能提升高达39%。

Conclusion: TCD是一种实用且模型无关的方法，能够显著提升LLMs在噪声环境中的推理稳定性，为安全关键或用户导向应用的可靠部署提供了可能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决KGQA中数据稀缺和多跳推理样本不足的问题，传统方法在单跳问题和语义失真上表现有限。

Method: 采用提示设计范式，利用大语言模型生成大规模（问题，逻辑形式）对，结合单跳伪问题生成、语义保留改写和答案引导的反向路径探索。

Result: 在WebQSP和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上，F1、Hits@1和准确率分别提升2.8%、1.2%、3.1%和1.8%、1.1%、2.4%。

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA通过数据增强和语义解析流水线显著提升了KGQA的性能，尤其在多跳推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 在数字化时代，欺骗检测是一项关键且具有挑战性的任务，研究旨在评估LLMs和LMMs在此任务中的表现。

Method: 研究使用了三种不同数据集（RLTD、MU3D、OpSpam），并系统分析了零样本、少样本等实验设置对欺骗检测的影响。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在文本欺骗检测中达到最优性能，而LMMs未能充分利用跨模态线索。辅助特征和提示策略的效果也被分析。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在欺骗检测中的潜力与局限性，为实际应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world
deception detection applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT导致的灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是在无法访问原始预训练数据的情况下。

Method: 通过重建基础模型的SFT指令分布，结合多模型筛选数据，混合新数据进行SFT。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持通用领域泛化能力的同时，提升了任务特定性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为第三方实践者提供了一种更经济有效的SFT解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Conclusion: UniToMBench揭示了当前LLMs在ToM任务中的优势与局限，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现DAAs（如DPO和SimPO）在训练优化目标与推理生成性能间存在奖励-生成差距，主要原因是前缀令牌的重要性未在隐式奖励函数中体现。

Method: 提出POET方法，截断偏好和非偏好响应至相同长度，使优化目标收敛于所有位置，更关注前缀令牌。

Result: 实验表明POET在DPO和SimPO上表现优于标准实现，AlpacaEval 2提升15.6分，下游任务整体改进。

Conclusion: POET通过解决奖励优化与生成性能的不匹配，提升了DAAs的效果。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

Motivation: 自杀是西方国家的主要死因之一，社交媒体数据为研究自杀行为提供了新视角。

Method: 采用三种方法：计算自下而上、混合和专家自上而下，分析181个自杀未遂者和134个对照者的YouTube频道数据。

Result: 发现五个与自杀未遂相关的主题，其中两个随时间变化显著；专家未识别的平台特定指标（如YouTube互动）具有价值。

Conclusion: 综合方法提供了对自杀行为的深入理解，连接了数字行为与临床认知。

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at

*Bingheng Wu,Jingze Shi,Yifan Wu,Nan Tang,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（RoPE），解决了Transformer和状态空间模型（SSM）在位置编码上的不兼容问题，并提出了一个混合架构模型，显著提升了训练和推理速度以及准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer和SSM在长序列建模中各有优势，但两者的位置编码机制不兼容，导致性能下降。为了解决这一问题，研究提出了一种统一的位置编码方法。

Method: 提出了一种统一的旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）方法，并将其应用于结合Transformer和SSM的混合架构模型（model）。

Result: 在4K序列长度下，模型的训练和推理速度分别比标准Transformer快42.3%和29.5%，语言建模任务中准确性提升超过4%，且模型扩展性更好。

Conclusion: 统一的位置编码解决了混合模型中的位置不兼容问题，实现了高效且高性能的长上下文建模。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在知识密集型医疗问答中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过多代理验证和优化过程构建ReasonMed数据集，结合Chain-of-Thought推理和答案摘要进行模型训练。

Result: ReasonMed-7B模型在性能上优于同类模型，甚至在PubMedQA上超越了LLaMA3.1-70B。

Conclusion: ReasonMed数据集和训练策略为医疗推理模型提供了新的基准，展示了结合详细推理和简洁答案的有效性。

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

*Dingjun Wu,Yukun Yan,Zhenghao Liu,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-Infused RAG通过结合知识图谱（KG）和检索增强生成（RAG），提升事实准确性并实现多源检索，性能优于传统RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖单一知识源且缺乏认知启发的知识激活机制，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出KG-Infused RAG框架，整合知识图谱实现概念关联与推理，并通过偏好学习优化关键步骤。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试中，KG-Infused RAG性能提升3.8%至13.8%，且能作为插件增强其他RAG方法。

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG是一种高效、可扩展的多源检索增强生成方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

Motivation: 由于情感的主观性和自然条件下数据的不平衡分布，情感识别（SER）任务具有挑战性。

Method: MEDUSA采用四阶段训练流程：前两阶段训练基于DeepSER的集成分类器，后两阶段优化可训练的元分类器，结合了Manifold MixUp正则化和多任务学习。

Result: MEDUSA在Interspeech 2025挑战赛的情感识别任务中排名第一。

Conclusion: MEDUSA通过多模态和分阶段训练，显著提升了自然条件下情感识别的性能。

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and
their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a
multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively
handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity. The first two stages train an
ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep
cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised
acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further
regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human
annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and
multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion
Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Google Translate和DeepL在英语到希腊语翻译中的性别偏见，发现两者在性别明确时表现良好，但在性别未指定时表现不佳。GPT-4o显示出缓解偏见的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对包容性语言需求的增加，机器翻译系统可能强化性别刻板印象的问题引起关注。

Method: 研究使用GendEL数据集（240个句子），分析两种商业MT系统和GPT-4o在性别偏见三个方面的表现。

Result: 两种MT系统在性别明确时表现良好，但在性别未指定时表现不佳；GPT-4o在大多数模糊情况下能生成合适的性别明确或中性翻译。

Conclusion: 商业MT系统仍需改进以实现性别包容性翻译，GPT-4o显示出潜力但仍有残余偏见。

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球技术普及需求增加，但LLM在低资源语言（如马其顿语）中能力有限，限制了其应用。

Method: 收集了40GB马其顿语语料库（3.5B词）、106k条指令数据集，构建了包含7个基准的评估套件，并训练了8B参数的domestic-yak模型。

Result: domestic-yak在8B参数范围内优于所有基线模型，性能接近10倍大的模型，且文化适应性和语法正确性更受母语者青睐。

Conclusion: 公开数据集、代码和模型权重，为低资源语言的LLM研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhances factual grounding and reasoning capabilities.
This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs,
categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which
improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question
answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion,
and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and
highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to
existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational
efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions,
including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability,
and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型（LMs）的记忆行为受序列的潜在结构复杂度（通过内在维度ID衡量）影响，高ID序列比低ID序列更难被记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型在训练中记忆数据的机制，尤其是潜在结构复杂度（ID）对记忆行为的影响。

Method: 通过分析序列的内在维度（ID）与记忆率的关系，研究其在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露下的作用。

Result: 高ID序列比低ID序列更难被记忆，尤其是在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露情况下。

Conclusion: 记忆行为受模型规模、暴露频率和序列复杂度的共同影响，ID可作为抑制记忆的信号。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

Motivation: LLM标注虽廉价但存在不一致性，可能影响下游分析。现有去偏方法（如DSL和PPI）在理论上有效，但有限样本中的表现尚不清楚。

Method: 比较DSL和PPI在不同任务中的性能，分析其随专家标注数量变化的缩放行为。

Result: DSL在偏差减少和效率上通常优于PPI，但表现不一致；两种方法在大数据集下均能实现低偏差。

Conclusion: 去偏方法存在偏差-方差权衡，需进一步研究有限样本中的效率量化指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

Method: 使用Buckeye语料库比较三种模型：基于信息论公式的NDL、传统NDL和N-gram概率预测器。

Result: N-gram模型表现最佳，但信息论公式的加入显著提升了NDL模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调需结合频率、上下文预测性及平均上下文预测性，并整合信息论指标与判别学习信息以优化声学缩减建模。

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

Conclusion: 生成技术可显著提升低资源手语翻译模型的性能，为资源受限环境提供解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

Motivation: 提高大型语言模型对知识边界的意识，以支持自适应推理（如RAG、深度思考或弃权机制），从而发展高效可信的AI。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的‘内部置信度’方法，通过跨层和跨令牌的自我评估来检测知识边界。

Result: 在事实问答和数学推理任务中，内部置信度优于多个基线方法，并能用于高效RAG和模型级联，降低成本同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 内部置信度是一种有效的知识边界检测方法，有助于提升模型的自适应推理能力和效率。

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of
their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This
type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

<details>

Motivation: 无结构化知识编辑（UKE）对更新LLMs的知识至关重要，但现有方法缺乏局部性评估且微调方法表现异常。

Method: 构建了两个数据集（UnKEBench-Loc和AKEW-Loc），用于系统评估局部性；分析了影响FT方法的四个因素，并提出了优化的FT-UKE方法。

Conclusion: 优化的FT-UKE方法在UKE任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了训练方案。

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于逆模型的概率框架，用于量化大型语言模型（LLMs）的不确定性，并引入了新的不确定性度量Inv-Entropy和扰动算法GAAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法缺乏概率基础，本文旨在通过理论分析和系统扰动提供更可靠的不确定性量化框架。

Method: 采用双随机游走视角建模输入-输出对，提出基于逆模型的概率框架，定义Inv-Entropy度量不确定性，并开发GAAP扰动算法。

Result: 实验表明，Inv-Entropy优于现有语义不确定性量化方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架灵活且有效，为LLMs的不确定性量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComfyUI-R1是一个大型推理模型，用于自动化生成AI内容工作流，显著提升了格式有效性和结构完整性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的工作流需要专业知识，学习曲线陡峭，ComfyUI-R1旨在降低这一门槛。

Method: 通过两阶段训练框架（CoT微调和强化学习），结合长链推理数据，生成有效的工作流。

Result: 7B参数模型在格式有效性、通过率和F1分数上表现优异，超越GPT-4o和Claude系列。

Conclusion: 长链推理和代码化工作流对AI艺术创作具有重要意义，ComfyUI-R1展示了其潜力。

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

*Andreas Säuberli,Diego Frassinelli,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在回答教育测试题目时是否表现出类似人类的行为，以加速测试开发。研究发现，虽然较大模型过于自信，但通过温度校准可以使其回答分布更接近人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能作为测试开发的替代参与者，以减少对真人试验的依赖。

Method: 使用18个指令调优的LLMs，基于经典测试理论和项目反应理论，分析其在阅读、美国历史和经济学科目中的表现。

Result: 较大模型过于自信，但校准后更接近人类；LLMs在阅读理解题目中与人类相关性较高，但整体相关性不强。

Conclusion: LLMs在零样本设置下不适合用于教育测试的预研。

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRT是一个后训练框架，旨在提升大型推理模型（LRMs）有效利用代码解释器（CI）的能力，通过Hint-Engineering生成数据并优化模型交互，显著提升了数学推理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（如o1和DeepSeek-R1）在复杂数学运算上效率低或准确性不足，直接结合代码解释器（CI）效果不佳，因此需要一种方法优化LRM-CI的交互。

Method: 通过Hint-Engineering合成代码集成推理数据，手动创建高质量样本，并采用监督微调、拒绝微调和强化学习对1.5B至32B参数的模型进行后训练。

Result: Hint-Engineering模型在五个数学推理数据集上分别提升了32B和1.5B模型的4%和8%绝对准确率，同时减少了30%和50%的token使用量。

Conclusion: CoRT框架显著提升了LRMs在数学推理任务中的表现和效率，证明了Hint-Engineering和代码集成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at

TL;DR: EmoNet-Voice是一个新的语音情感检测资源，包括大规模预训练数据集EmoNet-Voice Big和专家标注的基准数据集EmoNet-Voice Bench，旨在评估40种细粒度情感类别的语音情感识别模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音情感识别数据集在情感粒度、隐私问题或依赖表演性表达方面存在局限，需要更全面的评估资源。

Method: 利用先进的语音生成技术合成模拟特定情感的音频片段，并通过心理学专家验证情感强度标签。

Result: 提出的Empathic Insight Voice模型在语音情感识别上达到与人类专家高度一致的新标准，高唤醒情感（如愤怒）比低唤醒状态（如专注）更易检测。

Conclusion: EmoNet-Voice为语音情感识别提供了隐私保护且情感丰富的评估资源，填补了现有数据集的不足。

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

Method: 提出Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA)，模拟临床运动错误生成合成数据，结合注意力图卷积网络。

Result: 实验显示，EGPA将平均绝对误差降低27.6%，错误分类准确率提升45.8%。

Conclusion: EGPA为临床和家庭康复中的运动质量评估提供了高精度和可解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检测方法仅关注图像语义与文本叙述的对应性，忽略了图像来源的上下文真实性，导致误判。

Method: 构建新闻媒体来源数据集，定义LOR和DTOR任务，并评估六个LLM的零样本性能。

Result: LOR任务表现良好，但DTOR任务性能较差，需进一步优化架构。

Conclusion: 需开发专门架构以提升DTOR任务性能，未来工作可围绕此展开。

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

Result: 在数学和常识推理基准测试中显著提高了推理效率，减少了token使用且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大语言模型的推理性能和成本效益提升提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有基线，即使不进行核训练也保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为幻觉检测提供了一种鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

Conclusion: LLMs的核心语言无关参数空间是其多语言能力的关键，神经元特定训练策略有效。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

Result: 实验显示现有LLM助手在个性化能力上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: PersonaLens为提升对话AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

Conclusion: ASESUM是一种有效的意见摘要系统，能够适应不同领域并生成基于方面的摘要。

Abstract: Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in
online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast
number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts
the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

Motivation: 现有检索头（retrieval heads）在长上下文语言模型中表现有限，需改进以提升检索效率和效果。

Method: 通过聚合输入查询的注意力分数识别QRHEAD，并开发QR-RETRIEVER作为高效检索器，利用注意力质量进行检索。

Result: 在LongMemEval和CLIPPER任务中性能提升超10%，BEIR基准测试中零样本表现优于RankGPT等。

Conclusion: QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER为通用检索器，同时揭示了长上下文语言模型的解释性。

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers
interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

*Hillary Dawkins,Kathleen C. Fraser,Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了社交媒体上AI生成文本的检测问题，发现现有方法在攻击者不公开微调模型时效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体是网络影响力活动的重要载体，AI生成内容可能被用于大规模操纵舆论，因此检测此类内容至关重要。

Method: 通过模拟威胁行为者，构建了一个包含505,159条AI生成社交媒体帖子的数据集，覆盖11个争议话题，测试了多种检测方法。

Result: 在攻击者不公开微调模型的现实假设下，检测效果显著下降，人类实验也验证了这一结果。

Conclusion: 微调模型对检测算法构成普遍挑战，这对所有检测领域均有重要影响。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的逐步指令策略，用于改进大语言模型在依存句法分析中的表现，实现了多语言数据集上的最高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准提示方法在生成结构有效且准确的输出（尤其是依存句法分析）时表现不佳。

Method: 采用逐步指令策略，先进行通用词性标注，再预测句法头和依存标签，并使用简化的CoNLL-U格式输出。

Result: 在17种语言的Universal Dependencies数据集上实现了最高准确率，无幻觉或污染，多语言微调还提升了跨语言泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤在大语言模型解析中有效，提供了一种可扩展且格式一致的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型在塞尔维亚语、克罗地亚语和波斯尼亚语中处理有毒评论的能力，发现添加上下文片段能显著提升检测效果，Gemini模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线有毒语言对资源有限的地区造成实际危害，本研究旨在探索如何通过大型语言模型改善这些语言的毒性检测。

Method: 构建并手动标注了4,500条YouTube和TikTok评论数据集，测试了四种模型（GPT-3.5 Turbo、GPT-4.1、Gemini 1.5 Pro、Claude 3 Opus）在零样本和上下文增强模式下的表现。

Result: 上下文增强模式平均提升召回率0.12，F1分数最高提升0.10；Gemini在上下文增强模式下表现最佳（F1=0.82，准确率=0.82）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化提示设计和阈值校准，可以在低资源语言环境中显著提升毒性检测效果。

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持部分检测的数据与模型解决方案，通过构建FineHarm数据集和提出流式内容监控器（SCM），显著降低了服务延迟并提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全审核方法存在高延迟和训练-推理差距问题，需要一种原生支持部分检测的方案。

Method: 构建FineHarm数据集（29K对提示-响应），提出SCM模型，采用响应和标记级双重监督训练。

Result: SCM仅需查看响应前18%的标记即可达到与全检测相当的F1分数（0.95+），并能提升安全对齐效果。

Conclusion: SCM是一种高效的部分检测方案，显著优于现有方法，适用于实际LLM服务。

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReStNet提出一种可重用和可拼接的网络，通过动态拼接预训练模型适应异构设备资源，实现灵活的效率-精度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在异构IoT设备上部署的挑战，传统压缩方法无法适应动态资源限制。

Method: 通过CKA计算层间相似度选择拼接点，保留大模型早期层和小模型深层，仅微调拼接层。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ReStNet实现灵活的效率-精度权衡，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet为动态资源环境下的模型部署提供高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

*Zhiyu Xue,Reza Abbasi-Asl,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对生成式医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）的安全防御策略，旨在解决有害查询和过度防御问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在生成复杂医学文本时存在安全漏洞，需要拒绝有害查询（如保险欺诈指令），同时避免过度防御导致拒绝良性临床查询。

Method: 提出了一种基于合成临床演示的推理时防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集验证其有效性。

Result: 防御策略显著提升了模型安全性，且未显著降低性能；增加演示预算可缓解过度防御问题。

Conclusion: 混合演示策略在少样本演示预算下平衡了安全性和性能，为Med-VLMs的安全应用提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

Result: 在多个立面数据集上，SAAF模型的mIoU指标优于现有方法，表现出高精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SAAF模型在建筑计算机视觉技术中具有潜力，为多模态学习在建筑领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Motivation: 视频推理领域因缺乏高质量数据和有效训练方法而发展不足，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过DarkEventInfer和MixVidQA数据集及强化学习训练VersaVid-R1模型。

Result: VersaVid-R1在多项视频理解、推理和字幕任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 研究成功填补了视频推理领域的空白，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在两个主要问题：指令调优数据与VQA测试分布不匹配，以及VQA基准测试需要多种视觉能力，难以定位具体能力缺陷。

Method: 提出AVA-Bench，通过解耦14种原子视觉能力（如定位、深度估计等），并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，精准评估VFMs的表现。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，并发现0.5B参数的LLM与7B参数的LLM在VFM排名上表现相似，但计算效率提高8倍。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代VFMs提供了全面透明的评估基准，将VFM选择从经验猜测转变为有原则的工程决策。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模计算机视觉任务中，手动标注数据耗时且易出错，现有工具仍需人工标注每张图像，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: BakuFlow结合了可调节放大镜、交互式数据增强、标签传播和基于改进YOLOE的自动标注模块，支持动态添加新类别和视觉提示。

Result: 工具显著减少了标注工作量，提升了视频数据和动态数据集的标注效率，适用于目标检测和跟踪任务。

Conclusion: BakuFlow通过半自动化和灵活性设计，为计算机视觉和工业场景提供了高效的标注解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型的广泛应用引发了对代表性危害和歧视性结果的担忧，但偏见产生的机制尚未明确，尤其是在无条件生成中。

Method: 训练一组无条件图像生成模型，采用常用偏见评估框架，分析训练与生成分布之间的偏见偏移。

Result: 实验显示偏见偏移较小，但属性分类器的敏感性对结果影响显著，尤其是在属性值呈频谱分布时。

Conclusion: 需改进标签实践，更严格审查评估框架，并认识到属性在社会复杂性中的角色，以更准确地评估偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的普及，确保其在不同文化背景下的公平性能至关重要，但现有方法在减少偏见时存在性能损失或输出不准确的问题。

Method: CAIRe通过将图像中的实体和概念与知识库关联，利用事实信息为每个文化标签提供独立评分。

Result: CAIRe在手动构建的数据集上比基线方法高出28% F1分数，并在两个文化通用概念数据集上与人类评分的相关性分别为0.56和0.66。

Conclusion: CAIRe能够有效评估图像的文化相关性，并与人类判断高度一致，为解决跨文化偏见问题提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化技术CREPA，用于改进视频扩散模型的微调，解决了跨帧语义一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户级视频扩散模型微调在保留训练数据特定属性方面存在挑战，且现有方法（如REPA）在跨帧语义一致性上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA)，通过将帧的隐藏状态与相邻帧的外部特征对齐，优化微调效果。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Hunyuan Video等大规模VDMs上，CREPA显著提升了视觉保真度和跨帧语义一致性。

Conclusion: CREPA是一种广泛适用的正则化技术，能有效提升视频扩散模型的微调效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate
videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable
challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance.
Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown
promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion
models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external
pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In
this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and
empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in
preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we
introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization
technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from
neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including
CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual
fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with
parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across
diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

TL;DR: PatchGuard是一种基于Vision Transformer的对抗鲁棒性异常检测与定位方法，通过引入伪异常样本和定位掩码，显著提升了对抗攻击下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测与定位方法因训练数据仅包含正常样本而易受对抗攻击，PatchGuard旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用前景感知伪异常样本和ViT架构，结合对抗训练和新颖的损失函数增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上，PatchGuard在对抗环境下AD性能提升53.2%，AL提升68.5%，且在非对抗环境下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PatchGuard通过伪异常和ViT架构显著提升了异常检测与定位的对抗鲁棒性，为高可靠性领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一流与匹配模型（UFM），通过统一训练数据，解决了传统方法中宽基线和光流估计分离的问题，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集图像对应在视觉里程计、3D重建等应用中至关重要，但传统方法将宽基线与光流估计分开处理。论文旨在通过统一训练解决这一问题。

Method: UFM采用简单的通用Transformer架构，直接回归(u,v)流，避免了传统粗到细成本体积的复杂性，更易于训练且对大流更准确。

Result: UFM比最先进的光流方法（Unimatch）准确率高28%，比密集宽基线匹配器（RoMa）误差低62%，速度快6.7倍。

Conclusion: UFM首次证明统一训练可以在两个领域中超越专用方法，为多模态、长距离和实时对应任务开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior

Abstract: Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring
high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that
leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface
models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive
masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised
objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across
different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We
evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical
remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic
segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation.
Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks.
The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and
Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of
78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation
task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection
task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing
the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and

Abstract: Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life
quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense,
different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by
manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should
enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn
about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps
about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to
question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the
manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this
paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark
CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data
generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these
manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and
simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we
propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up
a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action
recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the
scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks
faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal
action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.
First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data
enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more
RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better
adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal
spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the
Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature
extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In
addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight
Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to
integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same
architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from
different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we
achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the
competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

Conclusion: AAPT方法通过对抗训练和高效架构设计，成功实现了实时交互式视频生成，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at
delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as
edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent
advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require
extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework
for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the
deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image
domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the
deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold
representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with
GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate
segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does
not rely on large datasets.

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中取得了显著进展，但预训练中包含的敏感信息可能导致不安全内容生成和版权侵权问题。现有方法将不安全概念视为固定词重复擦除，导致模型陷入“词概念深渊”，限制了泛化擦除能力。

Method: SAGE通过语义增强擦除将概念词擦除转化为概念域擦除，利用循环自检和自擦除探索概念域的边界表示；同时提出全局-局部协作保留机制，结合全局语义关系对齐和局部预测噪声保留，减少无关概念的退化。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE在扩散模型的安全生成方面全面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAGE通过语义增强擦除和全局-局部协作保留机制，有效解决了扩散模型中的安全生成问题，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the
characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a
domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With
the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and
streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to
have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the
curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images.
Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from
any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more
complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments.
Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under
zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry
estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all
with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our
ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the
pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding

Conclusion: UniForward在3D场景与语义场统一重建任务中达到最先进性能。

Abstract: We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and
semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields
facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.
However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,
achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical
applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground
truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to
predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated
and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D
scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and
predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we
propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,
eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous
methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained
end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages
semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,
our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields
in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve
high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the
rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can
be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.
Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene

Motivation: 现有方法和数据集局限于有限模态，无法满足实际场景中多模态查询的需求。

Method: 构建ORBench数据集（包含5种模态），并提出ReID5o框架，支持任意模态组合的协同融合和跨模态对齐。

Result: 实验验证了ORBench的先进性和实用性，ReID5o在多种模型比较中表现最佳。

Conclusion: ORBench和ReID5o为多模态行人重识别研究提供了理想平台和解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a
person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query
is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing
methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet
this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called
Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve
effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset
scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset
comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color
pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant
superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and
textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up
investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal
learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and
cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model,
with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive
experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide
range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our
proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/ReID5o_ORBench.

Motivation: 现有基于子空间的方法因静态提取信息几何而无法处理不良分布样本导致的几何失真，影响了OOD检测的准确性。

Method: 提出动态更新先验协方差矩阵的方法，沿实时输入特征方向减少协方差，并在残差空间中约束调整，保留关键数据特征。

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet-1k数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种模型的OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整先验几何能有效纠正不良分布样本的影响，为OOD检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

Motivation: 解决无源域自适应（SFDA）中目标域无标签数据监督不足的问题，同时应对隐私和访问限制。

Method: 1）T3IE增强伪标签质量；2）基于CMSO的可靠伪标签选择；3）可靠性感知训练。

Result: 在胎儿脑和前列腺数据集上表现优于现有SFDA方法，接近目标域监督训练性能。

Conclusion: SRPL-SFDA有效提升伪标签质量和SFDA性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image
segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant
domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal
with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during
adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as
insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this
work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels
method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch
Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw
pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs
with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for
refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that
rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs
(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training
procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used
for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.
Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets
for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA
effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and
improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)
SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is
close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this
work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据在人类动作视频任务中存在不自然特征，限制了其在训练中的效果，尤其是在手语翻译、手势识别和自动驾驶等领域。

Method: 使用可控3D高斯虚拟人模型进行姿态迁移，生成合成人类动作视频数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量合成数据，弥补真实数据中的不足，并开源了相关数据集RANDOM People。

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

Motivation: 旨在通过蒸馏扩散模型，实现高效且灵活的生成去噪器，同时保留迭代优化的优势。

Method: 将无条件评分函数的洞察融入VSD框架，学习生成去噪器，支持从高噪声水平到低噪声水平的样本生成。

Result: NCVSD在类条件图像生成和逆问题求解中表现优异，计算效率高，性能与更大的模型相当。

Conclusion: NCVSD是一种高效且灵活的生成去噪方法，在快速生成和样本质量上均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel
method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We
achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly
characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By
integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD)
framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of
approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide
range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable
properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative
refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian
noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the
test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic
inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through
extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse
problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms
teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes.
Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we
achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法在计算成本、小物体信息丢失和平坦表面建模效率上存在问题，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 采用双分支设计：基于查询的稀疏点分支和BEV分支，通过交叉注意力共享信息并融合输出。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，且推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: ODG有效结合了BEV和稀疏点的优势，提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG
also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient
approaches.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在生成紧密交织的图像-文本输出方面表现不佳，主要由于训练数据集的规模、质量和指令丰富度不足。

Method: 通过SEIR方法构建InterSyn数据集，包含多轮指令驱动对话和紧密交织的图像-文本响应，并开发SynJudge评估工具。

Conclusion: InterSyn和SynJudge为多模态系统的进步提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 轻量级架构结合知识蒸馏和边缘感知策略有效提升了遥感图像描述的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing
image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual
information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high
computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate
transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing
image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while
often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and
object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer
architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers
and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge
distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher
model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an
edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation
and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: HAM有效整合多源域信息，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to
unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities
of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single
model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.
However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)
sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among
sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and
trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and
lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can
effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and
improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose
Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for
CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source
models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and
harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware
historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate
knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source
domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models,
ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了开放集域泛化问题，为高光谱图像分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification
presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in
target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen
domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods
assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the
fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to
negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that
combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement
(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network
(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning
(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty
Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module
extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through
attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while
DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel
pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation
using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable
open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive
rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral
classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the
target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at
https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出的协同MOT框架通过多智能体信息融合和图优化技术，有效提升了3D LiDAR场景中的目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving
systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path
planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing
surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration
of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the
environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking
objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware
optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles.
By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding
boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to
smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In
that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent
detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two
stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive
evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,
where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,
including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various
testing sequences.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims
at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task
guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and
execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing
research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on
pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human
intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,
leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each
demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in
information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new
exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores
policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate
demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize
themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through
self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate
the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental
results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual
Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
the generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.

Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data,
offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term
transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion,
misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered
semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and
enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on
historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all
existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for
unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic
segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering
1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the
earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark
for historical urban understanding. Second,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel
unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It
employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based
on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust
pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label
reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data
without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly
outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for
segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for
quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

*Zetian Song,Jiaye Fu,Jiaqi Zhang,Xiaohan Lu,Chuanmin Jia,Siwei Ma,Wen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinySplat提出了一种无需训练的压缩框架，显著减少了3D高斯数据的存储成本，同时保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法在存储成本上存在不足，且传统压缩方法与架构不兼容。

Method: 结合View-Projection Transformation（VPT）减少几何冗余，Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction（VABR）减少感知冗余，并使用视频编解码器处理空间冗余。

Result: 实现了100倍以上的压缩比，存储大小仅为现有方法的6%，编码时间减少75%，解码时间减少99%。

Conclusion: TinySplat是一种高效且兼容的压缩方案，适用于3D场景重建。

Abstract: The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a
new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on
large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations
from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high
reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D
Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization
are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for
generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward
3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that
systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce
View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by
projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present
Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy
by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis
transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an
off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression
for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the
state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only
6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%
of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransDiff结合自回归Transformer和扩散模型，显著提升图像生成性能，并引入多参考自回归（MRAR）进一步优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合自回归Transformer和扩散模型的优势，解决单一模型在图像生成中的局限性。

Method: TransDiff通过联合建模框架编码标签和图像为高级语义特征，扩散模型估计图像样本分布；MRAR通过多参考自回归提升生成多样性。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FID为1.61，IS为293.4，推理速度显著提升；MRAR将FID降至1.42。

Conclusion: TransDiff为图像生成领域开辟了新方向，结合MRAR进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries
Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling
framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic
features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image
samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms
other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion
models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)
of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster
inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer
and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,
building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm
called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive
generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference
multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more
diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in
subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is
improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open
up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义高斯熵模型和动态调整似然区间的方法，显著提升了点云属性压缩的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中熵参数估计未充分利用信息，且固定似然区间限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入广义高斯熵模型控制尾部形状，并提出Mean Error Discriminator动态调整似然区间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种VAE模型中显著提升了率失真性能，并可应用于其他压缩任务。

Conclusion: 广义高斯熵模型和动态调整方法有效提升了压缩性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point
cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents.
However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized
information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current
methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we
introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape
through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents.
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood
intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model
performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the
entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood
intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves
rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud
attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression
tasks, such as image and video compression.

TL;DR: HAIF-GS提出了一种基于稀疏锚点驱动的动态建模框架，解决了动态3D场景重建中的冗余更新、运动监督不足和非刚性变形建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D场景重建是3D视觉中的基础挑战，现有方法在静态场景中表现良好，但在动态场景中存在冗余更新、运动监督不足和复杂非刚性变形建模困难的问题。

Method: HAIF-GS通过锚点过滤器识别运动相关区域，利用自监督的流引导变形模块和多级锚点传播机制，实现高效且一致的动态建模。

Result: 实验表明，HAIF-GS在渲染质量、时间一致性和重建效率上显著优于现有动态3DGS方法。

Conclusion: HAIF-GS通过结构化动态建模，为动态3D场景重建提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental
challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due
to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion
representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in
existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,
and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively
hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these
limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured
and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It
first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses
redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided
Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,
eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained
deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor
resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level
transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in
rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

TL;DR: ReVisiT是一种简单有效的解码方法，通过引用视觉标记来引导大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的文本生成过程，提升视觉信息的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解码策略未能充分利用视觉信息，导致视觉无关的响应。现有方法通常需要额外训练或多步推理，ReVisiT旨在以低计算成本解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将视觉标记投影到文本标记分布空间，并动态选择最相关的视觉标记，优化输出分布以融入视觉语义。

Result: 在三个LVLM幻觉基准测试中，ReVisiT显著提升了视觉相关性，计算成本降低至2倍。

Conclusion: ReVisiT在提升视觉相关性的同时，减少了计算成本，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

TL;DR: 3DGS的高斯冗余问题通过全局最优传输视角解决，提出了一种高效且通用的轻量化神经渲染方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在辐射场渲染中表现强大，但通常需要数百万冗余的高斯基元，导致内存和渲染资源紧张。现有方法基于启发式重要性评分修剪高斯基元，缺乏全局保真度保证。

Method: 采用最优传输视角，将3DGS压缩问题转化为全局高斯混合缩减。通过KD树分区最小化复合传输散度，生成紧凑几何表示，并解耦几何与外观属性进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需10%的高斯基元即可实现与原始3DGS相当的渲染质量（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS），且优于现有压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何3DGS流程，提供了一种高效且通用的轻量化神经渲染途径。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance
field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian
primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction
approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance
scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global
Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite
transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric
representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color
and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering
quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians;
and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.
Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS
pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural
rendering.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了T2I对抗性补丁在物理世界中不同视角下的攻击效果，本文旨在解决这一问题并揭示文本对补丁角度鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 提出AngleRoCL方法，通过学习通用概念（文本嵌入）来生成具有角度鲁棒性的对抗性补丁，并将其融入文本提示中。

Conclusion: 本研究深化了对物理角度鲁棒性补丁的理解，并揭示了文本概念与T2I生成内容物理特性之间的关系。

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object
detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and
risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness
when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle
robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle
robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their
angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of
generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail
to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce
Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that
learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation)
representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned
concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to
generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to
viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world
experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that
AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial
patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success
rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative
improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research
advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides
insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties
in T2I-generated contents.

Conclusion: 3DGeoDet通过几何表示显著提升模型性能，适用于多样环境，且无需3D信号监督。

Abstract: This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection
approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor
and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key
challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric
cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images
and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D
geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on
predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to
learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly
through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D
awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,
the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision
from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D
geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end
training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art
image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across
diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D
dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19
AP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset. The project page is available at:

parallel (fast but misses nodes), and local iterative (accurate but slow). We
propose GLD-Road, a two-stage model combining global efficiency and local
precision. First, it detects road nodes and connects them via a Connect Module.
Then, it iteratively refines broken roads using local searches, drastically
reducing computation. Experiments show GLD-Road outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, improving APLS by 1.9% (City-Scale) and 0.67% (SpaceNet3). It also
reduces retrieval time by 40% vs. Sat2Graph (global) and 92% vs. RNGDet++

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

Conclusion: SemanticSplat通过联合建模几何、外观和语义，实现了更全面的3D场景理解，提升了实用性和准确性。

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

Conclusion: ECAM模块有效提升了轨迹预测模型的碰撞避免能力，适用于自动驾驶等领域。

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous
driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to
consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal
predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing
methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the
environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces
ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based
module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The
proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models,
improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our
method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when
integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型主要针对2D医学图像，无法捕捉复杂3D解剖结构，导致误诊和诊断幻觉。

Method: HSENet采用双3D视觉编码器感知全局和细节，并通过空间压缩器（Spatial Packer）将高分辨率3D区域压缩为紧凑视觉标记。

Conclusion: HSENet通过高效3D视觉编码和压缩技术，显著提升了3D医学图像与语言理解的性能，为临床决策提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了多人物动作分割问题，并通过新框架和数据集推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse
evaluation settings. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏人工标注时难以构建多部件物体的统一表示，而DeGSS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DeGSS将物体建模为可变形3D高斯场，通过平滑变形建模不同交互状态，并逐步细化部件分割。

Result: 实验表明，DeGSS在准确性和稳定性上优于现有方法，并支持部件级重建和运动关系建模。

Conclusion: DeGSS为多部件物体提供了一种紧凑且连续的表示方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D
representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous
applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches
still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain
multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes
articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry,
appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is
modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting
deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation
that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The
refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of
every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their
kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the
synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset
that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and stability.

Motivation: 研究胎儿和新生儿大脑的快速神经发育需要高时空分辨率的脑图谱，但传统方法依赖大数据，难以应用于病理情况。

Result: CINeMA在准确性、效率和多功能性上超越现有方法，支持组织分割、年龄预测等任务，并能生成合成数据。

Conclusion: CINeMA为脑研究提供了强大工具，代码和图谱已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

Result: 模型在否定提示下准确率平均下降25-29%，GaslightingBench-R上下降超过53%。

Conclusion: 推理模型在信念坚持上存在根本性局限，揭示了逐步推理与信念持久性之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step
reasoning and belief persistence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在推理时改进双编码器视觉语言模型（VLM）组合性的方法，通过分割图像和文本并匹配片段，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双编码器VLM（如CLIP）在组合性任务上表现不佳，而推理时的方法尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 在推理时，将图像分割为小块，提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系），使用VLM匹配图像块与文本片段，并聚合相似性得分。

Result: 该方法在不训练的情况下显著提升了VLM的性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: 推理时处理图像块对性能提升至关重要，未来可进一步优化推理时方法。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期诊断AD（尤其是轻度认知障碍阶段）至关重要，但传统方法主观且成本高。深度学习虽提供自动化方案，但能耗和计算需求限制了其实际应用。SNNs因其稀疏、事件驱动的特性适合AD诊断，但现有SNNs表达能力弱且训练不稳定。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FasterSNN表现优异，效率与稳定性显著提升，支持其实际AD筛查潜力。

Conclusion: FasterSNN为AD早期诊断提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

Result: 基准测试显示现有方法在CHIP上仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: CHIP公开后将推动工业场景6D姿态估计的研究。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is
essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall
short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial
conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings,
while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups
with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm
in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs
captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique
challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe
occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811
RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the
robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP
using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across
different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show
substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by
the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

Conclusion: LADH数据集和结合RGB与红外的方法显著提升了长期健康监测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet
accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent
challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including
detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have
made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational
efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell
instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By
conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a
four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct
labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained
semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially
simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training
instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an
asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive
experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/FCIS.

Conclusion: MPFNet通过多源先验知识融合显著提升了微表情识别性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective
computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to
its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has
been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on
simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit
multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network
(MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We
propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the
Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with
Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture
spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental
psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and
MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive
development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the
evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while
maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of
0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉与语言整合上存在不足，仅依赖视觉描述的语言模型表现更优，表明视觉处理是关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出三种视觉扰动策略（干扰拼接、优势保留混合、随机旋转），可无缝集成到现有训练流程中。

Conclusion: 视觉扰动对多模态数学推理至关重要，揭示了‘更好的推理始于更好的视觉处理’。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态数据的类别分布存在不一致性，现有方法假设模态共享相同类别集，导致模型无法有效利用跨模态信息识别所有类别。

Result: 实验表明，CSCF在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，有效解决了MMHCL任务。

Conclusion: CSCF通过共享语义空间和类别相似性融合，成功解决了多模态异构类别集学习问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share
the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category
distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the
model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing
all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed
Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are
trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize
complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this
task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF).
Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space
to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects
the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty
estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class
similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant
one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets,
effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

Abstract: Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect
to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute
localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference
satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied
scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level
image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences
introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome
these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source
image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates
a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a
lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching
module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first
establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural
constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine
features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV
absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on
relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module
before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental
evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under
various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Reconstructing facial images from black-box recognition models poses a

address the more challenging scenario of model inversion using only similarity
scores. This paper introduces DarkerBB, a novel approach that reconstructs
color faces by performing zero-order optimization within a PCA-derived
eigenface space. Despite this highly limited information, experiments on LFW,
AgeDB-30, and CFP-FP benchmarks demonstrate that DarkerBB achieves
state-of-the-art verification accuracies in the similarity-only setting, with
competitive query efficiency.

TL;DR: Q-SAM2是一种针对SAM2的低比特量化方法，通过线性层校准和量化感知训练，显著提升了效率并保持了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2的计算和内存消耗过高，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用，因此需要一种高效的量化方法。

Method: Q-SAM2采用线性层校准初始化低比特权重，并通过量化感知训练抑制异常值，使网络适应量化阈值。

Result: 实验表明，Q-SAM2在高效推理的同时保持了高精度，尤其在2比特量化下表现优异，比未校准模型提升了66%的mIoU。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2为SAM2提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，适用于资源受限场景，并在量化感知训练和后训练量化中均表现优异。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

TL;DR: FreeZeV2是一种无需训练的6D姿态估计方法，通过几何和视觉基础模型实现对新物体的强泛化能力，显著提升了速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要大量任务特定训练数据的问题，探索无需训练的高效6D姿态估计方法。

Method: 采用稀疏特征提取、特征感知评分机制和模块化设计，支持多实例分割模型集成。

Result: 在BOP Benchmark上达到新SOTA，速度提升8倍，准确率提高5%；集成模型下准确率再提升8%，速度仍快2.5倍。

Conclusion: FreeZeV2证明了无需任务特定训练也能高效准确估计6D姿态，获BOP Challenge 2024最佳方法奖。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in
computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key
challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen
during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training
on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial
computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for
accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we
introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method
that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric
and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves
both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a
sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation
without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that
improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final
ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles
of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks
errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,
where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen
objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable
8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using
ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy
while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall
Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

Result: DreamCS在实验中表现优于现有方法，生成更符合人类偏好且几何准确的3D资产。

Conclusion: DreamCS通过直接学习3D偏好数据，显著提升了文本到3D生成的质量。

Abstract: While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods
often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences.
Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on
hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward
models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to
their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref,
the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D
meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We
then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired
3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling
effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring
paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework
that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit
and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive
experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that
are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be
released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的微表情数据集MMME，首次同步收集了面部动作信号、中枢神经系统信号和外周生理信号，并通过实验验证了多模态融合显著提升了微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情研究仅依赖单一视觉模态，忽略了其他生理模态传递的情感信息，导致识别性能不足，因此需要探索视觉特征与生理信号的跨模态关联机制。

Method: 研究开发了MMME数据集，包含634个微表情、2841个宏表情和2890个同步多模态生理信号试验，并通过实验验证其可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，将微表情与生理信号结合显著提升了识别和检测性能，MMME是目前模态多样性最全面的微表情数据集。

Conclusion: MMME为探索微表情的神经机制和视觉-生理协同效应提供了关键数据支持，推动了微表情研究从单模态视觉分析向多模态融合的范式转变。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an
individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable
interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,
criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME
research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional
information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME
recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.
Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual
features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion
framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study
introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables
synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system
signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming
the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841
macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,
establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and
conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the
dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating
that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting
performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME
dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data
support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the
visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME
research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset
will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理真实世界动态场景的复杂性，DynaSplat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合变形偏移统计和2D运动流一致性分类动态与静态元素，采用分层运动建模处理非刚性运动，并引入基于物理的不透明度估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供更准确、真实且高效的动态场景重建。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了一种直观、紧凑且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用导航代理OctoNav-R1，通过多模态和多能力的自由形式指令进行导航，并设计了OctoNav-Bench基准和Think-Before-Action数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航研究分散在不同任务/能力中，缺乏通用性，因此需要开发能够处理多模态和多能力指令的导航代理。

Method: 提出了OctoNav-Bench基准和TBA-CoT数据集，构建了基于MLLMs的OctoNav-R1模型，采用混合训练范式（HTP）分三阶段训练。

Result: OctoNav-R1在性能上优于以往方法。

Conclusion: 通过TBA-SFT和Nav-GPRO设计，提升了模型的推理能力，为通用导航代理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数，利用Wasserstein距离优化手写文本识别模型，提升其在时间和上下文变化下的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写文本识别因字符集的演化和上下文依赖性而具有挑战性，传统模型在特定子集上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的损失函数，惩罚预测文本字符频率分布与目标分布的偏离。

Result: 实验证明该方法能提升模型的泛化能力和性能，且无需重新训练即可改进现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过字符分布对齐，显著提升了手写文本识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

Result: 现有模型在复杂场景中表现接近随机（50%），远低于人类近乎完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 当前模型与人类直观物理理解存在显著差距，需改进架构和训练方法。

Abstract: We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive
physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys
benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic
objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.
These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding
emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of
tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models
to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and
diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance
evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that
while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face
significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles
in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark
contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This
underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics
understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures
and training methodologies.

Conclusion: Vireo提供了一个统一且可扩展的解决方案，适用于多样化和动态环境中的鲁棒视觉理解。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间结构理解上存在局限，需要一种高效方法提升其几何感知能力。

Method: 通过从现成的3D基础模型（如MASt3R、VGGT）中提取稀疏对应、相对深度关系和密集成本体积，注入预训练VLM中。

Result: 在3D视觉语言推理和3D感知基准测试中表现优于现有方法，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Geometric Distillation为2D训练的VLM提供了可扩展且高效的3D理解路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: 减少3D依赖在数据规模扩大时表现更优，验证了数据为中心范式的有效性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which
aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D
images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally
challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and
ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D
knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding
explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and
ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts
have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera
poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and
the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:
the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as
data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D
knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of
reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated
by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D
inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By
eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and
learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D
inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel
views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed
inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our
data-centric paradigm. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用胶囊网络固有的姿态感知能力，避免依赖专用预测器来实现等变性，从而提升姿态估计任务的性能。

Method: 引入EquiCaps，利用胶囊网络的固有特性实现姿态感知自我监督，并通过多几何变换增加任务复杂性，验证其不变性和等变性。

Result: EquiCaps在旋转预测任务中优于现有方法，3DIEBench-T数据集上R²达0.78，且在多几何变换下仍保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: EquiCaps展示了胶囊网络在姿态感知任务中的潜力，为无预测器的等变方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant
to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual
classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to
encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as
capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware
representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule
Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that
eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance.
Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to
improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our
assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to
enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing
3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical
results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art
equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$

non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant
performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its
generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule

*Tao Liu,Zhenchao Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出E-FPN-BS架构，通过多尺度特征增强和自适应优化解决小目标检测中高、低层特征语义不均衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小目标检测中，高层特征因缺乏正样本锚点而未被训练，导致语义表示缺失，同时低层特征缺乏语义上下文。

Method: 提出E-FPN-BS架构，包含上下文增强模块（CEM）和前景-背景分离模块（FBSM），并引入动态梯度平衡损失（DCLoss）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，验证了方法的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-FPN-BS有效解决了小目标检测中的特征语义不均衡问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Tiny object detection (TOD) reveals a fundamental flaw in feature pyramid
networks: high-level features (P5-P6) frequently receive zero positive anchors
under standard label assignment protocols, leaving their semantic
representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates
dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends
without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic
context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically
converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To
address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating
multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context
Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress
high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the
Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks
that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance
across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss
(DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware
gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our
approach.

*Tilemachos Aravanis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Petros Maragos,George Retsinas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Only-Style方法，通过定位内容泄漏并自适应调整参数，解决风格一致图像生成中的内容泄漏问题，同时保持语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效分离语义内容与风格元素，导致内容泄漏问题。

Method: Only-Style通过定位内容泄漏并自适应调整风格对齐参数，避免内容泄漏。

Result: 方法显著优于现有技术，实现无内容泄漏的稳健风格一致性。

Conclusion: Only-Style为风格一致生成提供了有效解决方案，并提出了新的评估框架。

Abstract: Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a
challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for
style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content
from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as
a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a
method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner
while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content
leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that
controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches
containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best
balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the
localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a
reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any
method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the
stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to
quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired
content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over
state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,
consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content
leakage.

TL;DR: MetricHMR是一种从单目图像中恢复具有准确全局平移的度量人体网格的方法，解决了现有HMR方法在尺度和深度模糊上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法存在严重的尺度和深度模糊问题，导致重建结果在几何上不合理。MetricHMR旨在解决这一问题，实现度量尺度的HMR。

Method: 通过系统分析现有HMR方法的相机模型，强调标准透视投影模型的关键作用，并提出一种基于射线图的新方法，联合编码边界框信息、相机参数和几何线索，实现端到端的度量HMR。

Result: 实验表明，MetricHMR在度量姿态、形状和全局平移估计上达到了最先进的性能，优于现有的HMR方法。

Conclusion: MetricHMR通过标准透视投影模型和射线图方法，成功实现了度量尺度的HMR，为单目图像中的人体网格恢复提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric
human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In
contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth
ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and
global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first
systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the
critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling
metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR
under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel
approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection
to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric
cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization
modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in
metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and
in-the-wild scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合结构-光谱图卷积算子（SSGCO）和证据引导的自适应边学习（EGAEL）模块的方法，用于高光谱图像（HSI）的无监督聚类，显著提升了聚类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络（GNNs）的HSI聚类方法未能充分利用光谱信息，且超像素拓扑图的不准确性可能导致语义混淆。

Method: 提出SSGCO提取空间和光谱特征，并通过EGAEL模块自适应优化边权重，结合对比学习框架实现聚类。

Result: 在四个HSI数据集上，聚类精度分别提升了2.61%、6.06%、4.96%和3.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化特征提取和聚类任务，显著提升了HSI聚类的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class
without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For
large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform
superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,
and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of
different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these
challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator
(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their
representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral
features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)
module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel
topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning
framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering
are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best
compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展视觉问答任务至视频对话场景，探索模型如何结合视觉信息和外部知识进行对话。

Method: 构建了包含2017个视频和5986个对话的数据集，对话需结合视频内容和外部知识。

Result: 提供了基线模型评估结果，并指出未来挑战。

Conclusion: 该任务需要模型同时处理视觉信息和外部知识，数据集公开以促进研究。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaNorm是一种新颖的线性变换方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并结合Hadamard变换，有效减少异常值，实现更激进的激活量化，提升扩散模型的量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成领域表现优异，但其高内存和计算需求限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。现有的后训练量化方法难以处理异常值，且需要复杂的权重和激活变换。

Method: 提出HadaNorm方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并应用Hadamard变换，减少异常值影响，从而实现更高效的量化。

Result: HadaNorm在Transformer块的不同组件中一致减少量化误差，相比现有方法实现了更好的效率-性能平衡。

Conclusion: HadaNorm为扩散模型的量化提供了一种有效解决方案，显著提升了在资源受限设备上的部署潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LEO-VL是一种基于高效场景表示（CFG）的3D-VL模型，通过大规模训练和多样化任务数据，实现了在多个3D QA基准上的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够理解3D场景并执行自然语言指令的3D-VL通用模型，克服数据可扩展性和场景表示的障碍。

Method: 提出LEO-VL模型，采用CFG高效场景表示，并利用超过700k高质量3D-VL数据进行训练。

Result: 在SQA3D、MSQA和Beacon3D等基准上达到最先进性能，验证了CFG的高效性和数据多样性重要性。

Conclusion: LEO-VL和SceneDPO为3D-VL通用模型的可扩展性和鲁棒性提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following
natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a
long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL
models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness,
falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL
generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient
scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed
feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D
perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token
overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL
generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four
domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and
dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA
benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the
efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,
and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce
SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL
models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and
robust 3D-VL generalists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有VQA数据集的不足，提供基于真实场景的挑战性问题，测试模型对因果关系的理解。

Method: 设计五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预测、规划和描述性），并引入质量控制机制防止模型利用简单捷径。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在CausalVQA上的表现显著低于人类，尤其在预测和假设问题上。

Conclusion: CausalVQA揭示了当前系统在时空推理、物理原理理解和替代方案预测方面的不足。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in
natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework
trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks
simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing

models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field.
First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks.
Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing
research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their
performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a
brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections
and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data
principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

Result: VILASR模型在多种空间推理基准测试中平均提升了18.4%的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视觉空间的直接操作，VILASR显著提升了LVLMs的空间推理能力，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Conclusion: 本文方法通过语义引导和顺序渲染，显著提升了绘画生成的艺术性和技术表现。

Abstract: Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to
bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork
and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on
capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke
parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered
output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions
that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an
image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush
strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and
(iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render
the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as
face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns
with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high
fidelity and superior stroke quality.

Motivation: 现有3D对象生成方法通常生成单一融合网格，限制了部件的独立编辑能力。不同对象的分区数量可变，增加了生成难度。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D对象生成提供了更灵活的部件编辑能力，同时保持了高质量和多样性。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality
and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all
parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual
parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of
parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D
object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates
high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically
meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes
all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete
and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show
that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than
previous image-based part-level generation methods.

Abstract: How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of
ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on
real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle
to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This
limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In
this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human
demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator
(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this
heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion
transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate
conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The
resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world
driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.
To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require
reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module
that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm
achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both
expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy
selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D内容生成面临建模时空分布的复杂性和训练数据稀缺的挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用DyMeshVAE架构分离时空特征，结合Rectified Flow训练策略，在压缩潜在空间中实现文本条件生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能快速生成语义准确且时间连贯的动画，质量和效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnimateAnyMesh推动了4D内容生成的实用化，数据和模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention,
yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the
complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D
training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward
framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.
Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively
compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and
temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable
high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based
training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute
the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,
significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.
Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more
accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，通过区域特定的条件绑定，实现了多概念（如多人和物体）的精确动画控制，解决了现有方法在全局条件下无法精确控制多概念的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只能以全局方式注入条件，无法精确控制多概念（如多人和物体）的动画，限制了应用场景。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过掩码预测器自动推断布局信息，并将局部音频条件迭代注入对应区域，实现布局对齐的多模态匹配。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多模态条件下的显式布局控制优于隐式方法和其他现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式布局控制，实现了高质量、可控的多概念以人为中心的视频生成。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MVP基准测试，用于评估视频语言模型的物理世界理解能力，通过最小变化对避免表面视觉或文本线索的捷径解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试因依赖表面线索而容易导致分数膨胀，无法准确评估模型的时空理解和推理能力。

Method: 引入MVP基准测试，包含55K高质量多选题视频QA样本，每个样本有最小变化对，要求模型同时正确回答两个问题。

Result: 人类表现达92.9%，最佳开源模型仅40.2%，随机表现为25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准测试有效避免捷径解决方案，更准确地评估模型的物理世界理解能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

Method: 通过EditInspector基准，利用人工标注数据评估现有模型在多个维度的表现，并提出两种新方法改进编辑评估。

Result: 现有模型在评估编辑效果时表现不佳，常出现幻觉描述；提出的新方法在伪影检测和差异描述生成上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: EditInspector为文本引导的图像编辑评估提供了新基准，新方法在关键任务上优于现有模型。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Motivation: 探索如何通过声音增强3D场景的交互性，使虚拟环境更真实。

Method: 记录人手操作物体的视频和声音，训练rectified flow模型，将3D手部轨迹映射到对应音频。

Result: 生成的音频能准确传达材质属性和动作，人类观察者难以区分其与真实声音。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了通过声音预测增强3D场景的交互性。

Abstract: We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking
the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically
interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating
objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound
pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their
corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other
actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their
corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds
accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often
indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本识别准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAIR任务和TeReDiff框架为图像修复中的文本保真度提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

Motivation: 旨在实现沉浸式、无限制的自我中心动态环境探索，填补自我中心真实世界模拟的空白。

Method: 采用由粗到细的训练流程，先在大规模文本-视频对上预训练，再通过自动构建的同步动作-视频数据微调，并设计了部分解耦的运动注入方案和联合重建框架。

Result: 实验表明，PlayerOne能精确控制多样化人体动作并保持场景一致性，具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PlayerOne开创了自我中心真实世界模拟的新方向，为世界建模及其多样化应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator,
facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic
environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can
accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos
that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured
by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that
first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for
coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous
motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our
automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of
different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme,
enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a
joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and
video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation.
Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise
control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse
scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation
and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world
modeling and its diverse applications.

Motivation: 评估说话人匿名化系统的隐私保护效果，并探讨攻击者训练和评估数据集中语言内容相似性的影响。

Method: 使用BERT语言模型作为自动说话人验证（ASV）系统，分析VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge数据集。

Result: 平均等错误率（EER）为35%，某些说话人EER低至2%，系统决策与语义相似的关键词相关。

Conclusion: 建议重新设计VoicePrivacy数据集以确保公平评估，并质疑依赖全局EER进行隐私评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PE治疗对PTSD有效，但评估治疗师保真度需手动审核录音，效率低。

Method: 微调预训练音频-语言模型Qwen2-Audio，使用LoRA处理30秒音频-转录窗口，基于LLM生成标签并人工验证。

Result: 在313个真实PE会话中，最佳配置（LoRA rank 8，30秒窗口）的MAE为5.3秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为PE治疗保真度跟踪提供了可扩展框架，有望支持临床培训和质量保证。

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Motivation: 可学习特征提取前端在ASR系统中表现不如传统方法，主要原因是过拟合问题，因此需要研究正则化方法。

Method: 研究了音频扰动方法，并提出在STFT域进行掩码以改进SpecAugment的局限性。

Result: 结合两种正则化方法后，可学习特征与传统特征的性能差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: 通过改进的正则化方法，可学习特征提取前端的性能可以与传统方法媲美。

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Motivation: 冷冻电镜（Cryo-EM）在分子生物学中具有革命性意义，但如何建模非刚性构象灵活性和组成变化（如部分缺失）的粒子结构是研究前沿。

Method: 提出了一种基于分层高斯混合模型的3D重建框架，受4D场景重建的高斯泼溅启发，通过部分分割提供归纳偏置以处理构象和组成变化。

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据上揭示了具有生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench基准测试中达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜中的异质性方法提供了新的解决方案，展示了其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

influencing trade, investments, and economic stability. This study leverages
historical USD/BDT exchange rate data from 2018 to 2023, sourced from Yahoo

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an
exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and
a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like
ARIMA (RMSE 1.342). Additionally, a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is
applied for directional prediction, with backtesting on a $10,000 initial
capital revealing a 40.82% profitable trade rate, though resulting in a net
loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends,
showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates
normalized daily returns to capture volatility. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning in forex forecasting, offering traders and
policymakers robust tools to mitigate risks. Future work could integrate

Motivation: 在严格政策领域（如退款或取消规则）中，确保LLM代理始终遵守规则并拒绝违规请求，同时保持自然交互，是一个挑战。

Method: 提出CRAFT系统，利用政策感知策略测试代理的鲁棒性，并引入tau-break基准评估其表现。

Result: CRAFT在客户服务场景中优于传统越狱方法（如DAN提示、情感操纵等），但现有防御策略仍不足。

Conclusion: 需要更强研究驱动的保护措施，以抵御对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

Conclusion: ThinkQE显著提升了查询扩展的多样性和检索效果。

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FMs如何通过无标注数据学习通用视觉特征，减少对人工标注的依赖，并适应特定临床任务。

Method: 分析了150多项研究，涵盖FMs的模型架构、自监督学习方法及下游任务适配策略。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的关键挑战和开放性问题。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by
learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on
manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we
discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

TL;DR: LoREIN是一种新型无监督双先验集成框架，用于加速3D多参数定量MRI重建，结合低秩先验和连续性先验以提高重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前重建方法仅依赖单一先验或物理模型，导致高度不适定逆问题的重建结果不理想，需要更高效的方法。

Method: LoREIN结合低秩表示（LRR）和隐式神经表示（INR），利用双先验增强重建保真度。

Result: 该方法能够高保真重建加权图像，并提升定量参数图的重建精度。

Conclusion: LoREIN为零样本学习范式提供了潜力，推动了医学影像领域的进步。

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further
enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.
Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad
potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction
tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and
strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In
this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both
brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages.
We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural
networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to
classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and
augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to
ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and
prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation.
The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\%
and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly
better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time
diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This
research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality
detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement
through larger datasets and multi modal inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统组织病理学诊断在资源匮乏地区难以普及，而口腔细胞学刷片检查虽成本低、侵入性小，但仍需解决观察者差异和专家不足的问题。AI可为此提供解决方案。

Method: 研究团队收集了来自印度十个三级医疗中心的PAP和MGG染色口腔细胞学切片数据，并由病理专家标注，用于训练高容量AI模型。

Result: 该数据集填补了公开口腔细胞学数据的空白，有望提升AI驱动的自动化检测能力，减少诊断错误。

Conclusion: 该资源有助于改善资源匮乏地区的OSCC早期诊断，降低死亡率，提升全球患者预后。

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden,
particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where
it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection
dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent
survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited
accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive,
resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral
cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost
alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability
and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial
intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access
to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that
generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter
oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with
Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten
tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by
expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is
designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in
publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance
automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis
in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality
and better patient outcomes worldwide.

Method: 使用单隐藏层ReLU激活的INR和傅里叶特征层，结合广义权重衰减正则化，研究图像恢复的采样需求。

Result: 确定了INR训练问题中图像精确恢复所需的足够傅里叶样本数量，并通过实验验证了低宽度INR的恢复概率。

Conclusion: INRs在解决线性逆问题中具有潜力，理论分析为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs
represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network
taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel
representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating
images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end,
we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image
from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with
ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight
decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this
non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex
penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a
sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is
exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our
theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of
images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the
performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom
images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的威胁模型，用于系统比较针对安全调整大语言模型（LLM）的越狱攻击方法。通过构建N-gram语言模型，评估攻击的流畅性和计算成本，发现离散优化攻击优于基于LLM的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击方法在流畅性和计算成本上差异显著，缺乏统一的评估标准。

Method: 构建N-gram语言模型（基于1T token），提供LLM无关、非参数化且可解释的评估框架，并适配流行攻击方法进行比较。

Result: 发现攻击成功率低于以往报告，离散优化攻击显著优于基于LLM的攻击。有效攻击利用罕见bigrams（如Reddit或代码数据集特有）。

Conclusion: 提出的威胁模型为越狱攻击提供了可解释的系统比较方法，揭示了攻击成功的关键因素。

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨记忆与泛化在LLMs中的关系，揭示模型容量如何影响学习行为。

Method: 通过预训练容量受限的Transformer模型，设计字符级任务分别测试泛化（算术外推）和记忆（事实回忆）。

Result: 小模型泛化好但记忆差，大模型记忆强但泛化弱；联合训练时无模型能成功外推。

Conclusion: 预训练可能倾向于一种学习模式，研究为小语言模型设计提供启示。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

Conclusion: SensorLM在传感器数据理解和泛化能力上表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

Result: 通过互信息计算后验隐私估计，验证了变换后嵌入的隐私性和模型性能。

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform在保护隐私的同时有效维持了LLM的实用性。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

TL;DR: Athena-PRM是一种多模态过程奖励模型，用于评估复杂推理问题中每一步的奖励分数。通过利用弱完成者和强完成者之间的一致性生成高质量标签，仅需5000样本即可高效运行，并在多个场景和基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的过程奖励模型（PRM）需要大量时间和资金投入，且自动标注方法（如蒙特卡洛估计）常产生噪声标签且计算成本高。因此，需要一种高效生成高质量过程标签的方法。

Method: 提出利用弱完成者和强完成者之间预测一致性作为可靠过程标签的生成标准，并采用ORM初始化和负数据上采样策略优化PRM性能。

Result: Athena-PRM在多个场景和基准测试中表现优异，如在WeMath和MathVista上分别提升10.2和7.1分，并在VisualProcessBench上超越之前最优结果3.9 F1分数。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM通过高效生成高质量标签和优化策略，显著提升了PRM性能，并在多个应用中展示了其强大能力。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Motivation: LLM在描述概率分布时表现良好，但在生成忠实样本方面存在困难，限制了其在需要可靠随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了Verbalized Rejection Sampling（VRS），一种基于自然语言的拒绝采样方法，通过LLM对样本进行推理和接受/拒绝操作。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其在直接采样基础上有所改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经典概率工具可以通过自然语言嵌入LLM工作流，提高可靠性，无需访问模型内部或复杂提示工程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在空间定位上依赖监督微调方法，但位置感知能力有限，且强化学习等方法难以有效评估位置准确性。

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM微调方法依赖集中式训练，难以满足隐私敏感领域（如医疗）的需求，且缺乏联邦学习下的全面评估基准。

Method: 提出FedVLMBench，集成两种主流VLM架构、四种微调策略、五种FL算法、六个多模态数据集，覆盖单任务和多任务场景。

Result: 发现2层MLP连接器与并发调优是编码器VLM的最优配置，且FL方法对视觉任务的数据异质性更敏感。

Conclusion: FedVLMBench为隐私保护的多模态基础模型联邦训练提供了标准化平台和实证指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证是否能在标准经纬度网格上实现长期稳定的天气预测，挑战非标准空间域转换的必要性。

Method: 引入AtmosMJ，一种直接在ERA5数据上运行的深度卷积网络，采用新型Gated Residual Fusion机制防止误差累积。

Result: AtmosMJ实现了约500天的稳定预测，10天预测精度与Pangu-Weather和GraphCast相当，训练成本极低。

Conclusion: 高效的架构设计比非标准数据表示更能实现稳定且计算高效的长期天气预测。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLAReps的潜在表示方法，用于解决条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中存在的类别特征与无关上下文纠缠的问题。通过CLAReps，模型能够提取出具有判别性的类别特征，并开发了一种名为CaDistill的扩散特征蒸馏方法，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但其建模能力导致类别特征与无关上下文纠缠，难以提取鲁棒且可解释的表示。

Method: 提出CLAReps（典型潜在表示），通过解码生成代表性样本，保留核心类别语义并去除无关细节。基于CLAReps开发CaDistill方法，利用CDM作为教师模型，仅通过CLAReps传递核心类别知识。

Result: 实验表明，学生模型仅使用10%的训练数据（CLAReps），即可实现强对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，更专注于类别信号而非背景噪声。

Conclusion: 研究表明，CDMs不仅可作为图像生成器，还能作为紧凑且可解释的教师模型，推动鲁棒表示学习。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

Result: 实验表明，数据优化（如增加数据量、改进姿态表示）可显著提升运动插值质量，挑战了模型复杂度的主导地位。

Conclusion: 论文提倡以数据为中心的运动插值方法，证明简单模型结合数据优化可超越复杂模型。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition.
This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material
properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color,

alongside the generated video in a differentiable path tracer to robustly
extract PBR materials directly compatible with common content creation tools.

Conclusion: DGS-LRM为动态场景重建提供了高效、通用的解决方案，适用于长距离3D跟踪任务。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D
tracking methods.

Result: 在评估中，发现了36个测试用例不足的任务实例和345个错误补丁，影响了SWE-Bench的排行榜排名。

Conclusion: UTGenerator和UTBoost显著提升了代码生成代理的评估准确性，并揭示了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard

Motivation: 现有密集事件表示方法在事件相机检测中存在噪声累积问题，影响表示质量和检测性能。

Method: 1. 提出密集事件表示方法；2. 设计小波变换去噪方法；3. 结合变换器网络进行目标预测；4. 引入DRCB模块减少推理时间。

Result: 在DSEC、Gen1和1Mpx数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX上实现约35 FPS的高帧率。

Conclusion: WD-DETR通过去噪和高效模块设计，显著提升了事件相机的实时检测性能。

Abstract: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection
performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise
in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which
degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed
detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet
Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event
cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which
enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet
transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such
a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted
features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object
prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic
Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid
encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object
detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that
WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement
our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,
which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic
systems.

<details>

Motivation: 传统评估指标无法捕捉感知系统输出中的不确定性，尤其是在不同环境条件下（如天气变化）的性能波动。

Method: 提出PCD指标，结合SensorRainFall数据集（包含不同天气条件下的传感器数据），通过统计分析方法检测置信度方差的变化点。

Result: PCD能够捕捉天气条件对感知系统性能的影响，而传统静态指标无法做到这一点。

Conclusion: PCD为自动驾驶感知系统提供了一种分布感知的性能评估方法，SensorRainFall数据集为相关研究提供了基准。

Abstract: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental
conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently
stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while
traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to
capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the
Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that
quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,
incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the
SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a
sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear
and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target
objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the
variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD
values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic
thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall
perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.
Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful
reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that
static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure
of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,
while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.
The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Conclusion: DCIRNet有效解决了透明和反射物体的深度估计问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant
challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as
specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead
to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream
geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth
information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel
multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and
depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an
innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary
information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that
progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of
blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into
dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp
success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior
performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various
transparent and reflective objects.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的仿真任务套件，用于评估视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的泛化能力，发现VLA模型虽具备感知和规划能力，但在动作执行上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型的评估不足，传统模仿学习基准缺乏语言指令，新兴基准任务有限且未深入探讨VLM预训练对机器人策略泛化能力的影响。

Method: 引入包含50个仿真任务的统一套件，涵盖语言指令、视觉和对象，系统评估多种VLA架构的泛化能力。

Result: VLA模型具备感知理解和高级规划能力（"良好意图"），但在动作执行上不可靠，且微调可能削弱VLM的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: 发布任务套件和评估代码作为标准化基准，推动研究弥合感知与动作之间的差距。

Abstract: One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional
imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization
capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,
"generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain
insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to
the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that
incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend
to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization
capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies
on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,
which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this
gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across
10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We
systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this
suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that
while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high
level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably
translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution
observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action
execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's
generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code
to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on
closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source
code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/

*Jared Lawson,Rohan Chitale,Nabil Simaan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过定制不透射线标记物来同时估计导管形状和姿态的方法，以减轻介入医师的认知负担，并在微导管导航中实现了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，介入医师需要从双平面透视图像中重建和预测导管运动，认知负担较重。现有导管跟踪方法要么局限于平面分割，要么需要笨重的传感设备，无法适用于神经介入中使用的微导管。

Method: 在导管上布置定制的不透射线标记物，并提出一种设计准则以减少标记物跟踪不确定性的敏感性。该方法在直径小于2毫米的微导管上进行了测试。

Result: 在模拟血管导航中，形状跟踪误差小于1毫米，导管滚动误差低于40度。

Conclusion: 该方法为可操纵导管在双平面成像下的自主导航提供了可能。

Abstract: Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral
vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a
significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally
reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.
Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky
sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in
neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque
markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane
fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these
markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach
was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom
vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors
below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously
navigate under biplane imaging.

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) 是一种基于轨迹自回归建模的新型视觉运动策略范式，通过反向推理生成完整轨迹，实现全局到局部的动作约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅预测下一步动作，缺乏全局目标约束。CoA 旨在通过反向推理和任务目标驱动的动作链（CoT）过程，提升动作生成的全局一致性。

Method: CoA 采用自回归结构，首先生成关键帧动作编码任务目标，随后自回归生成后续动作。设计中包含连续动作表示、动态停止、反向时间集成和多令牌预测。

Result: CoA 在 60 个 RLBench 任务和 8 个真实世界操作任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CoA 通过全局到局部的动作推理，实现了空间泛化能力与策略灵活性的平衡。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: Ming-Omni是一个统一的多模态模型，支持处理图像、文本、音频和视频，并在语音和图像生成方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过单一模型高效处理多模态输入，避免任务特定微调或结构重设计，同时支持音频和图像生成。

Method: 采用专用编码器提取多模态标记，结合MoE架构和新提出的模态特定路由器，集成音频解码器和Ming-Lite-Uni实现生成功能。

Result: 实验表明Ming-Omni在统一感知和生成任务中表现优异，支持上下文感知聊天、文本转语音和图像编辑。

Conclusion: Ming-Omni是首个开源的多模态模型，支持与GPT-4o相当的模态，代码和模型权重已公开以促进研究。

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

TL;DR: 论文质疑完全自主AI代理的可行性，提出LLM-HAS（人机协作系统）作为替代方案，强调人机合作的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主AI系统在可靠性、透明度和理解人类需求方面存在问题，需要探索更有效的人机协作模式。

Method: 提出LLM-HAS框架，通过人类参与指导和控制，结合案例（医疗、金融、软件开发）展示其优势。

Result: 人机协作系统在复杂任务中表现优于纯AI系统，更具信任度和适应性。

Conclusion: AI发展的目标应是增强人机合作能力，而非追求完全自主，未来AI应作为人类能力的补充而非替代。

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

*Eltayeb Ahmed,Uljad Berdica,Martha Elliott,Danijela Horak,Jakob N. Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为意图分解生成（IFG）的方法，通过两阶段采样提高语言模型的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在提高多样性时仅停留在词汇层面，导致推理问题探索不足和对话重复。

Method: IFG将采样分为两阶段：首先生成语义密集的意图（如摘要或关键词），再基于原始提示和意图生成最终响应。

Result: 在数学和代码任务中，IFG提高了pass@k和强化学习验证反馈；在对话任务中，结合DPO提高了多样性而不牺牲奖励。

Conclusion: IFG是一种简单有效的方法，通过调整提示和温度参数，可广泛应用于提升语言模型的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

Motivation: 现代AI的主要挑战是通过观察学习理解世界和行动。

Method: 预训练无动作的联合嵌入预测架构V-JEPA 2，结合大语言模型，并应用于机器人规划任务。

Result: 在多项任务中取得领先性能，如运动理解（77.3 top-1准确率）和视频问答（84.0 PerceptionTest）。

Conclusion: 自监督学习结合少量机器人数据可生成能规划物理世界的模型。

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为动态上下文扰动（DCP）的新型对抗文本攻击方案，通过动态生成上下文感知的扰动，确保语义保真和流畅性，显著提升了对抗攻击的隐蔽性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法通常关注词级或局部文本段落的修改，忽略了更广泛的上下文，导致扰动可检测或语义不一致。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DCP利用预训练语言模型的能力，通过对抗目标函数迭代优化扰动，平衡模型误分类和文本自然性的双重目标。

Result: 实验结果表明，DCP在挑战最先进的NLP系统鲁棒性方面表现出色，生成的对抗样本更接近自然语言模式。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了上下文在对抗攻击中的关键作用，为构建更鲁棒的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated
adversarial strategies.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法难以有效抵抗恶意查询且保持良性输入的实用性，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出视觉安全提示（在输入图像周围添加可训练填充区域）和深度对齐（通过激活空间监督训练提示），增强模型对恶意查询的感知能力。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DAVSP有效抵抗恶意查询并保留良性输入实用性，且具备跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAVSP通过视觉安全提示和深度对齐的联合作用，显著提升了模型的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across
various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit
the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist
malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To
address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP),
which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety
Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It
preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we
propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt
through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent
ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than
prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative
LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while
preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model
generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety
Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its
overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited

paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets

  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom

methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube

Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely
approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for
developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

Motivation: 解决语音基础模型（SFMs）在罕见词识别上的不足，同时避免从头训练CB方法导致的性能下降。

Method: 将现有CB方法与OWSM v3.1结合，冻结预训练参数，利用SFMs的嵌入知识进行上下文偏置。

Result: 在LibriSpeech测试集上，B-WER提升11.6点，整体WER提升0.9点，实时因子降低7.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留SFMs优势的同时，显著提升了罕见词识别性能，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.
