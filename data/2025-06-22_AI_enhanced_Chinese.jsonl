Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and\noverlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We\nevaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:\nfine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While\ntransformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on\ndocument-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops\nnotably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly\nfor rare events and complex attributes.

Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)\nlearning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)\nunlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.\nOur results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central\nrole in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u540e\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\uff08unlearning\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u8ff0\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5757\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u5355\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u540e\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u6709\u5bb3\u6216\u8fc7\u65f6\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u8f6c\u8ff0\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6c\u8ff0\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5757\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u5355\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f83\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

While DETR-like architectures offer a\npowerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent\nlimitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these\nchallenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally\nadvance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.\nFirst, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the\nintegration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves\nthe stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization\nobjective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to\naddress the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which\nseverely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly\nintroduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and\nunlock substantial performance gains.

Under review for NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods.

Specifically, we introduce\npermutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to\nexplore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout\nfiltering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute\nmost to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We\nevaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image\nbenchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently\nsurpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving\ncomparable performance on single-image tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPeRL\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u6392\u5217\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPeRL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u6392\u5217\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c3\u4e2a\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPeRL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PeRL\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text.

This framework is designed to\nrevolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven\nstylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that\nuses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of\nthe style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove\nstyle-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.\nThis gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free\ninjection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy\nbased on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in\nthe fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive\nlearning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a\ntraining-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which\nmanipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the\ncross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and\nvalue of the content-related process are replaced with those of the\nstyle-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the\nmodel. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the\noriginal content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality\nimage-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering\nartist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image\ncontent.

This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The\nexperimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the\nproposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation\nmetrics.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a\nPareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but\noffer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller\nwindows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of\njust 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across\ndiverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear\nattention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context\nperformance, as validated on the RULER benchmark.

Augmented\nreality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on\n2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical\nnavigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise\ndetection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this\npaper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that\nsignificantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery\nprimarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a\nMulti-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture\nsemantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization\n(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for\nreliable initial proposals.

Training high-performance models for this\ntask typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution\nby iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby\nreducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the\nassumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to\ntarget classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often\ncontains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low\nefficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing\nAL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a\nsignificant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for\npathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language\nModel (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine\ntarget and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select\nIn-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In\nsubsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes\nPrototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic\nSampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a\nquery, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public\npathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's\nperformance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Data-Free\nImage Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned\ndata distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.\nHowever, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training\ndata distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To\novercome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted\nData-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model\nas a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts\nknowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to\nguide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately\nalign with the training data distribution.

Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for\nEEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment\nclassification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.\nFurthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various\nsubjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open\nvocabulary eeg-to-text system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faETS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EEG\u548c\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0fEEG\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u5c01\u95ed\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408EEG\u4e0e\u540c\u6b65\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLEU\u548cRouge\u5f97\u5206\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7bF1\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u534710%\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u88ab\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "ETS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47EEG\u5230\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Drawing on international news\narticles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol\ninsurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we\nconstruct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving\ndiscourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram\nvia a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and\npersistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic\ndisruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major\ngeopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected\ncomponents) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative\nstructure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag\npattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order\nmotif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An\nexception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads\nH0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse\nadjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse\nnarrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a\nmathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points\nand directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge\nof specific events.

A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL\nreward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

Existing SD-based\nReal-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,\nresulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to\neffectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the\nlow-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining\nthe extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA\nLearning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion\nmodel, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module\nto aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a\nConsistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from\ndegraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules\nand train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with\nthe temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases\nalternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent\nand detail-rich outputs.

We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for\nextracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based\nrewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference.

Incorrect\nvisualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information\nconveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual\nbugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause\nobvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data\ngraphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good\nunderstanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is\nessential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz\nlibraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz\nlibraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training\nwith numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets.

We\noptimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image\npairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are\nused for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and\nevaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new\nbenchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch).

Although state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in\n3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited\nability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce\nrealistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nabla-R2D3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u53163D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u97002D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNabla-GFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cNabla-R2D3\u901a\u8fc72D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf93D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNabla-R2D3\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u5185\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5148\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Nabla-R2D3\u4e3a3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}
