Accurate deformation modeling\nis essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment\nbetween preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the\nfinite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high\ncomputational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing\nalgorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced\nby pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical\ncorrespondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we\npropose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy\nwhile improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel\nhuman-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables\nsurgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,\nthereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt\ndynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available\ndataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration\nerror of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive\nframework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmethods in volumetric accuracy.

In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an\nautonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which\nadopts a three-stage paradigm for training.

To address this, we adapt the\nproactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier\ninformation disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such\ninterference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce\nPI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value\nupdates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are\nclearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines\nlog-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from\nretrieving previously overwritten values.

We reveal that: (1) current unimodal\nquality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest,\nwhich can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the\nlower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately\ngenerated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text\nmultimodal task into a unified text modality.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCALE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "SCALE\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6761\u76ee\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "SCALE\u4e3aVLM\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this,\nwe propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model\nsampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising\nper-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency\ncontent of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early\nstage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly\nimproves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image\nfidelity and text alignment.

Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm\nin imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an\nobject as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved\nsensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of\nhidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using\nNLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or\nsurfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned\nfrom datasets.

Our MARMOT is a\nself-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient\ndatasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features\nfrom partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the\nunmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts\nfull measurements.

As a variant of AT,\nAdversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in\nenhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust\nfairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness\nagainst some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial\nrobustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying\nfactors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for\ndifferent classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical\nobservation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we\npropose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge\nDistillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.\nSpecifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between\ndifferent classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness\ndegree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment\nis managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.\nAdditionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be\nintegrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of\nrobustness and fairness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aABSLD\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08AT\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u84b8\u998f\uff08ARD\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u522b\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAnti-Bias Soft Label Distillation\uff08ABSLD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u503c\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cABSLD\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ABSLD\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

To improve interpretability, each example\nincludes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons,\nand causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models,\nincluding both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning:\neven the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to\n77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3\nand 92.7 percent).

This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a\nclimate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season\nthat affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower\nwildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions.\nWildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the\nlikelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future\nwildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data\nhas enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models,\naiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and\ntemporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on\ncoarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to\nwildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\\sim\n0.1${\\deg}. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and\nbaseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada,\nleveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite\nimages (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and\nenvironmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two\nmajor deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal\ninputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a\npeak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season\nnever seen during model training.

Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory\nsignal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames,\nimproving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios.

AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\\%. Current\nclinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA\ndiameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet\nthese criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on\nthe maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the\ncomplex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized\nintervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve\nmonitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model\nto predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with\nlocal, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have\nparameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular\nsurface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using\na longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24\nAAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals.

To further enhance discriminative\npower, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.\nExtensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS\nPotsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.

At the scene level, existing SSL methods often\nincorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D\nimages as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches\nare limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory\ndemands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in\n2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL\nframework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the\ncomputational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct\n3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the\nbackbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training\nstrategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D\nand 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with\nreconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric\nlocations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images.

Extracting entities such as\npercentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved\ncompensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the\nsubtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models\n(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to\nthe selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning\nis performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a\nsignificant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important\ncontention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these\nhallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model.

Spanning 10\ncountries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,\n3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over\n10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet\nthe more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging\nexplicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are\nmissed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit\nexpectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while\nimplicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human\njudgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.\nCollectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable\ndirections for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation\nmethodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u663e\u6027\u548c\u9690\u6027\u6587\u5316\u671f\u671b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8T2I\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u671f\u671b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CulturalFrames\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u30015\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "T2I\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u574744%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u672a\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u6587\u5316\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u663e\u6027\u671f\u671b\u5931\u8d25\u738768%\uff0c\u9690\u6027\u671f\u671b49%\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86T2I\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u6587\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While CLIP is focused\non image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands\ncomprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge\nin the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and\nalignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting\nlanguage and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in\nVision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all\nthree discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to\nintegrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both\nvision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image\ncaptions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment.

However, prior work\nhas predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks\nand single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to\ncompositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This\nwork introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile\nagents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation,\nContext Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in\n20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online\nChinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates\nwith an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a\nrange of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that\nUI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents\ngenerally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting\nrepresentative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and\nattention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap.\nInspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient\nscheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nextrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing\nlong-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS\nachieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on\ncompositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without\nsignificantly sacrificing inference overhead.

However, the underlying computational\nredundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In\nthis paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and\nidentify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional\nbranch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic\nstep-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to\nimprove efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the\ninformation gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal.\nLeveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a\ntechnique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost.\nNotably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies\nsignificantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR,\na sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically\nselect the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate\nthe role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark\ndatasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments\nshow SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall\nacceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model\nquality.

Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models\n(e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised\nSAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction\ncapabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus\neffectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image\nsegmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream \"weak-to-strong\"\nconsistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative\nFeature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature\ndiscrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across\nmultiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across\nmulti-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the\nfeatures, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a\nprompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a\nSliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data,\nfulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts.

This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited\nsupervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the\ndifficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which\narises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper,\nwe introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To\ntackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher\nframework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\\emph{Segment\nAnything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced\nby the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality\nsegmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label\ngeneration, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce\ninformative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select\nthe most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring\nrobust network training.

Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing\nunacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs\nto generative models. We call this fidelity.

High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on\nArgoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up\nto +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP\n(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

To address this gap, we investigated brain\nalignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity\nrecorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with\naudio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized\ninstruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned\nMLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that\ninstruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned\nmultimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for\nboth video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear\ndisentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise\ndifferentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain.

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks.

The core\nfunction needed to recreate multiviews consists on the use of MiDaS\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), which allows to extract a depth map from a\nsingle 2D image. Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing techniques are applied\nto improve the overall performance of the extended altiro3D Library. Thus,\naltiro3D can now treat standard images, video streams or screen portions of a\nDesktop where other apps may be also running (like web browsers, video chats,\netc) and render them into 3D. To achieve the latter, a screen region need to be\nselected in order to feed the output directly into a light-field 3D device such\nas Looking Glass (LG) Portrait. In order to simplify the acquisition of a\nDesktop screen area by the user, a multi-platform Graphical User Interface has\nbeen also implemented.

Traditional\nremedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur\nhigh computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work,\nwe propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training\ndynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model\ndependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies\nduring local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns\nclass-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions,\neffectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity\nRegularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature\nrepresentations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability\nto generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing\nmethods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and\nefficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in\nresource-constrained settings.

Its ability to safeguard privacy,\nat the heart of FL, has recently been a hot-button debate topic. To elaborate,\nseveral studies have introduced a type of attacks known as gradient leakage\nattacks (GLAs), which exploit the gradients shared during training to\nreconstruct clients' raw data. On the flip side, some literature, however,\ncontends no substantial privacy risk in practical FL environments due to the\neffectiveness of such GLAs being limited to overly relaxed conditions, such as\nsmall batch sizes and knowledge of clients' data distributions.\n  This paper bridges this critical gap by empirically demonstrating that\nclients' data can still be effectively reconstructed, even within realistic FL\nenvironments. Upon revisiting GLAs, we recognize that their performance\nfailures stem from their inability to handle the gradient matching problem. To\nalleviate the performance bottlenecks identified above, we develop FedLeak,\nwhich introduces two novel techniques, partial gradient matching and gradient\nregularization. Moreover, to evaluate the performance of FedLeak in real-world\nFL environments, we formulate a practical evaluation protocol grounded in a\nthorough review of extensive FL literature and industry practices.

While\nrecent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization,\nexisting methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and\nconflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain\ngeneralization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through\nsharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a\ngradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and\nadversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class\nimbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a\ncurvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes\nunderrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution\nalignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy\nregularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies\noptimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional\nalignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive\nevaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that\nFedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of\ndomain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both\ncentralized and federated settings.

It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and\nprovably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from\ntranslations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition\nof watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine\ntransformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this\nissue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only\nrequires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary\naffine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the\nmax-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against\nnon-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its\nseparability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nbetween the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the\nWasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive\nnoise for instance.
