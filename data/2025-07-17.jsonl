Manuscript submitted for review to the Journal of\n  Computational Literary Studies (JCLS)", "summary": "This study positions large language models (LLMs) as \"subjective literary\ncritics\" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary\nassessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into\nEnglish and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent\nsessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed\nsignificant variations in evaluation consistency ({\\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to\n0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance\nacross stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming\ndistinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session\nwithin-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically\nminimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped\nby RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that\nLLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human\ncritical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers."}

In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages.

Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to\nexisting FR and NR VQA models.

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map\nfrom the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the\noriginal images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

In practice, these\ntargets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers\ndevelop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then\nrefine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make\nthis optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of\nbenchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms\nbaselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models\nrequire less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly\nmatching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities\nand highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale."}

General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such\nas SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of\nthe box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the\nprompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to\nrecognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations\nfor diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has\nbeen trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their\nparts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic\nlandmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another\ngeneral-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection\nand can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO\nis efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in\nsegmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable\npipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical\nlandmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex\noutlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using\nYOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to\naccurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

In\nprevious editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order\nAmbisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge\ninvestigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change\nshifts the focus from more specialized 360{\\deg} audio and audiovisual scene\nanalysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited\nfield-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,\nthe task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane\n(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided\ninto two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track\nintroducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification\nnecessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3\nStereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled\nand converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to\nprocess stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to\nthe typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates\nonscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation\nmetrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,\nwhich assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are\nonscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs\nreasonably well with the stereo audio data."}

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The\nfirst technique is a template representation transformation that sharply\nreduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient\nencoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving\nthe number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show\nthat IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted\ntemplates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification\nover plaintexts."}

Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model\nmerging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the\nparameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on\ndifferent domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which\nminimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the\ndomain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge\nwhile maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant\nregardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.\nExperimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual\nlearning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its\neffectiveness in dynamic scenarios."}

While hippocampal\nneurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale\nneural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during\nnaturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,\nfine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and\norientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video.
