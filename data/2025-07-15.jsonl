In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based\nmodel augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract\ntabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the\nextraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,\nclassifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,\nQuantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;\n(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model\nis pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial\ndocument dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on\neach classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens\nusing B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value\npairs.

To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring.

Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1\nfunction is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which\nemits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and\ncomposable structures within language models enable task-level generalization."}

Through extensive\nbenchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of\nhuman preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human\npreferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider\nthe textual content of responses.

While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance\nacross both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison\nwith prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall\nmarkedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of\nhuman cognition.

The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems.

Interpretation\nremains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a\nradiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency\nphysicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can\nbe a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop\nan explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an\naccuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.\n  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen\nUniversity Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees\nmodel was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and\npulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for\ntraining and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were\nsegmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used\nto explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.\n  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated\ntwelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the\nindependent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications\nfound that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false\nnegatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating\nfrom inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.\n  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory\nperformance, comparable to thoracic radiologists.

In this\nwork, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models\nannotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our\npipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs\nto generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural\nlanguage descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this\napproach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail\nto reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and\ntopological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler\ncharacteristic to provide richer structural insights.
