However, existing MIL methods often\nfail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both\nglobally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally\nthrough -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a\nprincipled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal\ndistribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel\nMIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass.

Project page: https://stereodiff.github.io/", "summary": "Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following\nthe paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained\nvideo diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth\nestimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal\nconsistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are\nfundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically\nbackgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all\nframes, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for\ndynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to\nensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints.\nBased on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth\nestimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with\nvideo depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic\nareas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth\ndiffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of\nboth.

These\nlimitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world\nlanguage tasks.\n  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream\napplications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant\nknowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training\ntechnique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,\nwe present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces\nmemory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also\nintroduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better\nfollow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their\nperformance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.\nFinally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop\nspatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more\ncomprehensively.\n  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results\ndemonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,\nefficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of\napplications.

On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and\ndifferentiability.

Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information\nrepresentation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and\nbenefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity.\nAdditionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap\nbetween the two modalities.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy.

Based on\nsimultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the\nproposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D\nscene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric\nparameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene\nrepresentation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the\ncamera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a\ncomplete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera\nphotometric model.

To address these limitations, we introduce a\nmodification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK\nactivation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states\nequivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple\narchitectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while\nproviding robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering\nthrough targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of\nneuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make\nTopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn\nand represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future\nresearch on model interpretability and controllability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165TopK\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3SAE\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5728\u5206\u6790Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5728Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165TopK\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u76f4\u63a5\u7b49\u540c\u4e8eTopK SAE\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "TopK\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8de8\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5f62\u6210\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "TopK\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with\nForward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging\nboth local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR\nimages. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy,\nnon-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18\nbackbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary\nmasks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach\nachieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with\na 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing\ninference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that\nFFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative\nmargin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and\nimprove surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement.

Yet, a score fails to\ndescribe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.\nBenefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models\n(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.\nThe core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.\nPrevious explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data\ngeneration processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary\nsystems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.\nSpecifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled\nvideo and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a\nhierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific\ndimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning\nprocess. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written\nquality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and\ngeneration efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset\ncontains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for\ninstruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and\njustification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy\nto fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a\nbenchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the\nquality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the\nS2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently\nimproves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video\nLMMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\uff08SIG\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08VQA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\uff08Score2Instruct\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684VQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u63cf\u8ff0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5c06\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eVQA\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIG\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\uff08S2I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42Chain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8c03\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728S2I-Bench\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SIG\u7ba1\u9053\u548cS2I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891LMMs\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, one major challenge is\nthe data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences\nat multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data\nheterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,\nfine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information\ncontained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client\nsemantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this\npaper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)\nto capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous\nclients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and\nconsistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class\nunderlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise\ncollaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive\nlearning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational\nprototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other\nhand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,\nas a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local\nmodel.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals.

Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to\ndomain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with\nlarge inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of\ndiffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting\nintermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature\ncollection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing\nperformance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an\nobject-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class\nprompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object.\nWe also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch,\nbalancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving\nperformance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a\nunified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through\nfeature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and\nunlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection\nperformance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on\n3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods.

Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that\ndeliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major\nchallenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo\nmatching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost\nvolumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information\nand also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and\nregression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale\ncost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising\nroute for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure\nhighly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the\nEnhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with\nsmall-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary\nfeatures into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from\nthe initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These\nfeatures are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a\ncompact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene\ngeometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large\nreceptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a\nhighly accurate disparity map at real-time.

Typically, training data is generated\nusing point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D\nsensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits\nthe generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,\ndomain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological\ninformation, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the\nsource domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware\nModeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach\nmitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized\nby low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological\nrelations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning\ntask.

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench.

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a\ngrowing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are\nlikely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same\nmodels. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity.

Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when\nonly fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked\nwith our BitMark.

Our approach builds upon recent\nadvances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view\nversion of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view\npanoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard\npost-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach\nfor multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating\nnovel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS.\nOverall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being\norders of magnitude faster than existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PanSt3R\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b3D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d562D\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d562D\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMUSt3R\uff0cPanSt3R\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b3D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "PanSt3R\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5feb\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PanSt3R\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To overcome\nthese challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a\nnovel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text\ngeneration with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC\nstep-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image\nand the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of\ncandidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual\nbaseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually\ngrounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time\ncontext alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring\nthe overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted\nacross diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,\nInstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces\nhallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference\nefficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes.

While recent diffusion-based view\nsynthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image,\nthey generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object\nare occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction\nquality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for\nocclusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six\nstructurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image,\nenabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or\nmanual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the\nPix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and\npseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and\nview consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully\nfine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view\ngeneration.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

Automated accurate delineation of\ncardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and\nautomated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep\nlearning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution\ntransformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and\nspatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an\naccurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance\n(CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships\nusing a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and\nspatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep\nembedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies\nimportant features and their spatial localization. The combined edge\ninformation with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces\ninformation-loss during convolution transformations.

These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and\nmetabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a\npatch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline\ncomponents were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled\nspectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.\nThe analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled\nspectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared\nerrors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)\nof the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the\nphantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The\nmodeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on\nthe B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The\nanalysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved\nMSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by\n26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.\nThe performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to\n1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both\ntypes of B0 inhomogeneity.

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,\nnarratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for\npersonalized and engaging story animation.

While increasing the\nnumber of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the\nframe rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.\nMoreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when\nacquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot\ndenoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances\ncontrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the\navailable transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form\ncompound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are\nthen used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,\nenabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical\nstructures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while\nthe underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows\nthe network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the\nconsistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no\ndomain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across\nanatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports\nefficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight\narchitecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers.

We also\nintroduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom\nquantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using\nanalog quantum neural ODEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff09\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ResNets\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ResQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u795e\u7ecfODE ResNets\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u795e\u7ecfODE ResNets\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cc\u5fb7\u5821\u539f\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u795e\u7ecfODE ResNets\uff0cResQ\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
