When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases.

In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking.

SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it\nachieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M\nparameters.

Our open-source\nMAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and\nconsensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion\nparameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding\ndecisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from\nonline math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and\nwhen consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas\n(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus\nin four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,\nhigher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas\non consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust\nimprovements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS\nconsensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code\ncategory showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was\n0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive\npersona.

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

The approach, integrated into an\nonline RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9053\u8def\u5730\u4e0b\u75c5\u5bb3\uff08RSD\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "GPR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684RSD\u8bc6\u522b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D GPR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe\u523098.6%\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea690%\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aRSD\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct\nevaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.\nThis paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in\nthe context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset\ncontaining 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.\nWe evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and\nperformance on PMG. \\textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across\nsix PMo criteria, whereas \\textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in\nterms of process element similarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\uff08PMRs\uff09\u5728LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff08PMo\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PMo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cPMRs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PMRs\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6PMG\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PMo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u542b55\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ca\u4e5d\u79cdPMRs\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4eceLLM\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548cPMG\u6027\u80fd\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30PMRs\u3002", "result": "Mermaid\u5728\u516d\u9879PMo\u6807\u51c6\u4e2d\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u6700\u9ad8\uff0cBPMN text\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aPMRs\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0cMermaid\u548cBPMN text\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, these\nmodels often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as\nthe precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as\nstructure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,\nparticularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as\nfine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In\nthis paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that\nspecifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the\nintegration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By\nunifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself\nas an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The\nmodel is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first\ninterprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise\npositions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push\nthe boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over\n500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,\nand scenarios with complex occlusions.

Their inherent\nambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes\nthem a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of\ntargeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under\nclothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the\npotential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust\nCC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the\ntargeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nPRCC and LTCC datasets.

Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis.

We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual\nclassification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a\nnon-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodule. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three\nconfigurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)\nfine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated\norchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.\nUsing confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator\nmodulates trust across agents.

However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and\ndiverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection\nmodels.

We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem.

The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The\nresults demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information\nwith high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction\nin semiconductor packaging.

The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC\nis a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes\nis imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive\nsmall language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the\nenhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we\naddress the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using\nunstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon\nencoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes\nto capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied\nto the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains\ncomparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat\nclassifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and\nachieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only\narchitectures for structured sequence generation tasks.

To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature\nand depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular\nfoundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of\nthe reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention\nmechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the\nmonocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the\ndepth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure.

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

Tractometry is an\nadvanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to\ninvestigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber\ntracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract\ndifferences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this\nstudy, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely\nAGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation\ntesting to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.\nThere are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel\natlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,\nalong-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a\nnovel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable\nsimultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for\nmultiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets\nwith known group differences and in vivo real data.

However, label noise, which\narises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training\ninstability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with\nnoise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in\nnoisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates\nnoise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity\nand improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive\nAdjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label\ngeneration and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class\ndistributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully\nmanaging noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual\napproach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during\nlocal training, which improves the generalizability of the model.

For the project page, see\n  https://cg.postech.ac.kr/research/Elevate3D/", "summary": "High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer\ngraphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs.\nTo address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that\ntransforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the\ncore of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that\nsignificantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and\ngeometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a\nview-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement.\nUnlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our\nframework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by\nemploying state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures\ndetailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced\ntexture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art\nquality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of\nhigh-quality open-source 3D assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Elevate3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HFS-SDEdit\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u7eb9\u7406\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cElevate3D\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528HFS-SDEdit\u589e\u5f3a\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u76ee\u51e0\u4f55\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "Elevate3D\u57283D\u6a21\u578b\u7ec6\u5316\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f00\u6e903D\u8d44\u4ea7\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "Elevate3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u8d44\u4ea7\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}
