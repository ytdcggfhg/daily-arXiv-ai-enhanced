### [1] [Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender: AI Agents to fact-check YouTube videos and influence opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10577)
*Logé Cécile,Ghori Rehan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI系统，通过两个代理（Truth Sleuth和Trend Bender）在YouTube上检测和挑战错误信息，并促进用户讨论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 错误信息在数字世界中迅速传播，威胁社会，需要创新方法来应对。

Method: 系统结合RAG技术提取和验证视频中的主张，并通过生成评论促进讨论，具有自我改进机制。

Result: 实验显示系统准确性高，能有效影响用户观点。

Conclusion: AI干预在打击错误信息和促进知情讨论方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often
spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel
approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that
not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages
users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system
comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,
Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced
and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender
leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to
generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive
debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to
iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established
benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its
potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings
highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the
potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering
a more informed online space.

### [2] [An Offline Mobile Conversational Agent for Mental Health Support: Learning from Emotional Dialogues and Psychological Texts with Student-Centered Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10580)
*Vimaleswar A,Prabhu Nandan Sahu,Nilesh Kumar Sahu,Haroon R Lone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoSApp是一款基于智能手机的离线对话应用，利用优化的大语言模型为心理健康提供支持，解决了用户可访问性、网络连接和数据隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台在心理健康支持方面存在用户可访问性、网络连接和数据隐私等挑战，需要一种离线解决方案。

Method: 开发EmoSApp，使用Torchtune和Executorch优化并部署LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct模型，基于14,582个心理健康问答对和多轮对话数据进行微调。

Result: 通过学生群体的定性评估，EmoSApp能够连贯、同理地回应用户，并提供相关建议；定量评估显示模型在低资源环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: EmoSApp为便携、安全且高度定制化的AI心理健康解决方案提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an
individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to
expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent
challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and
data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based
solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support
App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

### [3] [Transforming Sensitive Documents into Quantitative Data: An AI-Based Preprocessing Toolchain for Structured and Privacy-Conscious Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10582)
*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化工具链，用于处理法律、医疗等领域的非结构化文本数据，支持隐私敏感的大规模研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化文本数据在公共健康和社会科学研究中潜力巨大，但因隐私和异质性限制难以利用。

Method: 使用本地运行的开放权重模型，通过LLM提示标准化、总结和翻译文本，结合匿名化技术处理敏感信息。

Result: 在瑞典法院案例中验证了工具链的有效性，成功匿名化并保留了语义内容。

Conclusion: 该工具链为隐私敏感的大规模文本分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

### [4] [A Taxonomy for Design and Evaluation of Prompt-Based Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10585)
*Isar Nejadgholi,Mona Omidyeganeh,Marc-Antoine Drouin,Jonathan Boisvert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自然语言解释（NLEs）的XAI分类法，用于透明AI系统的治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，NLEs成为解释模型行为的关键，需要对其特性和治理影响进行系统研究。

Method: 基于可解释AI（XAI）文献，构建了一个适应提示型NLEs的三维分类法：上下文、生成与呈现、评估。

Result: 分类法为研究人员、审计者和政策制定者提供了描述、设计和改进NLEs的框架。

Conclusion: 该分类法有助于提升AI系统的透明度和治理效果。

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

### [5] [AutoRAG-LoRA: Hallucination-Triggered Knowledge Retuning via Lightweight Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10586)
*Kaushik Dwivedi,Padmanabh Patanjali Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoRAG-LoRA是一个模块化框架，通过轻量级LoRA适配器和KL正则化训练，减少大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但其幻觉问题（事实错误）影响了实际部署的可信度。

Method: 结合自动提示重写、混合检索和低秩适配器调优，通过幻觉检测模块和反馈校正循环确保生成内容的准确性。

Result: AutoRAG-LoRA显著减少了事实漂移，同时保持了模型的效率和模块化。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

### [6] [Anthropomimetic Uncertainty: What Verbalized Uncertainty in Language Models is Missing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10587)
*Dennis Ulmer,Alexandra Lorson,Ivan Titov,Christian Hardmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过语言模型表达不确定性以增强用户信任，提出了模仿人类沟通的‘拟人化不确定性’概念，并分析了相关研究和数据偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言模型常以过度自信的方式输出信息，即使准确性存疑，这削弱了其可信度。因此，需要通过语言表达模型的不确定性，以促进人机协作并减少潜在危害。

Method: 论文综述了人类不确定性沟通的研究，调查了当前进展，并分析了语言化不确定性中的数据偏差。

Result: 研究发现，拟人化不确定性（模仿人类沟通方式）能更直观和可信地传达不确定性，但现有研究忽视了相关数据偏差。

Conclusion: 论文提出了拟人化不确定性的研究方向，强调了人机不确定性沟通中的独特因素，并为未来NLP研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

### [7] [PLEX: Perturbation-free Local Explanations for LLM-Based Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10596)
*Yogachandran Rahulamathavan,Misbah Farooq,Varuna De Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLEX是一种无需扰动的局部解释方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，显著提高了解释效率，与LIME和SHAP效果相当但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在文本分类中表现优异，但其复杂性导致解释性差，现有XAI方法（如LIME和SHAP）计算成本高。

Method: 提出PLEX方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，避免后续扰动，实现高效解释。

Result: 在四个分类任务中，PLEX与LIME和SHAP的吻合度超过92%，计算效率提升2-4个数量级。

Conclusion: PLEX为LLM的文本分类提供了一种高效且可靠的解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

### [8] [Emergence of Hierarchical Emotion Organization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10599)
*Bo Zhao,Maya Okawa,Eric J. Bigelow,Rose Yu,Tomer Ullman,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Hidenori Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）能自然形成与人类心理模型一致的情感层次结构，且模型越大层次越复杂。同时揭示了情感识别中的系统性偏见，尤其在交叉性少数群体中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何建模用户情感状态，以确保其伦理部署。

Method: 基于情感轮（心理学框架）分析模型输出中情感状态的概率依赖关系。

Result: LLMs形成与人类心理模型一致的情感层次结构，且存在对社会经济角色的系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了LLMs的情感推理能力，还表明认知理论可用于改进模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

### [9] [Language Models for Adult Service Website Text Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10743)
*Nickolas Freeman,Thanh Nguyen,Gregory Bott,Jason Parton,Collin Francel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了成人服务网站（ASW）广告文本分析在打击性贩卖中的作用，提出了一种高效的定制Transformer模型，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASW广告文本分析因语言复杂性（如表情符号、语法混乱和故意模糊）而具有挑战性，但可用于识别性贩卖受害者。

Method: 研究比较了信息检索方法、预训练Transformer和定制Transformer模型，发现定制模型在有限GPU资源下表现更优。

Result: 定制模型在准确性、召回率、F1分数和ROC AUC上优于BERT-base、RoBERTa和ModernBERT。

Conclusion: 定制Transformer模型为ASW文本分析提供了显著进步，适用于多种下游应用和研究。

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

*Michal Podstawski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用预训练文本嵌入模型增强属性图的语义分析，提升节点分类和关系预测任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 属性图中丰富的文本属性未被充分利用，通过语义分析可以增强图分析任务的效果。

Method: 将预训练语言模型的嵌入技术应用于图的节点和边属性，不改变图结构。

Result: 语义嵌入显著提高了属性图分析的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 文本语义嵌入是增强属性图分析的有效方法。

Abstract: Labeled property graphs often contain rich textual attributes that can
enhance analytical tasks when properly leveraged. This work explores the use of
pretrained text embedding models to enable efficient semantic analysis in such
graphs. By embedding textual node and edge properties, we support downstream
tasks including node classification and relation prediction with improved
contextual understanding. Our approach integrates language model embeddings
into the graph pipeline without altering its structure, demonstrating that
textual semantics can significantly enhance the accuracy and interpretability
of property graph analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MISS-QA是首个评估模型解读科学文献中示意图能力的基准，包含1,500个专家标注示例，覆盖465篇论文。测试了18种前沿多模态基础模型，发现与人类专家存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献中的示意图包含丰富信息，但现有模型在解读能力上不足，需专门基准评估和改进。

Method: 构建MISS-QA基准，包含1,500个标注示例，测试18种多模态模型在解读示意图和回答问题上的表现。

Result: 模型表现显著低于人类专家，尤其在无法回答的问题上暴露局限性。

Conclusion: MISS-QA揭示了当前模型的不足，为提升多模态科学文献理解提供了关键方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces MISS-QA, the first benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate the ability of models to interpret schematic diagrams within
scientific literature. MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over
465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting
schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering
corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the
paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models,
including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant
performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis
of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis
further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key
insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.

### [12] [Testing Hypotheses from the Social Approval Theory of Online Hate: An Analysis of 110 Million Posts from Parler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10810)
*David M. Markowitz,Samuel Hardman Taylor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交平台上的仇恨言论并不因获得社会认可而增加或极端化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在线仇恨言论是否因社会认可而加剧。

Method: 分析Parler平台上1.1亿条帖子，检验社会认可与仇恨言论的关系。

Result: 社会认可与后续仇恨言论无显著关联，甚至在某些情况下呈负相关。

Conclusion: 社会认可对仇恨言论的强化机制在特定平台上可能不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

### [13] [LLMs on Trial: Evaluating Judicial Fairness for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10852)
*Yiran Hu,Zongyue Xue,Haitao Li,Siyuan Zheng,Qingjing Chen,Shaochun Wang,Xihan Zhang,Ning Zheng,Yun Liu,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu,Charles L. A. Clarke,Weixing Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在司法系统中的公平性，提出了一个评估框架和数据集JudiFair，并发现LLMs普遍存在不一致性、偏见和不平衡的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险领域的应用日益广泛，但其司法公平性及其对社会正义的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 基于司法公平理论构建评估框架，开发三个评估指标（不一致性、偏见、不平衡准确性），并在16个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现LLMs普遍存在不公平现象，尤其在人口统计标签上偏见更明显。调整温度参数可影响公平性，但模型规模、发布时间和来源国无显著影响。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个公开工具包，支持未来评估和改进LLM公平性的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

*Ikumi Numaya,Shoji Moriya,Shiki Sato,Reina Akama,Jun Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了对话生成中用户与系统风格相似性对用户偏好的影响，区分了主观与客观相似性，并发现主观相似性与用户偏好强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户与系统风格相似性对用户印象的影响，区分主观与客观相似性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建包含用户偏好、主观风格相似性（用户自评）和客观风格相似性（第三方标注）的新数据集，并进行分析。

Result: 发现主观风格相似性与用户偏好强相关，且主观与客观相似性存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 强调在分析风格相似性与用户偏好关系时，区分主观与客观评价的重要性，并提供了公开数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

### [15] [HanjaBridge: Resolving Semantic Ambiguity in Korean LLMs via Hanja-Augmented Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10920)
*Seungho Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HanjaBridge方法，通过注入汉字意义解决韩语中的语义歧义，显著提升低资源语言模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决韩语等低资源语言中因同音汉字词导致的语义歧义问题。

Method: 在持续预训练框架中引入HanjaBridge，提供所有可能的汉字候选，结合知识蒸馏避免遗忘。

Result: 在KoBALT基准上相对提升21%，并观察到跨语言迁移效果。

Conclusion: HanjaBridge有效提升韩语理解，且无需推理时额外开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

*Kalit Inani,Keshav Kabra,Vijay Marupudi,Sashank Varma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在类比推理任务中与人类表现的对比，重点关注语义表示和显式提示的效果，并评估了模型大小和架构的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs在类比推理任务中是否具备类似人类的推理能力，以及如何通过显式提示提升其表现。

Method: 通过故事类比的映射任务，评估LLMs的语义表示能力（使用句子嵌入）和显式提示的效果，同时比较不同模型大小（8B vs. 70B）和架构（如GPT-4和LLaMA3）的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在类比推理任务中表现接近人类，但缺乏稳健的人类式推理能力；显式提示和模型大小对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在类比推理任务中显示出潜力，但仍需进一步研究以提升其人类式推理能力，模型规模和架构选择是关键因素。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

Abstract: This Working Note summarizes the participation of the DS@GT team in two eRisk
2025 challenges. For the Pilot Task on conversational depression detection with
large language-models (LLMs), we adopted a prompt-engineering strategy in which
diverse LLMs conducted BDI-II-based assessments and produced structured JSON

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在AI任务中表现出色，但对手语生成的影响有限，因其复杂性和独特规则。

Method: 采用逐步提示策略，提取LLM中的手语知识，支持学习和生成过程。

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign通过LLM微调和逐步提示策略，成功解决了手语生成的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分层低秩适应（LoRA）的方法，用于检测英语和西班牙语推文中的性别歧视，通过条件适配器路由显式建模标签依赖关系，并在多语言训练中实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本性别歧视检测任务，通过参数高效微调提升模型性能，同时减少计算和存储开销。

Method: 采用分层LoRA适配器，应用于所有线性变换，显式建模标签依赖关系，并通过多语言训练实现跨语言迁移。

Result: 在仅使用1.67%可训练参数的情况下，性能接近全微调，训练时间减少75%，存储需求降低98%。

Conclusion: 分层LoRA适配器在多语言性别歧视检测任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻消费增长导致个性化推荐系统可能加剧信息茧房和政治极化，现有立场检测研究局限于短文本和高资源语言。

Method: 提出K-News-Stance数据集和JoA-ICL框架，通过语言模型代理预测关键段落立场并聚合推断全文立场。

Result: JoA-ICL优于现有方法，案例研究展示了其在新闻推荐和媒体偏见分析中的实用性。

Conclusion: K-News-Stance和JoA-ICL为立场检测提供了新工具，有助于促进新闻多样性和减少偏见。

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

Motivation: 心血管疾病的及时识别和准确风险分层对降低全球死亡率至关重要，现有模型主要依赖结构化数据，而临床笔记中的非结构化数据包含有价值的信息。

Method: 采用领域适应的大语言模型进行症状提取、上下文推理和相关性分析，结合心血管特异性微调、基于提示的推理和实体感知推理。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和CARDIO-NLP数据集上表现优异，精度、召回率、F1分数和AUROC均有提升，临床相关性高（kappa=0.82）。

Conclusion: LLM在临床决策支持系统中具有潜力，可提升早期预警系统并将患者叙述转化为可操作的风险评估。

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习技术分析低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中的社会情绪，尤其是在历史性事件（如七月革命）中社交媒体评论的情感倾向。

Method: 采用混合Transformer框架（包括BanglaBERT、mBERT、XLM-RoBERTa和提出的XMB-BERT），结合PCA降维和11种机器学习分类器进行情感分析。

Result: 提出的XMB-BERT混合模型与投票分类器组合达到83.7%的准确率，优于其他模型。

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在跨境金融活动中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）改进实体匹配的准确性，相比传统方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨境金融活动的增加需要准确识别和分类外国实体，传统方法因语言和语义问题效果不佳。

Method: 比较了传统算法（如Jaccard、余弦、Levenshtein距离）、Hugging Face的LLMs和接口型LLMs（如Microsoft Copilot、Qwen 2.5）在65个葡萄牙公司案例中的表现。

Result: 传统方法准确率超92%但假阳性率高（20-40%），接口型LLMs准确率超93%，F1分数超96%，假阳性率更低（40-80%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在实体匹配任务中优于传统方法，尤其在处理语言和语义复杂性时表现更佳。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

Motivation: 现有对齐机制无法保护dLLMs免受上下文感知的掩码输入对抗提示攻击，暴露了新的安全威胁。

Method: 提出DIJA框架，利用dLLMs的双向建模和平行解码机制，构造对抗性掩码文本提示。

Result: DIJA在多种评测中显著优于现有攻击方法，最高实现100%关键词攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了重新思考dLLMs安全对齐的紧迫性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

Method: 作者提出了一种框架，展示多个触发器如何在模型中共存，并通过高嵌入相似性的触发器实现鲁棒激活。此外，提出了一种基于层间权重差异的选择性重训练方法。

Result: 研究发现多个触发器可以共存且互不干扰，且触发器在令牌替换或长跨度分隔下仍能激活。提出的防御方法能高效移除触发器行为。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs中更广泛且持久的漏洞，并提出了一种高效的防御方法，为多触发器投毒攻击提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which
handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered
few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%
for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight
OCR-VLM ensembles, when paired with precise prompt strategies and cross-lingual
augmentation, can outperform heavier end-to-end models in high-stakes,

Motivation: 解决LLMs可能记忆并泄露个人信息的问题，特别是如何识别模型中的个人事实关联，以符合GDPR的RTBF要求。

Method: 引入WikiMem数据集（5000+自然语言测试用例）和基于校准负对数似然的度量方法，评估15种LLMs（410M-70B参数）的个人数据记忆情况。

Result: 研究发现记忆程度与主题网络存在感和模型规模相关，为个体层面的数据记忆识别提供了基础。

Conclusion: 论文为动态构建遗忘集以应对RTBF请求提供了可行方法，支持LLMs的隐私合规。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

Motivation: 探索多代理系统（MAS）在定性研究中的潜力，尤其是其在编码和数据标注任务中的表现。

Method: 通过实验研究，使用六种开源LLM和18种实验配置，分析了77,000多个编码决策，比较了单代理和多代理系统的表现。

Result: 温度和代理角色显著影响共识构建，但多代理系统在编码准确性上并未普遍优于单代理系统。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在定性研究中的局限性，挑战了多代理系统能带来更好结果的假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的偏见评估数据集EsBBQ和CaBBQ，用于评估LLM在西班牙社会背景下的偏见表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源主要针对英语和美国社会背景，缺乏对其他语言和社会背景的偏见评估工具。

Method: 基于BBQ数据集，设计了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的平行数据集，采用多选题QA形式评估10类社会偏见。

Result: LLM在模糊场景中表现不佳，高QA准确率常与更强的偏见依赖相关。

Conclusion: 需要更多针对非英语和社会背景的偏见评估工具，LLM的偏见问题仍需改进。

Abstract: Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)
perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable
lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English,
and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the
Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and
CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to
assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSM提取技术存在可扩展性、覆盖不全和自然语言歧义等问题，需要改进。

Method: FlowFSM结合LLM、提示链和链式思维推理，系统处理协议规范并构建结构化规则书。

Result: 在FTP和RTSP协议上实验表明，FlowFSM提取精度高且幻觉转换少。

Conclusion: 基于代理的LLM系统在协议分析和FSM推断中具有潜力，适用于网络安全和逆向工程。

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的方法SAE-LAPE，用于识别大语言模型（LLM）中的语言特定特征，发现这些特征主要出现在模型的中后层，并影响其多语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM的多语言机制具有挑战性，现有研究难以从跨语言表示中分离语言特定单元。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）和特征激活概率方法SAE-LAPE，识别前馈网络中的语言特定特征。

Result: 发现语言特定特征主要分布在模型的中后层，这些特征可解释且影响多语言性能，还能用于语言识别，性能与fastText相当但更具可解释性。

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE方法有效识别了语言特定特征，为理解LLM的多语言机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KV-Latent通过降采样Key-Value向量维度至潜在空间，显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，仅需少量额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder架构的Key-Value缓存逐渐增加成为推理效率瓶颈，影响内存消耗和数据传输带宽。

Method: 提出KV-Latent范式，降采样KV向量至潜在空间；改进Rotary Positional Embedding的频率采样机制以增强稳定性。

Result: 实验显示KV-Latent在减少KV Cache占用和提升推理速度方面效果显著，模型性能稳定。

Conclusion: KV-Latent为构建高效语言模型系统提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale
datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct
formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$

making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

Result: 显著提升了仇恨言论检测性能，并提供了有价值的资源和见解。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了中文仇恨言论检测的解释性研究。

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

Conclusion: Dr.Copilot是罗马尼亚医疗环境中首批实际部署的LLM系统之一，效果显著。

Abstract: Text-based telemedicine has become increasingly common, yet the quality of
medical advice in doctor-patient interactions is often judged more on how
advice is communicated rather than its clinical accuracy. To address this, we
introduce Dr.Copilot , a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system that

quality of their written responses. Rather than assessing medical correctness,
Dr.Copilot provides feedback along 17 interpretable axes. The system comprises
of three LLM agents with prompts automatically optimized via DSPy. Designed
with low-resource Romanian data and deployed using open-weight models, it
delivers real-time specific feedback to doctors within a telemedicine platform.
Empirical evaluations and live deployment with 41 doctors show measurable
improvements in user reviews and response quality, marking one of the first
real-world deployments of LLMs in Romanian medical settings.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，如何使其与人类价值观对齐变得至关重要，以提供清晰、透明且适应变化的模型行为。

Method: 提出上下文控制的值向量识别方法和门控值向量激活方法，确保准确、无偏且不影响模型性能的价值观控制。

Result: 实验表明，ConVA在10种基本价值观上实现了最高的控制成功率，同时保持了LLMs的性能和流畅性。

Conclusion: ConVA方法有效实现了LLMs与人类价值观的对齐，且能抵御恶意输入的影响。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

Motivation: 传统新颖性评估方法（专家判断或引用组合）存在局限性，如专家知识有限、引用组合效果不确定。结合LLM的知识和人类专家的判断能力，可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 从同行评审报告中提取新颖性句子，用LLM总结论文方法部分，用于微调PLMs；设计文本引导融合模块（Sparse-Attention）整合人类和LLM知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在评估方法新颖性方面优于大量基线。

Conclusion: 结合人类和LLM的知识能够有效提升学术论文新颖性评估的准确性，为同行评审提供新工具。

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PMRs在结构、复杂性和可用性上差异大，且缺乏系统性比较，同时PMG方法的评估策略和技术各异，难以对比。

Method: 引入PMo数据集（含55个过程描述及九种PMRs模型），从LLM适用性和PMG性能两个维度评估PMRs。

Result: Mermaid在六项PMo标准中综合得分最高，BPMN text在过程元素相似性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为PMRs的选择提供了实证依据，Mermaid和BPMN text在不同场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a simple weighted loss function to
Transformer-based models for multi-label emotion detection in SemEval-2025
Shared Task 11. Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting
class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes
without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate
BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such
as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients.
The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on
high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes.
These findings underscore both the effectiveness and the challenges of applying
this approach to imbalanced multi-label emotion detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，基准数据污染问题日益突出，导致性能指标虚高，影响对模型真实泛化能力的评估。

Method: DCR框架通过四个粒度级别（语义、信息、数据和标签）检测和量化污染，并利用模糊推理系统合成污染分数，生成统一的DCR因子来调整准确率。

Result: 在9个LLMs（0.5B-72B）上的验证表明，DCR框架能可靠诊断污染严重程度，调整后的准确率与未污染基准相比平均误差在4%以内。

Conclusion: DCR框架计算高效且透明，为常规评估提供了实用的污染检测工具，有助于更公平的比较并提升LLM基准测试的可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large
language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on
the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more
light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed
acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model
fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of
$1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their
associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed
empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in
the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Method: 使用相同的训练方法构建了从1700万到10亿参数的编码器-解码器模型，并在2万亿token上训练。

Result: 编码器在分类和检索任务中优于解码器，解码器在生成任务中表现更佳。通过反向目标继续训练效果不佳。

Conclusion: 编码器-解码器架构在不同任务中各有优势，直接适应任务效果不如专用模型。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific
problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a
single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical
problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy
consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

*Sirui Han,Junqi Zhu,Ruiyuan Zhang,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了HKGAI-V1的开发，这是一个为香港量身定制的本地化大语言模型，通过多语言支持、文化对齐和安全框架，提升了处理本地敏感问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 香港独特的多语言环境、社会法律背景及文化价值观需要专门定制的AI基础设施，以确保AI应用符合本地需求。

Method: 基于DeepSeek架构，通过全参数微调和对齐区域规范，结合检索增强生成（RAG）系统，开发了HKGAI-V1模型。

Result: HKGAI-V1在本地文化敏感查询上优于通用模型，并开发了专有的对抗性香港价值基准测试工具。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了技术成果，还为其他地区开发本地化AI系统提供了可复制的蓝图。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems"
framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful
development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in
handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a
"governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to
exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public
services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary
Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment
with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By
documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological
artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally
focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.

Motivation: 探讨如何有效评估LLM生成的酒店亮点是否忠实于输入数据，以及不同评估方法的优劣。

Method: 通过人类评估活动（分类错误评估和跨度级标注），比较传统指标、可训练方法和LLM作为评判者的方法。

Result: 简单指标（如词重叠）与人类判断相关性高（Spearman秩相关系数0.63），LLM在评估中表现不可靠，易过度或不足标注。

Conclusion: 简单指标在跨域数据中表现优异，LLM生成高质量亮点但评估不可靠，错误信息风险高，众包评估存在挑战。

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet提出了一种基于小波变换和因果推理的低光图像增强方法，通过全局和局部因果分析优化图像增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光图像增强方法忽视实例级语义信息和特征特性，CWNet旨在通过因果推理解决这一问题。

Method: 结合因果推理和小波变换，采用全局度量学习和局部CLIP语义损失，设计小波变换骨干网络。

Result: CWNet在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换有效提升了低光图像增强的精度和适应性。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合外部生物知识的新框架，用于增强显微镜图像分析模型，以解决细胞系异质性对药物筛选的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于细胞系间显著的形态和生物学异质性，传统的扰动筛选方法在新细胞系中效果不佳，需要改进。

Method: 整合外部生物知识（如蛋白质相互作用图和转录组特征），明确分离扰动特异性和细胞系特异性表征。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上验证，通过少量样本微调显著提升了新细胞系的图像分析性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了显微镜图像分析在新细胞系中的泛化能力，适用于药物发现。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

TL;DR: 该研究审计了两个FER数据集，发现其中存在大量摆拍图像，且模型对非白人或深肤色人群存在偏见，可能导致实际应用中的危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FER算法在检测自发表情时性能下降及对不同种族和肤色人群表现不佳的问题。

Method: 随机抽样审计数据集，提出区分自发与摆拍图像的方法，并测试模型对不同肤色人群的预测表现。

Result: 发现数据集中有大量摆拍图像，且模型对非白人或深肤色人群更倾向于预测负面情绪。

Conclusion: 数据集质量和模型偏见可能影响FER模型在真实场景中的表现，需改进数据收集和模型训练以减少偏见。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为兴趣点分配描述符并进行匹配，计算和存储开销大。

Method: 在兴趣点检测阶段直接关联匹配点，无需生成或匹配描述符。

Result: 匹配精度略低于传统方法，但内存使用大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何计算机视觉任务提供了一种高效的替代方案。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Motivation: 航天器在太空环境中易受损害，人工或机器人维修成本高且风险大，需要可靠的自主检测系统。

Method: 使用真实航天器模型和合成背景创建64k标注图像，加入噪声和失真模拟真实环境，并微调YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型进行性能测试。

Result: 模型在模拟实时约束下达到Dice分数0.92、Hausdorff距离0.69，推理时间约0.5秒。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了有效解决方案，性能优异。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

TL;DR: ThinkingViT是一种嵌套ViT架构，通过动态调整计算资源提升效率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定计算预算导致的效率问题，动态适应输入复杂度。

Method: 采用渐进式思考阶段和Token Recycling机制，动态激活注意力头。

Result: 在相同计算量下，准确率提升2.0-2.9个百分点。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT高效且兼容现有ViT，适用于异构硬件部署。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），无需标签即可实现零样本检测，通过动态生成场景特定对象名称并评估其定位和命名性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，扩展性差；现有开放世界和开放词汇检测方法存在局限性（如缺乏语义标签或依赖用户提示）。

Method: 利用LLM生成场景特定对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器进行定位，提出CAAP和SNAP两个新指标分别评估定位和命名性能。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够高效检测和命名新对象。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提高了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

Motivation: 解释CNN的决策过程对高风险领域至关重要，但现有方法如Grad-CAM可能掩盖重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，利用Winsorization技术衰减异常值，并通过用户可调阈值实现语义级调整。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM显著优于Grad-CAM和均匀层平均基线，生成更可解释的热图。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过多层解释和人工控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

Conclusion: 稀疏编码框架提高了模型的可解释性和任务适应性，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 准确跟踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）对医学任务至关重要，但现有模型存在重复分支和过早终止问题。

Method: 提出Trexplorer Super，通过新方法改进性能，并开发了三个难度递增的中心线数据集（一个合成，两个真实）用于评估。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super显著提升了中心线跟踪性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are

However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

*Xiaocong Zeng,Craig Michoski,Yan Pang,Dongyang Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种正则化方法（LVL和LGCL）解决EEG情感识别中的时间尺度标签不一致问题，并在多个模型和数据集上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG情感识别中时间尺度标签不一致（TsDLI）问题，提升模型泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 提出LVL和LGCL两种正则化策略，结合数学原理（有界变差函数和通勤时间距离）和图论框架。

Result: 在DREAMER和DEAP数据集上，LVL和LGCL优于现有方法，LVL表现最佳。

Conclusion: 新方法在标签不一致情况下平衡了预测性能和可解释性，LVL表现最优。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDistill提出了一种几何引导的弱监督自蒸馏框架，通过教师-学生学习和基于视场的掩码增强局部特征学习，用于跨视角定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完全监督学习，需要昂贵的姿态标注，GeoDistill旨在通过弱监督减少标注成本。

Method: 使用教师模型定位全景图像，学生模型预测有限视场图像的位置，通过预测对齐增强特征学习。

Result: 实验表明GeoDistill显著提升了定位性能，并减少了不确定性。

Conclusion: GeoDistill为跨视角定位提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易导致负迁移问题，影响模型性能。

Method: 设计了多任务联合优化框架，结合语义分割和变化检测任务，并通过图聚合原型学习模块实现类别级域对齐。

Result: 在SECOND和Landsat-SCD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD方法有效缓解了多任务冲突，提升了语义变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

Method: RIDFR利用预训练扩散模型，结合内容注入模块和身份注入模块，并通过对齐学习抑制ID无关语义干扰。

Result: 实验表明，RIDFR在身份保真度和视觉质量上优于现有方法，表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDFR为ID特定人脸修复提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了身份保真度和视觉质量。

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

Result: 在ImageNet和HICO-DET等基准数据集上展示了优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的架构显著提升了HOI检测的效率和准确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

Result: 在Gait3D、GREW和BRIAR数据集上验证，RG-Gait显著提升遮挡步态识别性能且不影响完整步态识别。

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保持完整步态性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在视觉任务中的简单性偏差和信息冗余问题。

Method: 使用不同感受野的核和波浪式通道聚合模块，动态捕捉多阶空间特征。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上达到77.7%准确率（3.8M参数），COCO上50.0% AP（21.5M参数）。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计实现了竞争性性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 零样本异常检测在工业应用中需求广泛，但现有方法在批次测试和噪声过滤方面存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: FiSeCLIP结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批次内图像作为参考，并通过文本信息过滤噪声，同时恢复CLIP的局部语义相关性以优化检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等基准测试中，FiSeCLIP在异常分类和分割任务上表现优异，AU-ROC和F1-max分别提升4.6%和5.7%。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为零样本异常检测提供了更强大的基线方法，显著提升了性能，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

Conclusion: SISRNet能有效捕捉细微异常，生成临床准确的报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Result: 在临床数据集上表现优于现有方法，定量指标（RMSE、SSIM等）显著提升，仅需10步采样。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且符合临床偏好，适用于实时医学图像翻译。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）无法理解个性化文本（如“我的马克杯”）以分割用户感兴趣的特定区域，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种文本提示调优的插件方法，采用“负面掩码提议”减少错误预测，并通过注入视觉嵌入增强文本提示表示。

Result: 在FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$和ADE$^\text{per}$等新基准上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持原始OVSS性能的同时，显著提升了个性化开放词汇语义分割的效果。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域协同和物理引导，显著提升了去雾效果和实用性。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Conclusion: FootGait3D有望推动生物力学和多段足部建模研究，适用于临床步态分析、假肢设计和机器人应用。

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

TL;DR: ProLearn框架通过原型驱动的学习方法，解决了医学语言引导分割中的文本依赖问题，提升了在缺乏配对文本数据时的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学语言引导分割依赖配对图像-文本输入，但许多数据集缺乏配对报告，且推理仅限于有配对报告的病例，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出ProLearn框架，引入原型驱动的语义近似（PSA）模块，从文本中提取语义并初始化原型空间，支持无文本输入时的语义引导。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19、MosMedData+和Kvasir-SEG数据集上，ProLearn在文本有限时优于现有语言引导方法。

Conclusion: ProLearn通过减少文本依赖，扩展了语言引导分割的适用性，为临床场景提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

TL;DR: RoMaP是一种新的局部3D高斯编辑框架，通过3D-GALP和正则化SDS损失实现精确的局部编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D神经表示和实例级编辑模型在实现精确局部3D编辑时面临挑战，尤其是高斯泼溅技术因多视角2D分割不一致和SDS损失的模糊性而受限。

Method: 提出3D-GALP模块生成鲁棒的3D掩码，并结合正则化SDS损失（包括L1锚定损失和额外正则化项）实现局部编辑。

Result: 实验表明，RoMaP在重建和生成的高斯场景中实现了最先进的局部3D编辑效果。

Conclusion: RoMaP为3D高斯编辑提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Result: 在花样滑冰和霹雳舞等挑战性场景中，JAR方法优于现有HPE改进网络。

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的方法显著提升了HPE的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Conclusion: GKNet和SKD数据集为非合作航天器的姿态估计提供了高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at

Method: 构建了高质量的3D GPR数据集，并提出基于YOLO模型的交叉验证策略。

Result: 在实地测试中召回率达到98.6%，检测系统可减少约90%的人工工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为RSD自动识别提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Method: 提出Atmos-Bench基准和FourCastX网络，利用WRF和COSP模拟生成高质量3D散射数据，并将物理约束嵌入模型架构。

Result: 在355 nm和532 nm波段上均优于现有方法，无需辅助输入。

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于深化气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the
interpretability of visual recognition models.

Conclusion: KptLLM++为细粒度图像理解和人机交互提供了变革性解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Motivation: 硬样本在行人重识别任务中具有挑战性，尤其在服装变化场景下，其模糊性和缺乏明确定义限制了模型性能。

Method: HSGL框架包含双粒度硬样本生成（DGHSG）和硬样本自适应学习（HSAL），前者生成多样化的硬样本，后者通过硬度感知优化策略调整特征距离。

Conclusion: 多模态引导的硬样本生成与学习为CC-ReID提供了新的解决方案，显著提升了模型的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决了多模态场景表示中的模态冲突问题，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,

proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

TL;DR: 本文评估了开源通用和医学专用视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多个医学基准测试中的表现，发现通用大模型在某些任务上已超越医学专用模型，但推理能力仍是瓶颈，且临床可靠性尚未达标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在医学任务中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估了3B至72B参数的VLMs在八个医学基准测试中的表现，分为理解和推理两部分分析。

Result: 通用大模型在部分任务上表现优于医学专用模型；推理能力普遍较弱；不同基准测试表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 当前模型尚未达到临床部署的可靠性标准，需加强多模态对齐和更严格的评估方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural
image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their
competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation
protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中多模态数据常因传感器故障或隐私保护而不完整，现有方法因模态组合训练梯度冲突导致性能下降。

Method: MCULoRA包含两个模块：MCLA解耦模态组合的共享信息，DPFT动态调整训练比例。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MCULoRA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCULoRA为参数高效训练提供了一种新框架，有效提升了不完整多模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

Motivation: 当前长视频生成模型缺乏专门评估叙事表达能力的基准，现有评估主要依赖简单叙事提示的基准（如VBench）。

Method: 1. 引入Temporal Narrative Atom（TNA）作为基本叙事单元；2. 构建自动提示生成管道；3. 设计基于MLLM的评估框架。

Result: 实验结果显示NarrLV基准与人类判断一致，并揭示了当前模型的叙事表达能力边界。

Conclusion: NarrLV是首个全面评估长视频生成模型叙事表达能力的基准，为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Result: 方法能揭示更细微的歧视模式，且在去偏任务中保持准确性，适用于工业部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续敏感属性的公平性评估和去偏提供了有效工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在多锚点查询中难以区分目标和锚点，以及视角变化导致的空间描述不一致问题。

Method: 1. Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD)模块将复杂查询分解为单锚点描述；2. Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI)模块通过CCVTs整合多视角特征；3. Textual-Scene Reasoning模块综合多视角预测。

Result: 在3D视觉定位数据集中表现优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确空间区分的复杂查询中。

Conclusion: ViewSRD通过结构化多视角分解有效解决了3D视觉定位中的复杂查询和视角变化问题。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Conclusion: YOLOatr在热红外目标识别中表现优异，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

axillary shoot, shoot and whole plant area, along with 50 fine-grained growth
stage classifications based on the BBCH scale. Additionally, we provide 3,616
high-resolution image subset with pixel-wise semantic and instance segmentation
annotations for fine-grained phenotyping. We validated our dataset using a
cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for
classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation.
Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial

estimation of their area. The state-of-the-art computer vision model YOLOv11,
adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk

Result: 实验证明框架有效，实现了高精度的表面重建。

Conclusion: 多基元高斯泼溅框架显著提升了表面重建的表现。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Result: 在DTU和Tanks-and-Temples数据集上达到最优性能，排名第一。

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet有效结合单目与多视角优势，显著提升MVS性能。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为无约束真实场景下的多模态视频字幕提供了高质量基准和数据高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation

our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

*Haoran Wang,Hanyu Pei,Yang Lyu,Kai Zhang,Li Li,Feng-Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLI框架通过NeRV加速INR压缩，提升大图像压缩效率与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视场图像压缩需求增加，传统方法细节保留不足，数据驱动方法泛化性差。

Method: 采用预训练-微调范式、混合精度训练和并行化目标加速INR压缩；引入Hyper-Compression技术提升压缩比。

Result: 在医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为高效大图像压缩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Motivation: 传统统计形状建模方法在复杂血管结构上表现有限，需要更灵活且高保真的几何生成方法。

Method: 结合NURBS参数化和分层扩散模型，生成中心线和径向轮廓，支持零样本条件生成。

Result: 生成与原始数据集高度匹配的主动脉几何结构，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Conclusion: HUG-VAS首次通过NURBS和分层扩散过程统一整合图像先验与生成形状建模，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of vascular geometry is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional statistical shape
modeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity
and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

Conclusion: 3C-FBI在准确性、速度和鲁棒性方面表现优异，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 解决计算机难以模拟人类颜色感知的问题，填补计算颜色表示与人类视觉感知之间的鸿沟。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法，包括初步实验确定可区分颜色刺激、大规模人类分类调查（1000+受试者），并基于数据提取模糊分区和生成隶属函数。

Result: 模型在人类感知对齐上优于RGB、HSV和LAB等传统模型，且具有适应性和反馈机制。

Conclusion: COLIBRI模型在设计和人机交互等领域具有重要应用价值，首次基于大规模人类样本构建颜色属性规范模型。

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的一致性生成方法，扩展了实际应用范围。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Conclusion: 论文为未来研究和应用指明了方向，强调了深度基础模型在解决现有挑战中的潜力。

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

Result: 建议旨在促进透明、有效的公众沟通，提升公众对NLP的理解和支持。

Conclusion: 有效的公众沟通有助于消除误解，推动NLP研究的可持续发展。

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by
rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This
attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP
researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience.
Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and
for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating
with a general audience about LLMs' capabilities and limitations. These
recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public
understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth,
and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research
and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples.
The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the
general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and
encourage support for research.

Motivation: 探索LLM在法律领域（特别是专利考试）中的定量表现及其原因，揭示公众可能高估了这些模型的性能。

Method: 评估了包括GPT系列、Anthropic、Deepseek和Llama-3等模型在欧洲专利资格考试部分内容上的表现，并结合人类专家对文本解释的评估。

Result: OpenAI o1表现最佳（准确率0.82），但所有模型均未达到专业标准（0.90）。专家更重视清晰度和法律逻辑而非答案正确性。

Conclusion: LLM在专利领域仍有不足，需改进逻辑一致性、多模态能力和提示适应性，以实现人类水平的专业能力。

Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual
applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are
underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs --
including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of
the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys.
OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web
Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama
3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for
the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have
passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold
of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are
regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level
performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3
Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the
textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each
model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the
answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert
judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt
wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future
work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive
prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the
outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might
overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a
virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific
limitations that need solutions.

precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback
actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and
effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the
tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all
tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human
annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still
significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four
pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34
(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class
problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching
96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理泊松逆问题时存在局限性，尤其是数据保真项通常采用Kullback-Leibler散度，而现有DEQ模型主要针对高斯保真项。因此，需要一种更适应泊松问题的DEQ模型。

Method: 提出了一种基于镜像下降的DEQ模型，利用非欧几里得几何结构适应数据项，并提供了收敛性保证和高效的计算策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于传统模型，性能接近Bregman Plug-and-Play方法，同时减少了初始化和超参数调优的敏感性。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了DEQ的应用范围，为泊松逆问题提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are implicit neural networks with fixed
points, which have recently gained attention for learning image regularization
functionals, particularly in settings involving Gaussian fidelities, where
assumptions on the forward operator ensure contractiveness of standard
(proximal) Gradient Descent operators. In this work, we extend the application
of DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more
appropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we
introduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a
tailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the
data term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled
training framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the
convergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational
strategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free
inference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional
model-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman
Plug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,
sensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/christiandaniele/DEQ-MD.

specification of network topologies, neuron models, and quantization,
automatically generating deployable HDL. We evaluate multiple configurations

Motivation: 现有未见物体实例分割（UOIS）方法依赖大规模数据集训练，容易过拟合静态视觉特征，泛化能力差。

Method: 基于视觉交互性原理，设计实时交互感知框架rt-RISeg，利用机器人交互产生的体帧不变特征（BFIF）动态分割物体。

Result: 平均分割精度比现有UOIS方法高27.5%，且生成的分割掩码可作为视觉基础模型的提示进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: rt-RISeg通过交互感知实现了高效未见物体分割，为机器人操作任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new
environments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment
unseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen
object instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which
often leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results
in poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution
scenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the
principle that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We
propose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that
continuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a
designed body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative
rotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting
from selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any
learned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline
generates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot
interaction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the
effectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an
average object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art
UOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show
that the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to
vision foundation models for significantly improved performance.

Abstract: Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on
single-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or
recipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at
malls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both
when and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a
Transformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making
process of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering
the characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that
enforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another
that guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the
robot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures
real-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond
decisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.
Our findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social
robots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party
interactions.

TL;DR: LE-Nav是一种基于多模态大语言模型和条件变分自编码器的导航框架，能够自适应调整规划器参数，提升机器人在动态环境中的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统在动态和非结构化环境中表现不佳，缺乏泛化能力，导致性能下降和社会接受度低。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型推理和条件变分自编码器，结合一次性示例和思维链提示策略，实现零样本场景理解和专家级参数调整。

Result: 实验显示LE-Nav生成的参数在多场景和规划器中达到人类专家水平，实际导航测试和用户研究表明其在成功率、效率、安全性和舒适性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LE-Nav通过自适应参数调整和场景理解，显著提升了机器人在复杂环境中的导航性能和社会接受度。

Abstract: Service robots are increasingly deployed in diverse and dynamic environments,
where both physical layouts and social contexts change over time and across
locations. In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that
rely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting
in degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent
approaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional
planners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor
generalization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective
sim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an
interpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal
large language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to
adaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene
understanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the
mapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,
enabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate
hyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and
scenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair
platform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
quantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,
while receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social
acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/LE-Nav.

TL;DR: TRAN-D是一种基于2D高斯泼溅的透明物体深度重建方法，通过分离透明物体与背景并优化高斯分布，显著提升了稀疏视图和动态环境下的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体的3D几何重建因反射和折射等物理特性而具有挑战性，尤其是在稀疏视图和动态环境中。

Method: TRAN-D通过分离透明物体与背景，使用对象感知损失和物理模拟优化高斯分布，减少伪影并覆盖不可见表面。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中，TRAN-D比现有方法平均绝对误差降低39%，单图像更新时精度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: TRAN-D在透明物体重建中表现出色，适用于动态环境且无需重新扫描。

Abstract: Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is
challenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and
refraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse
views and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian
Splatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key
insight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling
focused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate
artifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,
ensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.
Furthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the
reconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and
chain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.
TRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it
consistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based
state-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean
absolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,
despite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\delta} < 2.5 cm
accuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法，使用事件相机和神经网络替代传统惯性传感器，实现了无人机的稳定飞行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多飞行生物依赖视觉而非重力感知进行姿态控制，而飞行机器人通常依赖惯性传感器。本文旨在探索仅依赖视觉的飞行控制方法，以简化系统并提高适应性。

Method: 使用向下事件相机和递归卷积神经网络，通过监督学习训练网络，从事件流中估计姿态和旋转速率。

Result: 实验证明，该方法可替代传统惯性测量单元，实现稳定飞行。网络在泛化性和视野范围方面表现出不同特性。

Conclusion: 视觉飞行控制为微型自主飞行机器人提供了有前景的解决方案，尤其是在无惯性传感器的情况下。

Abstract: Vision is an essential part of attitude control for many flying animals, some
of which have no dedicated sense of gravity. Flying robots, on the other hand,
typically depend heavily on accelerometers and gyroscopes for attitude
stabilization. In this work, we present the first vision-only approach to
flight control for use in generic environments. We show that a quadrotor drone
equipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and
rotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without
inertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural
network trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests
demonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network
is capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight
control loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across
different environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.
While networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best
performance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative
generalization. Our work showcases vision-only flight control as a promising
candidate for enabling autonomous, insect-scale flying robots.

TL;DR: MultiVox是一个新的语音助手基准测试，旨在评估模型如何整合语音和视觉线索，包括副语言特征，以实现真正的多模态理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试未能全面评估语音助手在理解细粒度语音特征和环境声学背景方面的能力，以及如何将副语言线索与视觉信号对齐。

Method: 提出了MultiVox基准测试，包含1000个人工标注和录制的语音对话，涵盖多样化的副语言特征和视觉线索。

Result: 对9个最先进模型的评估显示，尽管人类在这些任务上表现出色，但当前模型在生成上下文相关的响应方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: MultiVox填补了现有基准测试的不足，为评估多模态语音助手的能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered omni models
to act as voice assistants capable of understanding spoken dialogues. These
models can process multimodal inputs beyond text, such as speech and visual
data, enabling more context-aware interactions. However, current benchmarks
fall short in comprehensively evaluating how well these models generate
context-aware responses, particularly when it comes to implicitly understanding
fine-grained speech characteristics, such as pitch, emotion, timbre, and volume
or the environmental acoustic context such as background sounds. Additionally,
they inadequately assess the ability of models to align paralinguistic cues
with complementary visual signals to inform their responses. To address these
gaps, we introduce MultiVox, the first omni voice assistant benchmark designed
to evaluate the ability of voice assistants to integrate spoken and visual cues
including paralinguistic speech features for truly multimodal understanding.
Specifically, MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated and recorded speech
dialogues that encompass diverse paralinguistic features and a range of visual
cues such as images and videos. Our evaluation on 9 state-of-the-art models
reveals that, although humans excel at these tasks, current models consistently
struggle to produce contextually grounded responses.

Result: 在心脏MRI分类任务中，16%的配置优于经典基线，最高准确率提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了识别高效纠缠拓扑的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational
quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most
current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to
task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce
a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically
generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of
constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies
that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond
classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary
matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable
exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using
entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define
unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per
qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and
evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified
64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently
outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing
configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical
model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,
nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the
classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered
up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and
generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT重建方法存在时间消耗大和辐射暴露高的问题，稀疏视图X射线图像重建方法成为研究热点，但现有扩散模型在跨模态潜在空间对齐上表现不佳。

Method: 提出CLS-DM模型，利用跨模态特征对比学习从2D X射线图像中提取3D潜在信息，实现模态间的潜在空间对齐。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和CTSpine1K数据集上，CLS-DM在PSNR和SSIM等指标上优于经典和先进生成模型。

Conclusion: CLS-DM不仅提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果和经济性，还可推广至其他跨模态转换任务，如文本到图像合成。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

Result: 3D MIR方法能高精度恢复3D信息，为磁场图像重建设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习和物理驱动优化结合的潜力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Conclusion: HANS-Net在肝脏和肿瘤分割中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAE在自然图像中表现良好，但在医学图像中因纹理信息的重要性而效果不佳，因此需要一种能更好保留形态特征的损失函数。

Method: 提出GLCM-MAE框架，使用基于GLCM的重建损失函数，并将其转化为可微形式，以保留图像的强度和空间关系。

Result: 在胆囊癌、乳腺癌、肺炎和COVID检测任务中，GLCM-MAE分别提升了2.1%、3.1%、0.5%和0.6%的性能。

Conclusion: GLCM-MAE通过改进损失函数，显著提升了医学图像的自监督预训练效果，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for
self-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are
pre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error
(MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe
that MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural
images as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the
texture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the
strategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)
feature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training
framework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM
captures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss
helps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation
to convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We
demonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed
GLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection
from ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by
3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by
0.6%. Source code and pre-trained models are available at:

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet
high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in
resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often
suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their
ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,
a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)
architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)
computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the
Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive
Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan
mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional
bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational
efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature
extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic
relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,
offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging
technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化的多智能体AI视觉分类框架，通过信任感知的协调和检索增强生成（RAG）模块，显著提升了零样本设置的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体AI在零样本设置中的信任问题，尤其是在视觉和语言理解结合的领域。

Method: 结合通用多模态智能体、非视觉推理协调器和RAG模块，通过置信度校准和图像检索优化信任分配。

Result: 在零样本设置中，信任感知协调和RAG使准确率提升了77.94%，总体达到85.63%。

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent
architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing
challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot
settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual
classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a
non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three
configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)
fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated
orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.
Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator
modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy
improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,
achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL
displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with
visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via
iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision
agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable
multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other
trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components
including the complete software source code are openly released to support
reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github:

Conclusion: 新协议虽重要，但不足以构建稳健、开放、可信的生态系统，未来研究需关注去中心化身份、经济模型、安全与治理。

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,
document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'
behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become
more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across
different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered
frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation
obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic
understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive
evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and
the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations
of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To
systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic
foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery
mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing
agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent
where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift
in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic
Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model
(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable
and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new
protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,
trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies
in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda
focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance
for the emerging WoA.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic
analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We
evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic
analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting
Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and
validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five
LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary
classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing
zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,
GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:
0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely
mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:
16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based
approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for
qualitative research. Keywords: thematic analysis, large language models,

TL;DR: NavComposer自动生成高质量导航指令，NavInstrCritic提供无标注评估，提升语言导航研究的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专家提供的导航指令数量有限，合成指令质量不足，限制了大规模研究。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，支持大规模、通用性研究。

Conclusion: NavComposer和NavInstrCritic解决了指令生成和评估的瓶颈，推动了语言导航研究的发展。

Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents
to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However,
expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 构建更完整的段落检索测试集，提升查询和判断质量，以区分不同方法并支持未来数据重用。

Method: 利用MS MARCO数据集扩展训练标签和集合规模，重点优化段落检索任务，文档排序任务通过段落标签推断。

Result: 大规模预训练的深度神经排序模型表现优于传统方法，但今年密集检索方法的竞争力有所下降。

Conclusion: 段落检索测试集质量提升，未来可重用；密集检索方法表现不如预期，需进一步研究。

Abstract: This is the fourth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous
years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of
human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and
document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$
times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times
increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we
mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage
retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document
ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were
inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to
previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our
judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of
this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish
between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in
overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs
that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they
were last year.

Result: RL在数学领域有小幅提升，而SFT在知识密集型任务上表现更差；SFT对模型参数的修改更显著。

Conclusion: RL可能增强现有能力，而SFT可能替换旧技能；冻结部分模型参数的效果不明确。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code
datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly
popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a
comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same
model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains
on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU,
while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters
across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights
the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer
MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the
out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of
the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with
benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together,
our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing
capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨国企业每天处理大量交易，需遵守不同司法管辖区的税务规定，准确预测税务代码（如HSN或SAC）至关重要，以避免税务处罚。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构的SLM，通过处理非结构化数据，生成层次化的税务代码序列，捕捉其依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在结构化税务代码预测任务中优于扁平分类器、仅解码器或仅编码器架构。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他政府规定的税务代码，如UNSPSC或NCM，展示了在税务合规领域的潜力。

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有补偿式权重校准方法假设一阶项可忽略，但实际中渐进补偿过程会引入一阶偏差，导致假设不成立。

Method: FOEM通过直接计算潜在权重与全精度权重差异近似梯度，避免反向传播的高成本，并利用预计算的Cholesky因子实时恢复Hessian子矩阵逆。

Result: 在3比特权重量化中，FOEM显著降低困惑度并提升准确率，接近全精度性能，且可与先进技术无缝集成。

Conclusion: FOEM通过改进量化误差补偿，显著优于现有方法，并在多种模型和任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is

TL;DR: AirLLM提出了一种分层扩散策略框架，用于通信感知的LoRA适配，通过强化学习和扩散模型优化LoRA的秩配置，显著减少传输成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上运行大型语言模型面临通信带宽和计算资源限制，现有LoRA方法的固定或启发式秩配置及参数传输效率低下。

Method: AirLLM将秩配置建模为结构化动作向量，使用PPO生成粗粒度决策，并通过DDIM细化生成高分辨率、任务和信道自适应的秩向量。

Result: 实验表明，AirLLM在不同信噪比下均能提升微调性能并显著降低传输成本。

Conclusion: AirLLM通过强化驱动和扩散优化的秩适配，实现了高效、可扩展的远程微调。

Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly
challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and
memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.
Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ
fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air
transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address
this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework
for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank
configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted
projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential
decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates
coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic
complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The
two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.
Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM
consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing
transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,
diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning
over the air.

Method: 提出FedGSCA框架，包括全局样本选择器和客户端自适应调整机制（CAA），结合伪标签生成和鲁棒标签损失。

Result: 在真实和合成医疗数据集上的实验表明，FedGSCA在极端和异质噪声场景下优于现有方法，提升了模型稳定性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedGSCA有效解决了医疗联邦学习中的噪声问题，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a

We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two
complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that
preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing
Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and
stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP
thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a
clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be
measured.

Conclusion: LoRA微调是一种高效的日志异常检测方法，显著优于传统全微调技术。

Abstract: Log anomaly detection using traditional rule based or deep learning based

of log sequence. So effective way of detection of anomalous sequence of logs is
crucial for system maintenance and development. This paper proposes parameter
efficient finetuning specifically low rank adaptation (LoRA) and adapter based
approaches for finding contextual anomalies in sequence of logs in large log

substantial performance improvements of 18 to 19 percentage over LogBert based
full finetuning approach, achieving accuracy scores between 97.76% and 98.83%
compared to 79.37%.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is currently the only method for in vivo
mapping of the brain's white matter (WM) connections. Tractometry is an
advanced tractography analysis technique for along-tract profiling to
investigate the morphology and microstructural properties along the fiber
tracts. Tractometry has become an essential tool for studying local along-tract
differences between different populations (e.g., health vs disease). In this
study, we propose a novel atlas-guided fine-scale tractometry method, namely
AGFS-Tractometry, that leverages tract spatial information and permutation
testing to enhance the along-tract statistical analysis between populations.
There are two major contributions in AGFS-Tractometry. First, we create a novel
atlas-guided tract profiling template that enables consistent, fine-scale,
along-tract parcellation of subject-specific fiber tracts. Second, we propose a
novel nonparametric permutation testing group comparison method to enable
simultaneous analysis across all along-tract parcels while correcting for
multiple comparisons. We perform experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets
with known group differences and in vivo real data. We compare AGFS-Tractometry
with two state-of-the-art tractometry methods, including Automated Fiber-tract
Quantification (AFQ) and BUndle ANalytics (BUAN). Our results show that the
proposed AGFS-Tractometry obtains enhanced sensitivity and specificity in
detecting local WM differences. In the real data analysis experiments,
AGFS-Tractometry can identify more regions with significant differences, which
are anatomically consistent with the existing literature. Overall, these
demonstrate the ability of AGFS-Tractometry to detect subtle or spatially
localized WM group-level differences. The created tract profiling template and
related code are available at:

TL;DR: Elevate3D是一个新框架，将低质量3D资产提升为高质量，通过HFS-SDEdit方法增强纹理并结合几何优化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量3D资产稀缺且获取成本高，Elevate3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用HFS-SDEdit增强纹理，结合单目几何预测器优化几何，交替进行纹理和几何细化。

Result: Elevate3D在3D模型细化中达到最先进质量，有效缓解高质量开源3D资产短缺问题。

Conclusion: Elevate3D通过纹理和几何联合优化，显著提升了3D资产质量，填补了市场空白。

Abstract: High-quality 3D assets are essential for various applications in computer
graphics and 3D vision but remain scarce due to significant acquisition costs.
To address this shortage, we introduce Elevate3D, a novel framework that
transforms readily accessible low-quality 3D assets into higher quality. At the
core of Elevate3D is HFS-SDEdit, a specialized texture enhancement method that
significantly improves texture quality while preserving the appearance and
geometry while fixing its degradations. Furthermore, Elevate3D operates in a
view-by-view manner, alternating between texture and geometry refinement.
Unlike previous methods that have largely overlooked geometry refinement, our
framework leverages geometric cues from images refined with HFS-SDEdit by
employing state-of-the-art monocular geometry predictors. This approach ensures
detailed and accurate geometry that aligns seamlessly with the enhanced
texture. Elevate3D outperforms recent competitors by achieving state-of-the-art
quality in 3D model refinement, effectively addressing the scarcity of
high-quality open-source 3D assets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DRL在动态网络决策中因依赖结构化数据和固定规则导致的适应性和响应性不足问题。

Method: 结合LiLM与RDB，利用BART和FLAN-T5解析网络数据，支持多样查询类型。

Result: FLAN-T5在测试损失（0.00161）、准确率（94.79%）和处理时间（2h 2min）上优于BART和SQLCoder。

Conclusion: LiLM-RDB-SFC方法显著提升SFC管理效率，FLAN-T5是更优的语言模型选择。

Abstract: Effective management of Service Function Chains (SFCs) and optimal Virtual
Network Function (VNF) placement are critical challenges in modern
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
environments. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely adopted for
dynamic network decision-making, its inherent dependency on structured data and
fixed action rules often limits adaptability and responsiveness, particularly
under unpredictable network conditions. This paper introduces LiLM-RDB-SFC, a
novel approach combining Lightweight Language Model (LiLM) with Relational
Database (RDB) to answer network state queries to guide DRL model for efficient
SFC provisioning. Our proposed approach leverages two LiLMs, Bidirectional and
Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and the Fine-tuned Language Net T5
(FLAN-T5), to interpret network data and support diverse query types related to
SFC demands, data center resources, and VNF availability. Results demonstrate
that FLAN-T5 outperforms BART with a lower test loss (0.00161 compared to
0.00734), higher accuracy (94.79% compared to 80.2%), and less processing time
(2h 2min compared to 2h 38min). Moreover, when compared to the large language
model SQLCoder, FLAN-T5 matches the accuracy of SQLCoder while cutting
processing time by 96% (SQLCoder: 54 h 43 min; FLAN-T5: 2 h 2 min).
