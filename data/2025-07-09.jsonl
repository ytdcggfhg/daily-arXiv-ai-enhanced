However, existing LLM-based\nmethods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes\nand design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout\ngeneration. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that\nleverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent\nlayouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we\nenhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such\nas region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing\nthe layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling\nthe generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined\nrelationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines\nlayout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct\nlayout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that\narise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive\nexperimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can\ngenerate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human\naesthetics and more explainable."}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our\ndataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater\nperformance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance\ncomparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data\nquantity and diversity.

While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these\nintroduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We\nintroduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a\nnew Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six\nlanguages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is\ntrained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and\nhigh-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two\nEnglish-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.\nNeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining\nstrong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.\nNotably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while\noutperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though\nthese models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending\ncrosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously\nassess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,\nNeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We\nrelease an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated\ndataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual\nevaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates\nthat multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved\nrobustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI."}

Existing\ndeep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,\noverlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent\nadvances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a\npowerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new\nopportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce\nLangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages\nVLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).\nLangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a\nLanguage-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT\nimages into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our\nfindings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to\nadvance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba."}

Its key innovation lies\nin effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily\nstems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively\nactivates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for\nadditional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover\nthe fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal\nalignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique\nindicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,\nwhich has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.\nSkywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving\nfrom 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.\nRemarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B\nparameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation\nsuccessfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related\nreasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and\nreinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on\nmultimodal reasoning.
