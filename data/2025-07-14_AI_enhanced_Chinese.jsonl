First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model\nforms \"features\" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the\nconnections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,\nstate-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual\nconnections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.\nThird, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a\ncollection of memorized facts and discovers a \"circuit\" that connects these\nfacts. However, we conclude by exploring the \"parallel mechanisms\" phenomenon,\narguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive\narchitecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from\nwhether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218LLMs\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5c42\u673a\u5668\u7406\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\uff1a\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8LLMs\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e89\u8bba\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Their\npotential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant\nresearch on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal\nLLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially\nwhen compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to\ninsufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper\naims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image\nmodels, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a\nnovel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating\nimages that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text\nprompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable\nDiffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and\nStable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro\n1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions\ngenerated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used\nto generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the\nText-to-Image models.

We find strong and consistent\nprioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,\nacross most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping\nfactors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical\ndiscourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between\npolitical \"bias\" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against\nconflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals\nthat fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through\nboth self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this \"liberal tilt\" is\nnot a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an\nemergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,\nwe propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance\nphilosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal\nidentity or interest.

To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a\n3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse\nviews.

It includes two tasks:\nAuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a\nmethod section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps\nreviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.\nFor both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic\nevaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks\nremain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of\nthe original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of\ncurrent LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting\noutperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "AblationBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff1aAuthorAblation\u548cReviewerAblation\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u8bc6\u522b29%\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAblationBench\u57fa\u51c6\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u8bc6\u522b29%\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of\nconvolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through\nconsecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and\nmemory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer\nlayers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For\ntransformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head\nattention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is\ncomputationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size\nreduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.\nNevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise\ntraining or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on\nhigher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the\nresolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by\nlearnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator\nwhich has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier\ntransform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the\nfrequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,\nfast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the\nBraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS\nshowed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model\nparameters.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Krul\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u56e0\u5ffd\u7565\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9884\u5224\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u5f02\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3001\u65e0\u6c14\u6ce1\u6062\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "TTFT\u51cf\u5c111.5x-2.68x\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c111.33x-2.35x\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Krul\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA\nmodule is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and\nachieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module\nis proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure\nadjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the\ndetection model in the target domain.

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing.

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model.

Low-light enhancement improves\nimage quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or\ngeometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual\nquality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,\nconstrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain\nadaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a\ngeneralized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,\nwhich we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm\nimproves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of\nlow-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to\noptimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance.

Such a\nformulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures\nor task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration\nby endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented\ngeneralization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a\nrobust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and\npropose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features\nfrom Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view\nmatching capabilities.

However, it faces two significant\nchallenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen\ninstances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)\nprevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the\nfinal output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits\ntheir capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal\nembedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance\nConditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt\ngeneration. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as\nconditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts\n(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for\nimage instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the\nmulti-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention\nMutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and\nsemantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual\nConditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal\ntasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that\nintegrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination\namong the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and\ninstance-specific knowledge.

In tax consulting\npractice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime\ncandidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of\ntax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and\nwell-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a\nconsiderable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for\nenhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and\nreal-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the\nbest configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to\nsupport tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial\nanalyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to\nthe sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when\nproperly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and\nprovide legally grounded justifications for decisions.

To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage\nnoise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying\nresolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving\nimage quality by achieving up to 7.0$\\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\\times$\non Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation.

We\nsuggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription\ntask from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to\ndesign structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned\nend-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer\narchitecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments\nwith progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape\ndrawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias\nfor unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful\nend-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently\ninterlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of\ndocument recognition systems for document types that are less well understood\nthan standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of\nfuture document foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6587\u6863\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u4e3a\u8f6c\u5f55\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u6863\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89c6\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6587\u6863\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6587\u6863\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5b9a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8bb0\u5f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u4e50\u8c31\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u56fe\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u56fe\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8f6c\u5f55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u6863\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6587\u6863\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,\napplying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using\nholistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion\nscenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from\nholistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided\nFeature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),\nwhich simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student\ndistillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion\npatterns into feature representation while transferring the purified\ndiscriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch\nthrough reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware\nVision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern\nembeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding\nocclusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature\nErasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent\nis employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that\ncontain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and\nsubstitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature\ncontamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.\nAfterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch\neffectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust\nrepresentation regardless of the interference of occlusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "OGFR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u6c61\u67d3\uff0cOGFR\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5Vision Transformer\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u64e6\u9664\u51c0\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u66ff\u6362\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "OGFR\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u906e\u6321\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "OGFR\u901a\u8fc7\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

It involves the automatic identification and extraction of\nargumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of\nrelationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,\nthe field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and\nextracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep\nlearning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the\nquality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the\noperation of these models in publicly available argument classification\ndatabases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse\ndatasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,\nLlama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the\nChain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms\nthe others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models\nincorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its\nsuperiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still\nmake errors.

Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits\nvolumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ\na promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image\nembeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same\ntumor via contrastive learning.

The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification.

Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods\nare typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect\ntemporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache\nrestricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;\nentropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening\nerror accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving\ninputs. We formalize this practical problem as \\textit{Continual-Temporal\nTest-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over\ntime. To address it, we propose \\textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation\nframework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically\naligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates\nclass-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,\nadaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis\ntesting, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis\n(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of\nnormalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.\nWe establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving\ndatasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.\nExtensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining\nefficiency.

However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of\nan autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited\nwhen combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to\ndynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,\nwhich combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This\nstructure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal\nmemory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time\nto maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion\nNetwork (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion\nfeatures from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV\nfeatures with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal\nfeature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which\ncaptures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments\nconducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves\nsignificant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.\nOnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording\nstate-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.", "AI": {"tldr": "OnlineBEV\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f3D\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MBFNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5e27BEV\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u7ed3\u5408BEV\u7279\u5f81\uff0cMBFNet\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Temporal Consistency Learning Loss\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523063.9% NDS\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5SOLOFusion\u3002", "conclusion": "OnlineBEV\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f8\u673a3D\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, 7T scanners are costly,\nscarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.\nWe propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize\n7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using\n10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter\nResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter\nResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T\n(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus\nwas superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T\nincreased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely\non 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We\npropose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T\nand 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.\nOur approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical\nworkflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff087T-Restormer\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e38\u89c41.5T\u62163T T1\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u62107T\u8d28\u91cf\u7684T1\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e867T MRI\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "7T MRI\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u62107T\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528141\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0832,128\u5207\u7247\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u57281.5T\u548c3T\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eResViT\u548cResShift\u3002", "result": "7T-Restormer\u57281.5T\u548c3T\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cPSNR\u548cSSIM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0cNMSE\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece1.5T\u548c3T\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u62107T\u8d28\u91cf\u7684T1\u56fe\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f7T MRI\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u6613\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

These\nstrengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),\nwhere diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer\nnaturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents\nunique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and\nambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in\nlow-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on\nintra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment\nand semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a\nunified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive\nlearning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically\nfor multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic\ndisentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally\nsimilar and spatially complex classes.

However, the non-differentiable and\ninflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each\ntoken activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures\nexhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple\nconsecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity\npattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,\nend-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques\n(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nMoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment\ntechniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and\nRMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both\ntoken-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training\nobjectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,\nwe implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and\nspeculative decoding for the first time.

However, existing deep learning-based methods face two\nmajor challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,\nwhich limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity\nhierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in\npractice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused\nby sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop\nclassification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of\nLCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose\nHieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables\nmulti-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU\nmodels to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies.

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal\ntube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to\navoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

Additionally, we replace the VLM from the\n'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)\na GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining\na $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over\nexisting unsupervised image-captioning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLoGIC\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6e38\u620fLoGIC\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u2018\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u2019\u548c\u2018\u503e\u542c\u8005\u2019\u4e24\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u91c7\u7528GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLMs\u548cLLMs\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cLoGIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8646 BLEU\u5206\u6570\uff08\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad82\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7248\u672c\u4e5f\u8fbe\u523031 BLEU\u5206\u6570\uff08\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad810\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGIC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Although\ntraining using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual\ndomain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.\nGaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new\ndirections for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this\npaper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot\nhandovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or\nreal-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot\nHandover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view\nGaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate\nrobot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera\nmounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in\nthe reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.\nWe train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects\nand {\\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment.
