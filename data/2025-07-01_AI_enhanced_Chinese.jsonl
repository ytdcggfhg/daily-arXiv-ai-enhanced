For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual).

Compared\nto classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine\nlength errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while\nmaintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,\ninterpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable\ndeployment via UAVs and mobile platforms.

A common limitation in\nexisting vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are\ntypically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world\nscenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack\nof ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively\nevaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related\nto counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest\ndetection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting\nresult-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality\nassessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity\nassessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image\nacquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.\nNotably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis\nmethod to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity\nassessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for\npest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information\nrelated to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into\na regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting\nconfidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to\ncomprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and\nquantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting\nconfidence through a model.

We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,\nview counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and\nhighlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.\nThis work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future\nresearch on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and\nother low-moderation social platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5fb7\u8bedTelegram\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6Misinfo-TeleGraph\uff0c\u5305\u542b500\u4e07\u6761\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cGraphSAGE+LSTM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "Telegram\u7b49\u4f4e\u76d1\u7ba1\u5e73\u53f0\u6210\u4e3a\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6e20\u9053\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6d88\u606f\u3001\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528M3\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u548cGNN\u3002", "result": "GraphSAGE+LSTM\u5728MCC\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5fb7\u8bedTelegram\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU).

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

This study pioneers the use of generative\ndiffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal\ninfrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation\nImager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we\ndeveloped a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called\nReflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\\mu\\mathrm{m},\n0.65~\\mu\\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\\mu\\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance\nretrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only\nsignificantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides\nuncertainty estimation.

We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL\nintervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are\ninfluenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., \"a\nStanford professor thinks the answer is A\"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently\ntrain models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which\nincorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack\nby exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models\nexploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained\nmodel's responses consist of undetected reward hacks.

Existing approaches often fail\n(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic\nalignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene\ncomposition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an\nN-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and\nplacement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,\n(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate\nshadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over\nbackground layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework\ninclude object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting\nconsistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while\nmitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of\n240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered\nsynthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object\nrelationships.

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video\nobject detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.\nFirst, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,\nwe can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with\ndiverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in\nthe training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all\npossible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual\nproblems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing\nduring inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as\nfully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating\nimage-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video\nobject, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale\neffortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the\nlength of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even\ngeneralizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire\nvideo. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector\non several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with\nstrong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources.

However, transferring\nthis success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale\nbiomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and\nfragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the\ndevelopment of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained\nfrom scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical\nfoundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.\nRather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge\nfrom nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP\nmodels, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our\ntwo-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9\nmillion biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by\nfeature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from\nteacher models.

However,\nexisting approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or\ntransformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships\ninherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial\nand temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce\nBrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate\nlong-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in\ntwo stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning\nmechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally\nefficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to\nmodel global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the\nMamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,\nUKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and\nregression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing\nmethods by a significant margin.

We\npropose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in\nembodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on\nrich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,\ncovering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework\nsupports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides\nmultimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person\nperspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person\nevaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records\nafter a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for\na more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the\nsubjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We\nconstructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective\nvideos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated\nmultiple-choice questions (three options).

In this paper, we present a method to solve\nthese two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single\narticulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point\nclouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.\nInstead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the\nobject surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the\nobject undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using\nmeasurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods\nthat rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an\nalternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we\nrepresent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D\nGaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,\ntranslations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our\nrepresentation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences\nbetween the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of\neach point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned\nGaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our\nmethod outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point\ncorrespondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate\nreal-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further\ndemonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to\nexisting approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are\ncompletely occluded in some time-steps.

To\ngenerate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep\nlearning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that\nlearns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial\nattribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset\nfor colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121\nlarge-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute\ncomplexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve\nthe quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU\nframework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a\ngeometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the\nlatter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood\ncorrelations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute\nup-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation\n(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate\ncoarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement\nmodule is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce\nhigh-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and\ngeometry patterns.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer).

Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure.

This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a\nnovel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by\ngenerating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent\ncodes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance\nassociated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In\ncontrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire\nradiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial\nsemantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network\ncomprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic\nradiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible\nfor predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial\nsettings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The\nappearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent\ncodes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced\ncontrol.

Furthermore, we define collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)\nsegmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its\ncollaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In\naddition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to\ndynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the\nreliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including\nself-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and\nspontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and\nmorphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids.

In VPT, we uncover\n``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch\nembeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's\nself-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key\nand query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,\nrespectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for\nlearning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,\nde-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before\nlearning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch\nembeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt\nto be learned in a bilinear manner.

These findings challenge the validity\nof current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the\nneed for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing\ninference from available information, rather than as static output selection.\nWe release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and\ndiagnostic assessments of model reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08SocialIQa\u3001FauxPas-EAI\u548cToMi\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cdLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u8bc4\u5206\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u6ce8\u91cd\u8f93\u51fa\u5f62\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u5f80\u5f80\u6e90\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u7528\u8bcd\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u79cdLLM\uff08GPT-3\u3001GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-4\u3001GPT-o1\u548cLLaMA 3.1\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u9879\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u63aa\u8f9e\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7b54\u6848\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u53ef\u80fd\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u5bf9\u683c\u5f0f\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A\nnatural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity\nto reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted\ntwo-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency\ntoward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of\nthe combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm\nthat Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via\nRLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes\nto the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that\nDyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial\nperformance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and\neffective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.\nGitHub: https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/DyME", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDyME\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SVLMs\uff09\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u601d\u7ef4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982SFT\u548cRLVR\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u601d\u7ef4\u75d5\u8ff9\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDyME\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\uff08RLVR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u5747\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDyME\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SVLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DyME\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u589e\u5f3aSVLMs\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A Scoping Review from a Mathematics Education Perspective", "categories": ["cs.CL", "math.HO"], "comment": null, "summary": "The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question\nof how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b66\u6587\u5b57\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b66\u6587\u5b57\u9898\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff1a\u6280\u672f\u6982\u8ff0\u5bf9\u6bd4LLMs\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u5b57\u9898\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0213\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cdLLMs\u5728287\u9053\u6587\u5b57\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u8003\u8651\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u7684s-problems\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u6216\u8352\u8c2c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u638c\u63e1\u4e86\u8868\u9762\u89e3\u9898\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6587\u5b57\u9898\u73b0\u5b9e\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8bfe\u5802\u4e2d\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Specifically, we first apply wavelet\ntransform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred\nimages. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed\nseparately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency\nFeature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter\nout noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the\nlow-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)\nto aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,\nextracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies\nwith linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is\nessential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation\naccuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.\nThe source code is publicly available at https://github.com/anaanaa/FMCNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FMC-Net\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad83D CT\u548cMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u810a\u690e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u810a\u690e\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u548c\u810a\u67f1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u810a\u690e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u810a\u690e\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u635f\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\uff1a\u9ad8\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7ec6\u5316\uff08HFR\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08MG-SSM\uff09\u805a\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFMC-Net\u5728CT\u548cMRI\u810a\u690e\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FMC-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u810a\u690e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that\nGaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal\ndisentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the\ncumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal\ndiscrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous\ndynamic scene.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the\noptimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,\nperforming diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,\nlimiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these\nchallenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion\nvia latent diffusion Schr\\\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two\naspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport\nproblem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete\nshapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation.

However, the heavy\nreliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking\nundermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with\nsevere viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we\npropose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel\ntri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality\nmapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable\npairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust\ngeometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric\nConstraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary\ngeometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose\nestimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For\nmapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes\ngeometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized\nGaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust\nmechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on\nmultiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior\nRGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems.

However, existing MLLM\nbenchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating\nlong-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty\nand diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)\ninadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively\nevaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,\nchallenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring\nmulti-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple\ndifficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from\nfoundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps.

Traditionally, these models use\nsurface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with\nother geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as\nmeshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has\nexplored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are\neither insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high\ncomputational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we\nintroduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural\nBlend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike\nprior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of\nlearned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,\nsignificantly improving computational efficiency while preserving\nexpressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model\nCOAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,\nand a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact\nmodeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging\ntasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,\n(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)\nscene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections.

In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each\nleaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL\nevent attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their\nsimulations.

To systematically study this problem, we first introduce\n$\\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,\nproviding comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation.

Although existing deepfake detection\nmodels demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods\nonly provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In\ncritical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the\ncredibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the\ninterpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation\nmasks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of\nthese methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most\ncurrent deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few\ndatasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted\nforgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data\nscale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios.

Existing attempts to accelerate\nINR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level\ncontrol essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD\n(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that\nfundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first\nrapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to\nefficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then\nfrozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders\nfor individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space\nsampling.

A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS).

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups.

These challenges hinder\napplications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and\nagricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.\nIn this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image\nsuper-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet\ntransforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel\nmetadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates\nembeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,\nand temporal relationships.

However, such approaches treat\nmulti-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary\ninformation, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view\ncorrespondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose\nPGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for\nimproving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in\na two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on\npartial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple\ngeometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs\nvia pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we\nleverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation\nfoundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,\noffering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency\nmodule is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints\nand enhance spatial understanding.

Existing\napproaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn\nnew motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or\n''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve\ncomplex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the\nmodel to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the\nvisual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended\naction. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new\nmotion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic\nguidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the\ndual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and\nmotion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features\nwhile preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the\nvisual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a\npre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal\ncoherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy\nwhich \\textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported\nby the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This\nstrategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across\ndiverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark\nwith diverse motion patterns. Experimental results across both T2V and I2V\nsettings demonstrate that \\method outperforms existing baselines.

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like\nMobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base\n(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model\nCo-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)\nCo-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models\nthroughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)\nSelf-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised\nlearning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain.

Real-world data does not\nprovide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model\ngeneralization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to\nsystematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In\nthis work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge\nopen-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find\nsystematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design\ntwo automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with\nhigh diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and\nChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple\nopen-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The\nsynthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a\nchallenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages\ndataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary\nobject detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a\nstrong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on\nobject semantics.

However,\nmost existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity\nVision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across\nmodalities.

In this paper, we propose\nan efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity\nVision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a\nlightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each\nmodality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate\nmodality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the\nmodality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based\nFEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,\ncross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused\nrepresentations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target\nlocalization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking\nbenchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,\nFE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the\nproposed tracking framework.

Our model\ncomprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch\nand gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and\ncontrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure\nalignments between pathology and gene expression.

In this work,\nwe first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using\nVII as the \"condition\" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even\nrandom noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned\ncounterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts\nconditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT\nproblem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning\n(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by\nlearning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be\nused as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT\nschemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently\nimproves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with\nnegligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT\nwith our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT\napproach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art\nconditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its\nextensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model\nadaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,\nexisting approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which\noverlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in\nthe weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that\nleverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a\nmulti-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the\nwavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA\nobtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution\nanalysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while\nproviding greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA\nperforms superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,\nclassification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated\nimage quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was\nprimarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in\nlanguage tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.\nThe code is publicly available at\n\\href{GitHub}{https://github.com/moeinheidari7829/WaRA}.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6216\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "WaRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u91cd\u6784\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "WaRA\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5272\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Current approaches extract the surface through costly\npost-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or\nrequiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of\nvertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to\na surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all\ngeometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel\nGaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and\nsurface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D\nGaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the\nmesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration\ndirectly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities\noptimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical\ncontributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both\nrepresentations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying\ngeometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each\ntraining iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay\ntriangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D\nGaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric\nerosion.

Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing\nreal-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully\nsegmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant\nbiases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and\ncorrelation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models.

To this end, we\npropose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates\nHough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized\nfor instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We\nthen embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets\nconstruct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth\ndistortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis.

As a common technique for integrity\nverification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a\npotential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable\nof preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.\nHowever, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing\napplications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new\ndemands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks\nremains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,\nnecessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid\niteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making\nproactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.\nTo address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative\nimage WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key\nmodules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright\nand localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative\nquality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a\ndense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion\nsensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and\nthe tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The\nexperimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness\nand tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining\nlossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAG-WM\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08AIGC\uff09\u7684\u7248\u6743\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7be1\u6539\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08AIGC\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u521b\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7248\u6743\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u635f\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u88ab\u52a8\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "TAG-WM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u53cc\u6807\u8bb0\u8054\u5408\u91c7\u6837\uff08DMJS\uff09\u3001\u6c34\u5370\u6f5c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\uff08WLR\uff09\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u53d8\u5316\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08DVRD\uff09\u548c\u7be1\u6539\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\uff08TAD\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAG-WM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u635f\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c256\u4f4d\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TAG-WM\u4e3aAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion\nin multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior\nin both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with\ngenerated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for\nself-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we\npropose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration\nsignal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,\nincluding the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and\nDVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and\ncomputation cost while achieving higher accuracy.
