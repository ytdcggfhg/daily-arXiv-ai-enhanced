Such\ninformation includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,\nmaterial specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and\nlabor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,\nengineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable\noutputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%\nrecall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a\ncase study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports\ndownstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing\nthe practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing\ninterpretation."}

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query.

This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN\nbackbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and\ncross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables\neach region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature\ndimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN\nprovides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better\nadapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head\ncan directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only\na few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly\nimprove the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small\nimprovements.

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms.

Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the\nproper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better\nperformance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.\nMoreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/whyNLP/PCCoT."}

Their low cost and power consumption\ncharacteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning\nabilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation\nexperiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the\nreasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the\noriginal data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving\nperformance comparable to that of 8B models."}

This was\naccomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned\nCross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a\nmulti-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more\nparameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification\nwith a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic\nperformance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our\nmethod's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy.

We further measure\nthe efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed\napproaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the\nimprovements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.\nQuantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over\nthe baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by\n81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%\nand 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI\nmodel (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)\nsurpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin."}

Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves\nthe SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in\npixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive\nexperiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and\ncinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking."}

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.
