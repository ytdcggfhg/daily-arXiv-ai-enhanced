To address this, we propose\nFreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency\ndistribution of long video features during the denoising process.

Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into\nexisting video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer\nvideos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity.

Vision-based gaze estimation\nmethods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in\nimages and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away\nfrom the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of\n360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.\nThe system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an\neye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion\ndecoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate\nand reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios.

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent\ndesign, and artificial moral reasoning."}

Materials & Methods T1 and T2\nmaps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by\ntwo observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was\ntrained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower\nquartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the\nmyocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.\nDice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated\nsegmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and\nmodel-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined\noptimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual\nsegmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification\nperformance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,\nwith p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were\nsplit into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.\nSegmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer\nagreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <\n0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining\nmultiple features with ML improves disease detection."}

However, existing lidar\nand camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in\nvisually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data\nprocessing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer\na cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging\nregardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers\nfrom sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this\nwork, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph\nneural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in\ncomplex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the\nlow-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such\nresource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.\nWe evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and\nautonomous navigation, in three different environments.

Recently, diffusion models\nhave demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation\ntasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based\non diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of\nInputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in\nmulti-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation\nmask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences\nbetween the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with\nthe original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal\nMRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation\naccuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs.\nEvaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art\ndiffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an\nHD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided\ndiffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations."}

Given a language\ncommand and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential\ndemonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters\nout results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts\nobject trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the\nrobot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world\nevaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real\ndemonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also\nshow that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives\nsuch as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking\noutperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point\ntracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art\noff-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic\nmanipulation."}

Once trained, the tokenizer can be\nseamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,\nfrom short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning.

To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated\nenvironments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the\nvolume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer\non downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%\nhigher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios.
