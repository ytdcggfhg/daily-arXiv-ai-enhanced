We first developed a robust\nannotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text\nthrough iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language\nProcessing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results\nand Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts\nand 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus.

However, by building\non recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors\nhave shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from\nindependent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is\nparticularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is\nsignificant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In\nfact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques\nare ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in\nparticular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this\nissue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D\nby fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered\nradiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,\ndynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric\nstructure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the\n(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time\nrefinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing\nthe data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the\nrefinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that\nsurpass the 2D baseline by a large margin.

Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by\ntransferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our\nindicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\\%, and\nDynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\\% while maintaining high\naccuracy.

However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate\nmedical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have\nbeen equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical\nknowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and\nintegrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,\nunstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs\nto effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to\nbest surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,\neach rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical\nliterature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,\ngrounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on\nunstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an\noperationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.\nExperiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with\nMIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with\nthe same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,\nMIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to\n37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive\nmap of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to\nvisually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge.

Later, it was\npointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nand this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure\ncalled merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness\nof an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit\nas a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -\nweighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be\nused instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out.

However, their substantial\ncomputational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time\ninteractive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration\nrequirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video\ngeneration framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.\nFirstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the\nminimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,\nwhich significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a\nconsistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure\nreal-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization\nand pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference\nspeed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and\nmodel quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for\nlong-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and\nlow latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate\nclass labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,\nlistening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for\nfine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent\ncapacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nlow-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication.

Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge\ncan be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus.

Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as\nthe equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed\n\\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nachieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows\nBAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal\noverhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,\nachieving up to 56$\\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large\nlanguage models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical\nresults derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also\nprovide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains.

This paper explores\nhow Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on\ntheir role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image\nanalysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its\npotential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews\nrecent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical\napplications in complex agricultural environments.

The paper categorizes\nDA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into\nsupervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches.

MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack."}

Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images\nwith limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and\nstructural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,\ncompared to a baseline U-Net model.

A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a\nflow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and\nleverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task\ndescription. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.\nFinally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an\noptimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic\nmanipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without\nhardware-specific training."}

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release\nPuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on\nbuilding more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems."}

However, an\ninterpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and\nanalyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding\nspaces. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding\nComparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their\ndifferences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel\nmatrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of\nthe difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured\ndifferently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this\nkernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with\nthe sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this\nframework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one\nembedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results\ndemonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on\nlarge-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.
