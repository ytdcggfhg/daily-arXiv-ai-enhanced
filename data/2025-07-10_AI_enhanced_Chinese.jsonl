Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages.

For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information.

In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B.

In the domain of wildland fire science, this\nchallenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets\nwith labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data\nAugmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of\ndeep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving\nsegmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)\nidentify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization\ntechnique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined\nfire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity\nwhile preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The\neffectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical\nanalysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a\nweighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps\nelevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which\ncarries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,\nash, or background).

Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and\nvisible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB\nimages for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D\ncorrespondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the\npose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the\nintegrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard\ncluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training\nloss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the\nbackground interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware\nnetwork via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose\nprediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous\nend-to-end pose estimation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMask6D\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54082D-3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u63a9\u7801\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76eeRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76846D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u533a\u5206\u6027\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fRGB\u4fe1\u606f\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u51652D-3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u63a9\u7801\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u8c61\u805a\u7126\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Mask6D\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u805a\u7126\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although most past research has\nfocused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken\nEnglish into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's\nbecause it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating\nit into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper\nto translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset.

Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently\nfactorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static\nand foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,\ncapturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets.

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that\nleverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more\nreliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.\nExperimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Finally, the\nreconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce\nghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions.

Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse\nlabels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.\nThrough an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,\nhighlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense\nannotations are challenging to obtain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08Crag and Tail loss\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u70ed\u56fe\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08Crag and Tail loss\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9634\u6027\u6216\u9057\u6f0f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282D\u8179\u8154\u955c\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u764c\u53d8\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Preprint version", "summary": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by\nleveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions\nbetween these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of\n4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches\nper sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were\nconducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with\na fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison.

To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query.

(2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code\nbecome emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad\nsettings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains\nunclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.\n  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form\nquestions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly\nimpacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts.

Specifically, RPFNet employs a\ndual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)\nextracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby\nproviding complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module\n(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through\nfrequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)\nenhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures\nthrough bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an\nauxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's\nsensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of\nadaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively\nconstrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details\nand global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.\nExtensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which\neffectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and\nsalient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the\nhigh-level vision task.", "AI": {"tldr": "RPFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u9891\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u9891\u57df\u5377\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u65e8\u5728\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6355\u83b7\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "RPFNet\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u6b8b\u5dee\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u5757\uff08RPM\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9891\u57df\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08FDFM\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5377\u79ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u5757\uff08CPM\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u57df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u548cSSIM\u635f\u5931\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRPFNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "RPFNet\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5148\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u83b7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels.

This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway\nexploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline\nthrough benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to\nidentify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes.

However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color\nspace-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due\nto the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)\ncolor space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red\nand black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color\nspace for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV\ncolor map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism.

In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack\nframework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on\nperceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.\nSpecifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by\nleveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the\nsusceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human\nvisual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a\ngradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible\nperturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and\nmodel architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive\nattack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch\ninvisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly\nimperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several\nstate-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.", "AI": {"tldr": "IAP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "IAP\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u654f\u611f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u989c\u8272\u6052\u5e38\u6027\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "IAP\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IAP\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u907f\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,\nand most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute\ninformation. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of\nChinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute\nChinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765\ncategories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese\ncalligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on\nthe attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),\ndynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich\nmulti-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,\nincluding calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and\nevolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance\nthrough single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all\nof its subsets.

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete\npanoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation\npipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing\nstreet view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration\ncapabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing\ndatasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In\nthis paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for\nautonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data\nwith control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on\ntwo key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the\ninherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose\nthe Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama\ngeneration as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps\nbetween different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable\ngeneration of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method\n(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling\ncontrollable panoramic image generation.

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt.

The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection\nperformance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the\naxial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional\ndomain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We\npropose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.\nMethods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI\n(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)\nand apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was\ninvestigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data\nfrom an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively\nsmaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:\nCCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063\nrespectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060).

Although convolutional\nneural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway\nsegmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for\nconventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine\nairway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address\nthis issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,\nnamed TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation\nthat first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling\npositions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then\nrepresented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular\nfeature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and\nresidual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway\nstructures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two\ndatasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed\nTfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions\ncompared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest\noverall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,\nAirway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung\nfibrosis dataset(AIIB23).

Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to\nsubstantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot\nbe directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,\nUS speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body\nmicrostructure, making it tissue-dependent.

With evaluations and experiments, our system\ndemonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation\naccuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications\nfrom urban exploration to emergency response.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u7cfb\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u4e14\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7a81\u53d1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\uff1a\u65c5\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u6790\uff09\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u52a9\u624b\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u548c\u672c\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u548cRAG\u5e94\u5bf9\u884c\u7a0b\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ece\u57ce\u5e02\u63a2\u7d22\u5230\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However,\nachieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In\nthis research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed\nto optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates\nthe strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are\nEfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve\ngeneralization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture\nenhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which\nincorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly\nreduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the\nability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50\narchitecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned\nfor brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for\ntraining deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and\navoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures\nthat the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.\nExtensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate\nthat Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods\nin terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational\nefficiency.
