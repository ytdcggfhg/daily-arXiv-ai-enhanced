This capacity is necessary, for instance, to\ndistinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image\ncontaining a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language\nmodels solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,\ncontent-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are\nemployed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially\nrelevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.\nHere, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in\nVLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that\nbinding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken\ntogether, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like\nprocessing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent\nbinding failures exhibited by these models."}

In this work, we propose a\nneurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly\nfrom raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We\ninstantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that\nintegrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,\nwith a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By\nenabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component\nintroduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of\nmeaningful objects in the input.

To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities.

To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone.

In this paper, we rethink\nmultimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and\nefficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token\nconcatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a\nlightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by\ninjecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of\nlayer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states\nbased on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while\npreserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational\ncosts. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate\nthat LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also\ndramatically enhances efficiency.

This paper proposes an image fusion method based\non Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method\nparameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly\nrepresent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the\ntraditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized\nspatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,\nand multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both\nmodalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple\nloss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused\nimage and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation\ninformation of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the\nvisible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of\nINR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and\nachieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate\nqueries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing\nmethods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,\nproducing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich\ninformation without the necessity for a training dataset."}

Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

Through extensive experiments with various model\narchitectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show\nthat increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on\nhistopathology datasets.

For instance, the instruction \"Hang a mug on the mug\ntree\" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches\nto choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on\nend-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and\nlow-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to\ntheir lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks\nspecified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a\nVision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language\ninstructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable\nintermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception\nmodule to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by\nintegrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities\nin instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of\ncurrent imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and\nenvironmental variations.
