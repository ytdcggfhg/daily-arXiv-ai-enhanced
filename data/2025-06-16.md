Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个电信运营调度评估基准（TeleEval-OS），包含15个数据集和13个子任务，评估了10个开源和4个闭源大语言模型在不同场景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信运营调度任务复杂且缺乏评估基准，阻碍了大语言模型在该领域的应用潜力探索。

Method: 设计了TeleEval-OS基准，涵盖四个运营阶段和四个能力层级，采用零样本和小样本评估方法。

Result: 开源大语言模型在特定场景下表现优于闭源模型，展现了其在电信运营调度中的潜力。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS为大语言模型在电信运营调度领域的应用提供了系统评估工具，开源模型显示出显著价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

### [2] [Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11063)
*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态检索增强生成（RAG）系统中证据位置对性能的影响，发现位置偏差显著，并提出量化指标和可视化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG模型对证据顺序高度敏感，导致性能不稳定和偏见，尤其在多模态任务中。本文旨在探究位置偏差的影响。

Method: 通过文本、图像及混合模态任务的实验，引入位置敏感指数（PSI_p）和可视化框架分析注意力分配。

Result: 多模态交互加剧位置偏差，偏差随检索范围对数增长；观察到U形准确率曲线。

Conclusion: 研究为RAG中的位置感知分析提供理论基础，建议采用证据重排序或去偏策略以提高系统可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

*Alexey Tikhonov,Sergei Shteiner,Anna Bykova,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用现代大语言模型分析历史贸易语言Russenorsk的词汇，构建结构化词典并验证其构词和语法原则，同时开发翻译工具重现现代文本的Russenorsk版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Russenorsk这一独特贸易语言的词汇和语法结构，填补学术空白并验证大语言模型在历史语言分析中的应用。

Method: 基于现存文献构建结构化词典，分组同义词和词源，利用大语言模型生成假设并与学术文献对比，开发翻译工具。

Result: 验证了大语言模型生成的假设与学术文献的一致性，并成功开发出能重现Russenorsk的翻译工具。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能有效辅助历史语言分析，Russenorsk的研究为类似语言现象提供了新方法。

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于LLM的自动化管道，用于从临床笔记中提取ROS实体，结合开源和商业模型，实现低成本高效执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少临床笔记中ROS文档的负担，提供可扩展且本地部署的解决方案。

Method: 使用SecTag提取ROS部分，结合few-shot LLMs识别实体范围、状态及关联系统，测试了开源和商业模型（Mistral、Llama、Gemma、ChatGPT）。

Result: ChatGPT表现最佳（实体范围错误率28.2%，状态/系统错误率14.5%），开源模型也表现良好（范围错误率30.5-36.7%，状态/系统错误率24.3-27.3%）。

Conclusion: 该管道可扩展且适合本地部署，开源模型在资源有限环境中是商业模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在道德推理中表现出对模态表达（如“必须”或“应该”）的偏见，导致将非义务情境误判为义务。研究者提出了一种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在义务判断中的偏见，尤其是模态表达对其决策的影响，以提升模型的道德对齐性。

Method: 通过模态表达增强提示，分析LLMs在常识场景中的义务判断倾向，并提出结合少量示例和推理提示的缓解策略。

Result: LLMs在模态表达存在时，将90%以上的常识场景误判为义务，且这一倾向在不同模型和问题类型中一致。

Conclusion: 模态表达会显著影响LLMs的规范性决策，需通过策略缓解此类偏见，以确保判断的对齐性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种接口架构，旨在通过自然语言指令实现原型模型的精准控制，弥补设计师语言与建模语言之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设计师希望通过自然语言直观控制原型模型，但现有大型语言模型在此领域的潜力未完全发挥，主要因语言抽象层次、语义精度和词汇范围的不匹配。

Method: 基于快速原型设计实践的系统研究，设计了接口架构及其操作机制，并开发了自动化领域规范算法。

Result: 机器评估和跨产品设计领域的人体研究表明，该接口可作为大型语言模型的辅助模块，实现精准有效的原型控制。

Conclusion: 提出的接口架构成功弥合了设计师语言与建模语言之间的差距，为自然语言控制原型模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLAIM提出了一种近乎无需训练的方法，通过调整跨语言注意力模式来减少多语言对象幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言查询时容易产生与视觉输入不一致的幻觉，现有方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调。

Method: CLAIM通过识别语言特定的跨模态注意力头，估计语言转移向量，并在推理时干预注意力输出。

Result: 实验显示CLAIM在POPE和MME基准上平均提升13.56%和21.75%，西班牙语最高提升30%。

Conclusion: 多语言注意力差异在中间层最显著，CLAIM为多语言场景提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

### [8] [CyclicReflex: Improving Large Reasoning Models via Cyclical Reflection Token Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11077)
*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CyclicReflex的动态调整反思令牌（reflection tokens）的解码策略，以优化大型推理模型（LRMs）的测试时计算性能。通过实验验证，该方法在多个数据集上表现优于标准解码和其他最新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反思令牌在大型推理模型的多步推理中起关键作用，但过度或不足使用都会影响性能。本文旨在通过动态调整反思令牌的使用频率和位置，优化模型性能。

Method: 提出CyclicReflex策略，采用位置依赖的三角波形动态调制反思令牌的logits，类比于优化中的学习率调度。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME2024/2025和AMC2023等数据集上，CyclicReflex显著提升了不同规模模型（1.5B-8B）的性能，优于标准解码和其他方法。

Conclusion: CyclicReflex通过动态调整反思令牌的使用，有效平衡了过度反思和反思不足的问题，为大型推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at
https://github.com/OPTML-Group/CyclicReflex.

### [9] [RoE-FND: A Case-Based Reasoning Approach with Dual Verification for Fake News Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11078)
*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoE-FND框架通过结合大型语言模型和经验学习，将基于证据的假新闻检测重构为逻辑推理任务，解决了现有方法的噪声证据选择、泛化瓶颈和决策不透明等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线虚假内容的泛滥需要强大的假新闻检测系统，现有方法存在噪声证据选择、泛化能力不足和决策过程不清晰等问题，亟需改进。

Method: RoE-FND分为两个阶段：自反知识构建（通过分析历史推理错误构建知识库）和动态准则检索（从历史案例中合成任务特定推理准则），并通过双通道程序交叉检查推理。

Result: RoE-FND在三个数据集上表现出优于现有方法的泛化能力和有效性，且无需训练即可适应动态环境。

Conclusion: RoE-FND为假新闻检测提供了一种新型的基于案例推理的框架，解决了多个现有挑战，并展示了其实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

### [10] [MANBench: Is Your Multimodal Model Smarter than Human?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11080)
*Han Zhou,Qitong Xu,Yiheng Dong,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MANBench是一个双语基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多种任务中的表现，发现其在某些领域仍不及人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLMs在多模态任务中是否超越人类性能，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 开发MANBench基准测试，包含1,314个问题，涵盖九项任务，并通过人类实验与MLLMs对比。

Result: MLLMs在知识和文本-图像理解任务中表现优异，但在跨模态推理任务中表现不佳，且与人类在复杂任务中均面临挑战。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs的局限性，呼吁进一步缩小其与人类多模态能力的差距。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/micdz/MANBench.

### [11] [SAGE:Specification-Aware Grammar Extraction for Automated Test Case Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11081)
*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用开源大语言模型（LLM）从自然语言规范中生成上下文无关计数器文法（CCFG）的方法，结合少量标注示例和可验证的奖励引导强化学习，显著提升了文法有效性和测试效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言规范生成有效的通用文法是一个关键挑战，尤其是在有限监督下。CCFGs作为一种形式化方法，能够通过存储和重用计数器值来表示逻辑约束。

Method: 首先微调开源LLM进行规范到文法的翻译，然后应用组相对策略优化（GRPO）增强文法的有效性和通用性，并探索迭代反馈对修正文法错误的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE方法在文法质量和测试效果上优于17种开源和闭源LLM，文法有效性提升15.92%，测试效果提升12.34%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合LLM和强化学习，显著提升了从自然语言生成文法的能力，为竞争性编程问题的测试用例生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous
repository:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SAGE-5714

*Lionel Levine,John Santerre,Alex S. Young,T. Barry Levine,Francis Campion,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于建模临床决策过程的序列进展，通过学习预测患者诊断旅程中的下一步，显著优于随机基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖孤立的诊断分类，而PRISM将临床轨迹建模为事件序列，旨在捕捉纵向患者时间线中的复杂依赖关系。

Method: PRISM采用自定义临床词汇和自回归训练目标，将临床事件（如诊断测试、实验室结果）标记化为序列，预测下一步。

Result: 实验显示PRISM在下一标记预测任务中表现优异，生成的序列反映了真实的诊断路径和临床行为。

Conclusion: PRISM为序列化医疗建模奠定了基础，展示了生成语言模型技术在结构化医疗数据中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language
modeling techniques to structured medical event data, enabling applications in
clinical decision support, simulation, and education. PRISM establishes a
foundation for future advancements in sequence-based healthcare modeling,
bridging the gap between machine learning architectures and real-world
diagnostic reasoning.

*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate是一个多智能体辩论框架，通过LLM之间的对抗性论证自动识别和减少不安全行为，结合长期记忆模块提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性和监督风险，RedDebate通过多智能体辩论和红队测试实现自动化改进。

Method: 利用多LLM相互批判性检查，结合红队测试和长期记忆模块，系统性发现并减少不安全行为。

Result: 辩论单独减少17.7%不安全行为，结合记忆模块后减少超过23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个完全自动化结合多智能体辩论和红队测试的框架，显著提升AI安全性。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

### [14] [Two Birds with One Stone: Improving Factuality and Faithfulness of LLMs via Dynamic Interactive Subspace Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11088)
*Pengbo Wang,Chaozhuo Li,Chenxu Wang,Liwen Zheng,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SPACE框架，通过编辑共享激活子空间联合提升LLMs的事实性和忠实性，解决了现有方法独立处理幻觉类型导致的性能权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在实际部署中因事实性和忠实性幻觉问题受限，现有方法独立处理这些问题时导致性能权衡。

Method: 通过双任务特征建模建立共享子空间的几何基础，结合谱聚类和注意力头显著性评分识别并编辑这些子空间。

Result: 实验结果表明SPACE在多个基准数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: SPACE为联合缓解LLMs的事实性和忠实性幻觉提供了有效框架。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

*Shaoshi Ling,Guoli Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的无监督领域适应方法，利用未标注数据和大型语言模型（LLM）的反馈，显著提升了自动语音识别（ASR）系统在领域不匹配情况下的命名实体识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR系统在通用转录任务上表现良好，但在识别罕见命名实体和适应领域不匹配时仍有困难。LLM因其广泛的训练数据在多领域表现更优，因此被用于提升ASR性能。

Method: 通过强化学习方法，利用LLM作为奖励模型，对ASR模型的假设进行评分，并将评分作为奖励信号用于微调ASR模型。

Result: 该方法在命名实体词错误率上比传统自训练方法提升了21%。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的强化学习方法有效提升了ASR系统在领域适应和命名实体识别上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

*Jubin Abhishek Soni,Amit Anand,Rajesh Kumar Pandey,Aniket Abhishek Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCT（动态上下文调整）是一个轻量级框架，扩展了RAG（检索增强生成）以支持多轮对话和动态工具环境，无需重新训练。它通过注意力缓存、动态工具选择和上下文压缩提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统局限于静态、单轮交互，无法适应动态领域（如医疗和智能家居）的需求。

Method: DCT结合注意力缓存、LoRA检索和上下文压缩技术，动态跟踪信息并选择工具。

Result: 实验显示DCT提升计划准确性14%，减少幻觉37%，且成本显著低于GPT-4。

Conclusion: DCT能泛化到未见工具，适用于广泛的动态环境，具有可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其生成内容中的毒性、偏见等安全问题引发关注，但缺乏系统性综述。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Conclusion: 强调LLMs安全评估的重要性，提出未来研究方向以推动领域发展，确保模型安全部署。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

<details>

Motivation: 读者好奇心对文本参与度至关重要，但在NLP领域尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模和持久同调技术，分析动态语义网络的拓扑结构（连通分量、循环、空洞），将其作为信息缺口的代理特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了好奇心预测的准确性（解释偏差从30%提升至73%）。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与度关系提供了新的计算方法。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

TL;DR: 论文提出C-SEO Bench，首个评估跨任务、领域和多参与者的C-SEO方法的基准，发现当前多数C-SEO方法效果有限，传统SEO策略更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究C-SEO方法的广泛适用性和多参与者竞争场景下的有效性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖问答和产品推荐两种搜索任务，每个任务三个领域，并引入多参与者采用率的评估协议。

Result: 实验显示当前C-SEO方法效果不佳，传统SEO策略更有效；随着采用者增加，整体收益递减。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有零和性质，传统SEO策略在多参与者场景下更具优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL) 通过将上下文学习扩展到多样本设置，显著缩小了与专用微调的性能差距，同时减少了灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中等规模的LLMs可以通过少量样本上下文学习处理多任务，但其性能仍落后于专用微调。ManyICL旨在通过多样本上下文学习提升性能。

Method: 提出ManyICL方法，将上下文学习扩展到多样本设置，并通过将上下文中的每个答案作为监督训练目标来优化训练效率。

Result: ManyICL在分类、摘要、问答等任务上显著优于零/少量样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并减少了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: ManyICL是一种高效的多任务学习方法，性能接近专用微调，同时解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态稀疏注意力机制（DAM），通过自适应掩码解决传统稀疏注意力方法的静态限制，提升长序列任务中的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文理解对NLP应用至关重要，但传统Transformer的自注意力机制因二次复杂度效率低下，而现有稀疏注意力方法因静态掩码无法捕捉异质注意力模式，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图级别分配自适应掩码，无需预定义结构或微调，保持计算效率的同时捕捉异质模式。

Result: 该方法与全注意力模型高度对齐，显著降低内存和计算开销，性能损失最小，适用于大规模语言模型。

Conclusion: DAM为全注意力提供了可扩展的替代方案，支持高效部署大规模语言模型且不牺牲检索性能。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Motivation: LLMs在医疗场景中潜力巨大，但因体积过大难以在资源受限的边缘设备上实时部署。

Method: 通过测量领域特定数据的神经元显著性进行剪枝，再结合量化技术压缩模型。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和PubMedQA等医疗基准测试中表现良好，Gemma和LLaMA3模型分别压缩50%和67%，成功部署在低功耗设备上。

Conclusion: 该压缩框架有效解决了LLMs在边缘设备上的部署问题，为医疗领域提供了实时、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

TL;DR: PankRAG框架通过全局感知的分层查询解析和依赖感知的重新排序机制，解决了传统基于图的RAG方法在实体提取上的局限性，提升了检索和生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法仅依赖实体提取，容易忽略潜在关键信息，导致检索内容不相关或矛盾，增加幻觉风险。

Method: PankRAG采用分层查询解析策略和依赖感知的重新排序机制，构建多级解析路径并利用依赖结构优化检索结果。

Result: PankRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PankRAG通过结构化推理和依赖感知机制，显著提升了RAG方法的性能。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

Method: QT-Mob引入位置标记化模块学习语义丰富的紧凑标记，并结合多目标微调以增强LLMs对移动模式和位置语义的理解。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测和移动恢复任务中表现优于现有深度学习和LLM方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob不仅提升了LLMs对移动数据的解释能力，还为移动分析任务提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注LLMs的事实一致性和修辞鲁棒性，但忽略了用户对事实的表述方式（如声称正确或错误）对模型判断的影响。AssertBench 旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从FEVEROUS数据集中选取证据支持的事实，为每个事实构建两种表述（用户声称正确或错误），记录模型的同意和推理。通过分层结果隔离表述影响。

Result: AssertBench 旨在衡量LLMs在面对用户矛盾表述时是否坚持其真实性判断，而非随用户表述改变。

Conclusion: AssertBench 提供了一个新工具，用于评估LLMs在面对用户表述时的独立性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Abstract: During the workshop, we deeply discussed what CONversational Information
ACcess (CONIAC) is and its unique features, proposing a world model abstracting
it, and defined the Conversational Agents Framework for Evaluation (CAFE) for
the evaluation of CONIAC systems, consisting of six major components: 1) goals
of the system's stakeholders, 2) user tasks to be studied in the evaluation, 3)
aspects of the users carrying out the tasks, 4) evaluation criteria to be
considered, 5) evaluation methodology to be applied, and 6) measures for the
quantitative criteria chosen.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自动化审稿人在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性，发现文本操纵会扭曲其评估，并提出了应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术投稿量的增加，审稿负担加重，LLMs可能提供帮助，但其易受对抗性攻击的弱点引发可靠性问题。

Method: 研究聚焦三个问题：LLMs生成审稿的有效性、对抗性攻击对LLM审稿可靠性的影响，以及应对策略。

Result: 评估显示LLMs存在显著漏洞，文本操纵会扭曲其评估结果。

Conclusion: 需解决对抗性风险，以确保AI增强而非损害学术交流的完整性。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: KokushiMD-10是一个多模态基准测试，基于日本十项国家医疗执照考试构建，用于评估大型语言模型在医疗领域的多语言和多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多为文本、英语且集中于医学领域，无法全面评估医疗知识和多模态推理能力。

Method: 构建包含11588道真实考试题目的多模态基准测试，涵盖医学、牙科、护理等多个领域，并包含临床图像和专家注释。

Result: 测试了30多种先进LLM，包括GPT-4o等，结果显示无模型能稳定通过所有领域。

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为评估和推进多语言、多模态医疗AI提供了全面资源，凸显了医疗AI的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出MATTER，一种结合材料知识的标记化方法，解决传统方法在材料科学中的语义和结构丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标记化方法在材料科学中导致过度碎片化和语义丢失，无法保持材料概念的结构和语义完整性。

Method: MATTER结合MatDetector和重排序方法，优先合并材料概念，避免碎片化。

Result: 实验显示MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别提升4%和2%的性能。

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理的标记化策略至关重要。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Infinity-Instruct是一个高质量指令数据集，通过两阶段流程提升LLMs的基础和聊天能力，显著超越现有开源模型，甚至在某些任务上优于GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集集中在狭窄领域，限制了LLMs的泛化能力，与专有模型差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 从1亿样本中筛选740万高质量基础指令；2) 通过指令选择、进化和诊断过滤合成150万高质量聊天指令。

Result: Infinity-Instruct显著提升多个开源模型性能，InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令跟随任务上优于GPT-4-0314 8.6%。

Conclusion: 基础与聊天训练协同作用显著，为LLM全面发展提供新思路，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

TL;DR: ScIRGen是一个科学QA和检索数据集生成框架，旨在更准确地反映专业科研人员的信息需求，并创建了一个大规模的科学检索增强生成数据集ScIRGen-Geo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索和QA数据集通常处理简单问题，与真实研究需求不符，因此需要开发更贴合实际信息需求的数据集。

Method: 设计了基于学术论文的数据集导向信息提取方法，采用认知分类法生成高质量问题，并基于LLMs困惑度自动筛选合成答案。

Result: 创建了包含61k QA对的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，并发现现有方法在处理复杂问题时仍存在推理困难。

Conclusion: ScIRGen推动了支持科学社区复杂信息需求的更先进工具的发展。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用基础模型分析自发语音，以非侵入性方式检测阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆（ADRD），发现基于语音的模型（如Whisper-medium）和语言模型（如BERT）在分类认知状态方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测ADRD对及时干预至关重要，自发语音中的声学和语言标记可作为非侵入性生物标志物。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集，筛选703名健康对照、81名轻度认知障碍和405名AD患者，测试多种开源语音和语言模型的分类性能。

Result: Whisper-medium模型在语音模型中表现最佳（准确率0.731），BERT在语言模型中表现最佳（准确率0.662）。ASR生成的音频嵌入效果优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于声学的方法（尤其是ASR嵌入）在ADRD早期检测中具有可扩展、非侵入和成本效益高的潜力。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自蒸馏损失的梯度剪枝方法，专注于MLP模块剪枝，显著压缩LLM且性能无明显下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs性能强大，但其部署成本高昂。现有梯度剪枝方法忽略生成能力的关键信息。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失，利用原始模型的预测信息；专注于MLP模块剪枝。

Result: 在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，性能接近1B规模开源LLMs。

Conclusion: 该方法高效压缩LLM，性能优异，代码和权重已开源。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

TL;DR: 论文提出SUTA-LM，结合TTA和语言模型重评分，解决领域不匹配问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实领域不匹配导致ASR性能下降，TTA与语言模型结合存在干扰问题。

Method: 提出SUTA-LM，基于熵最小化的TTA方法，结合语言模型重评分，通过自动步长选择机制控制适应过程。

Result: 在18个ASR数据集上验证，SUTA-LM表现稳健。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM有效结合TTA与语言模型，提升ASR性能。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出ASRJam和EchoGuard框架，通过对抗性扰动和自然失真干扰ASR系统，防止语音钓鱼攻击，同时不影响人类通话体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音钓鱼攻击利用LLM、TTS和ASR技术规模化实施，威胁安全。ASR转录环节是攻击链中最脆弱的部分。

Method: 提出ASRJam框架，注入对抗性扰动干扰ASR；设计EchoGuard，利用自然失真（如回声）破坏ASR但人类可接受。

Result: 39人用户研究表明，EchoGuard在ASR干扰和人类通话体验上表现最佳。

Conclusion: EchoGuard是一种实用且高效的防御方案，能有效阻断语音钓鱼攻击的反馈循环。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

Conclusion: 语音指令是驱动GUI代理的有效方式，GUIRoboTron-Speech为相关研究提供了实用工具和数据。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing
human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions
imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in
hands-free scenarios. To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the
first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否随着能力的提升而趋近于人类的推理模式。

Method: 使用Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR)框架和PyETR工具包，评估38个语言模型在383个逻辑推理任务中的表现。

Result: 随着模型能力的提升，其错误答案中与ETR预测的人类误区一致的比例显著增加（ρ=0.360, p=0.0265）。

Conclusion: 语言模型的错误模式趋近于人类推理的局限性，挑战了模型规模扩大自然实现规范理性的观点。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes

Result: 在台湾普通话任务中，Twister模型比Whisper-large-v2错误率降低20%（普通话）和50%（中英混合）。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源或特定领域ASR性能提升提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

TL;DR: RETUYT-INCO团队在BEA 2025共享任务中展示了参数少于1B的小模型，尽管计算资源有限，但仍保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟全球南方研究机构因计算资源昂贵而受限的条件，证明小模型在有限资源下的可行性。

Method: 使用参数少于1B的小模型参与共享任务，测试其在低预算GPU或无GPU环境下的表现。

Result: 与优胜团队的$exact\ F_1$分数差距最小为6.46，最大为13.13，表明小模型具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 参数少于1B的小模型在有限计算资源下仍能保持竞争力，适合低预算或无GPU环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多语言表示中共享语义空间的特性，将去偏效果在语言间传递，但现有方法无法利用这一机会。

Method: 提出IMSAE，通过迭代SVD截断识别和减轻多语言的联合偏见子空间。

Result: 在八种语言和五种人口统计维度上验证了IMSAE的有效性，尤其在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: IMSAE在多种语言模型上优于传统方法，同时保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 时间表推理对大型语言模型（LLMs）至关重要，但现有提示技术的效果未充分探索，且性能因表和上下文结构差异显著。

Method: 研究多种提示技术，提出自适应框架SEAR，动态调整提示策略并结合结构化推理。

Result: SEAR在所有表类型中表现优于基线方法；表结构重构的统一表示能增强推理能力。

Conclusion: SEAR为时间表推理提供了自适应解决方案，且表结构优化有助于提升模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过学习专用的“继续思考”标记来扩展语言模型推理步骤的方法，相比固定标记方法，显著提升了数学基准测试的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过动态扩展推理步骤提升语言模型性能，特别是探索专用标记是否比固定标记更有效。

Method: 在蒸馏版DeepSeek-R1中引入单一学习标记“<|continue-thinking|>”，仅通过强化学习训练其嵌入，保持模型权重不变。

Result: 学习标记方法在GSM8K等数学基准上比基线模型和固定标记方法（如“Wait”）表现更优，提升幅度更大（4.2% vs 1.3%）。

Conclusion: 专用学习标记能更有效地触发扩展推理，显著提升模型准确性，优于固定标记方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

Motivation: 课程学习在机器学习中表现优异，但在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未充分探索，因此本文进行了系统性研究。

Method: 实验了多种课程学习设置，包括基础课程学习、基于步调的采样和交错课程，并采用六种难度指标指导。

Result: 课程学习在训练早期和中期显著提升收敛速度，作为预热策略时能带来3.5%的性能提升。压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性是最有效的难度信号。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据排序在大规模预训练中的重要性，为高效、可扩展的模型开发提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Avey的新神经网络架构，旨在解决Transformer在处理长序列时的局限性，同时避免RNN的并行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在固定上下文窗口和注意力机制二次复杂度的挑战，而RNN虽然能线性扩展序列长度但并行性受限。因此，需要一种新架构来兼顾长序列处理和高效并行计算。

Method: Avey架构由排序器和自回归神经处理器组成，动态选择并处理最相关的token，解耦序列长度与上下文宽度。

Result: 实验表明，Avey在短程NLP任务中表现与Transformer相当，且在长程依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Avey是一种突破性的架构，能够高效处理任意长度序列，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型的困惑度与对人类语言处理难度的预测能力之间的关系，尤其是扩展到脑成像数据。

Method: 使用17个预训练的Transformer模型，在三种语言家族和两个功能磁共振成像数据集上评估其预测能力。

Result: 模型困惑度与模型拟合度之间的正相关关系仍然成立，表明这一趋势适用于神经测量。

Conclusion: Transformer模型的困惑度与对人类语言处理难度的预测能力具有普遍性，不仅限于延迟测量。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Result: 实验表明，成对比较方法在识别高影响力论文上显著优于传统评分方法，但也发现新颖性降低和机构不平衡等偏见。

Conclusion: LLM在重新定义同行评审方面具有潜力，但需解决公平性和多样性等关键挑战。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Result: 基于多样化对话数据集的实验表明，文本方法（尤其是MPM）在短对话中表现优于音频方法。

Conclusion: 文本方法展示了利用语言特征的潜力，为多模态和语义特征分割研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD
systems, with superior performance in short conversational contexts. This paper
not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor

compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across

Motivation: 受人类认知发展的启发，旨在通过同步增加数据难度和模型规模，提高大型语言模型预训练的学习效率。

Method: 采用Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling (CGLS)框架，逐步堆叠模型层，并配合从简单到复杂的数据课程。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模的实验中，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等基准测试中表现优于基线方法，且零样本性能更好。

Conclusion: CGLS通过渐进式堆叠和课程设计，有效提升了模型在知识密集型和推理任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

Result: 减少80% KV缓存内存使用，解码速度提升3.19倍，端到端延迟降低2.72倍。

Conclusion: Chelsea高效且实用，适用于长上下文LLM部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在复杂代理环境中效果不佳，因为奖励稀疏导致模型训练困难。

Method: 提出Agent-RLVR框架，通过代理指导机制（如战略计划和动态反馈）引导代理完成任务，并结合RLVR更新策略。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified任务中，Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1性能从9.4%提升至22.4%，进一步优化后达到27.8%。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR为复杂环境中RLVR的应用提供了新思路，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

TL;DR: KoGEC是一个基于预训练翻译模型的韩语语法纠错系统，通过微调NLLB模型，在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效的韩语语法纠错系统，填补现有大型语言模型在韩语GEC任务中的不足。

Method: 微调NLLB模型，使用特殊语言标记区分原始和纠正句子，并通过BLEU分数和LLM评估方法进行测试。

Result: KoGEC在韩语GEC任务中表现优于GPT-4和HCX-3，尤其在标点错误纠正上更均衡。

Conclusion: KoGEC展示了任务专用模型在特定NLP任务中的潜力，为韩语GEC提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

*Harvey Yiyun Fu,Aryan Shrivastava,Jared Moore,Peter West,Chenhao Tan,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了AbsenceBench，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）检测缺失信息的能力，发现即使先进模型如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在此任务上表现不佳，揭示了Transformer注意力机制在处理信息缺失时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在处理长输入和定位特定信息方面表现出色（如NIAH测试），但它们在检测明显缺失信息时仍存在困难。

Method: 通过AbsenceBench评估LLM在三个领域（数值序列、诗歌、GitHub拉取请求）中检测缺失信息的能力，对比原始和编辑后的文档。

Result: 即使先进模型Claude-3.7-Sonnet在平均上下文长度为5K token时，F1分数仅为69.6%，表现不佳。

Conclusion: Transformer注意力机制难以处理文档中的“空白”，因为缺失信息没有对应的键可关注。研究揭示了模型在超人类任务（NIAH）和意外失败任务（AbsenceBench）之间的紧密关联。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了低资源语言机器翻译系统中人类评估者的重要性，并提出了一个招募和游戏化评估平台的设计方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于低资源语言的自动评估指标不足，人类评估者的专业知识对评估系统行为至关重要，但这类语言的数据集和评估者资源稀缺。

Method: 论文首先综述现有评估方法，然后设计了一个针对低资源语言的招募和游戏化评估平台。

Result: 提出了一个平台设计方案，旨在解决低资源语言机器翻译系统中的数据集和评估者资源短缺问题。

Conclusion: 讨论了该平台的评估挑战及其在更广泛自然语言处理研究中的潜在应用。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床决策中难以定位和纠正推理过程中的错误，而医学领域对准确诊断的需求迫切。

Method: 利用检索增强生成技术，通过临床指南和文献验证中间推理步骤，精细评估推理质量。

Result: 在五个医学QA基准和两个开放式诊断任务中表现优异，基础模型性能提升高达13.50%。

Conclusion: Med-PRM不仅显著提升模型性能，还能以即插即用方式与现有模型集成，展示了其通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

Abstract: Language models (LMs) capabilities have grown with a fast pace over the past
decade leading researchers in various disciplines, such as biomedical research,
to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural
language processing (NLP) applications. Recently however, the interest has
grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

TL;DR: 研究探讨BERT是否通过预训练编码抽象关系模式，发现仅通过微调任务才能诱导关系结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如BERT）的语义任务表现是否反映真正的概念能力，而非表面统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT内部表示，比较预训练和微调后对分类任务的表现。

Result: 预训练BERT分类准确率高，但仅微调后才能在嵌入空间中按关系类型组织概念对。

Conclusion: 行为表现不代表结构化概念理解，但适当训练可诱导关系抽象能力。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Lag-Relative Sparse Attention (LRSA)的方法，通过LagKV压缩技术减少长上下文处理的计算和内存开销，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理长上下文输入时面临计算和内存的高成本问题，现有压缩方法通常导致性能下降或无法兼容梯度优化。

Method: 采用LRSA方法，结合LagKV压缩技术，通过分块预填充和选择最相关的键值对，优化长上下文处理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLM在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答微调任务中取得更好效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法在减少计算和内存开销的同时，有效保持了模型性能，适用于长上下文后训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Motivation: 研究多模态对话系统中如何输出多种模态（如文本和图像）的响应，以提升对话系统的能力。

Method: 提出三种集成方法：基于两步法和端到端法，并比较其优缺点。引入参数共享策略以减少参数并提升性能。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端方法性能与两步法相当，参数共享策略显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 端到端方法和参数共享策略在多模态对话响应检索中表现优异，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

Motivation: 个性化对话生成需保持连贯性并与用户特质一致，现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: 利用大语言模型标注话语关系并构建对话图，使用DialogueGAT编码器捕捉隐含关系，结合新型注意力策略生成响应。

Result: 实验表明MUDI显著提升了个性化对话的质量，更接近人类对话。

Conclusion: MUDI通过结构化学习和注意力策略有效提升了个性化对话的自然性和一致性。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在多语言文本标注任务中的表现，尤其是阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语这两种类型学差异显著的语言。

Method: 引入多语言数据集MultiDiac，评估14种不同规模、可访问性和语言覆盖的LLM，并与6种专用标注模型对比；对约鲁巴语使用LoRA微调4种小型开源模型。

Result: 现成LLM在阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语上优于专用模型，但小模型易产生幻觉；微调可提升性能并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: LLM在多语言标注任务中表现优异，微调小模型可进一步优化性能。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨场景上下文如何影响人类对抽象形状的概念化和命名，以及多模态LLMs是否能捕捉人类概念化的多样性和丰富性。

Method: 构建SceneGram数据集，包含不同场景上下文中的抽象形状（tangram）的人类参考命名，并分析多模态LLMs的命名表现。

Result: 多模态LLMs未能充分反映人类概念化的多样性和丰富性。

Conclusion: 场景上下文对人类概念化有显著影响，而多模态LLMs在此方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen无需专门训练即可实现高效知识迁移和性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with

Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了基于临床笔记的CRF填充系统的发展。

Method: 提出一种半自动转换方法，将信息提取任务的数据集转化为结构化CRF，并以E3C数据集为例进行实验。

Result: 在生成的CRF数据集上，槽填充任务在零样本LLM上的表现分别为意大利语59.7%和英语67.3%，开源模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 填充CRF对当前先进的LLM仍具挑战性，研究者发布了数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent

Motivation: 研究如何更精准地移除特定信息以评估其对模型行为的影响，避免现有方法（如INLP）的副作用。

Method: 提出两种替代方法：Mean Projection (MP)和LEACE，用于在Amnesic probing中更精准地移除目标信息。

Result: MP和LEACE比INLP更精准地移除信息，减少了随机修改，提升了行为解释的可靠性。

Conclusion: MP和LEACE是Amnesic probing中更优的信息移除方法，有助于更准确地解释模型行为。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI对齐模型（如DPO）假设偏好单一且静态，限制了适应性。CPT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CPT利用合成生成的偏好数据，基于结构化、细粒度的评分标准调整模型行为，无需重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，CPT能实现细粒度控制，并建模更复杂、上下文相关的人类反馈。

Conclusion: CPT为语言模型提供了动态调整行为的能力，增强了适应性和控制性。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习（DL）中从传统64位浮点计算转向低精度格式（如FP16、BF16、8/16位整数）的趋势，并提出了适应混合精度整数（MIP）算术的高性能矩阵乘法（gemm）优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DL对计算效率和资源利用的需求增加，低精度和混合精度计算成为趋势，但传统gemm优化方法已不适应现代硬件架构。

Method: 论文提出了新的微内核设计和数据布局，以更好地利用现代ISA（x86_64、ARM、RISC-V）的混合精度向量单元和矩阵引擎。

Result: 实验表明，MIP算术在三种代表性CPU架构上比浮点实现有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 论文标志着gemm优化的新时代，适应DL推理需求，开启了矩阵乘法的“寒武纪时期”。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

### [77] [DART: Distilling Autoregressive Reasoning to Silent Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11752)
*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART提出了一种自蒸馏框架，用非自回归的Silent Thought（ST）替代自回归的Chain-of-Thought（CoT），显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归的CoT推理在计算上开销较大，限制了其在延迟敏感应用中的部署，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: DART通过两条训练路径实现：CoT路径用于传统推理，ST路径通过轻量级Reasoning Evolvement Module（REM）生成直接答案。推理时仅激活ST路径。

Result: 实验表明，DART在保持推理性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: DART是一种可行的高效推理替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了DeepResearch Bench，一个用于评估基于LLM的深度研究代理（DRA）能力的基准，包含100个博士级研究任务，并提出两种评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏系统性评估深度研究代理（DRA）能力的基准，阻碍了其发展。

Method: 提出DeepResearch Bench基准，包含100个跨领域任务，并设计两种评估方法：基于参考的自适应标准评估报告质量，以及评估引用准确性和数量的框架。

Result: 开发了开源基准和评估框架，以促进LLM代理的实用化发展。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench填补了DRA评估的空白，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文建模中受限于固定上下文窗口，长度泛化能力不足。传统方法关注输入特征，本文转向输出分布，探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 通过合成任务案例研究，提出长短期对齐概念，并设计Long-Short Misalignment指标。基于此开发正则化项，促进训练中的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，长短期对齐与长度泛化性能强相关，提出的正则化方法显著提升了模型表现。

Conclusion: 研究为长上下文建模提供了新视角和方法，验证了输出分布对齐的重要性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过零样本角色提示预测个人投票决策及欧洲群体政策立场，并验证了预测的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中表现出进步左倾偏见，研究旨在探索角色提示是否能准确预测投票行为和政策立场。

Method: 使用零样本角色提示和有限信息，分析预测的稳定性（如对反事实论点的反应、不同提示和生成方法）。

Result: 通过加权F1分数（约0.793）较好地模拟了欧洲议会议员的投票行为。

Conclusion: 角色提示能有效预测投票行为和政策立场，为LLMs在政治分析中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨多模态大语言模型在涉及抽象视觉刺激（如色块和色格）的指代消解任务中的语言能力，发现其基本语用能力仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管任务对人类来说简单，但对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的语用能力测试具有重要意义。

Method: 通过抽象视觉刺激（如色块和色格）设计指代消解任务，评估MLLMs的表现。

Result: 结果显示，MLLMs在依赖上下文的颜色描述解释等基本语用能力上仍存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 当前先进的MLLMs在基本语用能力方面仍需改进。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PPA的两阶段框架，通过后验对齐策略提升多会话个性化对话生成的连贯性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在长期对话中难以保持人物一致性和生成个性化响应的问题。

Method: PPA框架首先生成通用响应，再检索相关人物记忆并调整响应以对齐人物特征。

Result: 实验表明PPA在一致性、多样性和人物相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PPA为长期个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

<details>

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在长上下文场景下KV缓存内存需求高的问题，同时避免现有压缩方法牺牲准确性或增加计算开销的缺点。

Method: 提出FourierAttention框架，利用Transformer头维度的异质性，将长上下文不敏感的维度投影到正交傅里叶基上，并用固定长度的频谱系数近似其时间演化。还设计了FlashFourierAttention内核优化内存读写。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH任务中实现了最佳的长上下文准确性，且部署效率高。

Conclusion: FourierAttention是一种无需训练的高效方法，能显著减少内存需求并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value
(KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize
head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

Conclusion: GeistBERT为德语NLP社区提供了高性能模型，并开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

Method: 提出六维框架（清晰度、证据、情感诉求、反驳、受众适应、公平性），标注4,214个CS实例，采用多任务和依赖关系分类策略。

Result: 两种分类策略表现优异（平均F1分别为0.94和0.96），优于基线方法，并揭示了维度间的强相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为CS有效性评估提供了科学依据，分类策略的高效性验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在大语言模型（LLM）接收到近乎完美的外部反馈时，它们仍难以完全整合反馈并纠正错误答案，这种现象被称为“反馈摩擦”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在理想条件下整合外部反馈的能力，以揭示其自我改进的局限性。

Method: 设计实验环境，包括问题求解模型、基于真实答案的反馈生成器，以及二次尝试机制，评估多种任务下的表现。

Result: 即使条件理想，LLM仍表现出反馈摩擦；采样策略有所改善但未达目标性能。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLM的显著限制，排除了一些潜在原因，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易受对抗攻击，现有防御方法难以泛化到不同类型的攻击。

Method: 采用对比表示学习（CRL）框架，结合三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘，优化模型表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有基于表示工程的防御方法，提升了对抗输入级和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性，且不影响标准性能。

Conclusion: 提出的CRL框架为LLMs提供了一种有效的防御策略，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

Method: 通过分析2020至2025年间19,000多个GitHub仓库的代码，研究LLMs对命名规范、复杂度等的影响。

Result: 实验发现LLMs显著影响了代码风格，例如Python中snake_case变量名比例从47%增至51%。

Conclusion: LLMs确实影响了现实世界的编程风格，但难以精确量化其贡献。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低分辨率图像上的检测性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为图像质量不稳定的场景提供了可靠的物体检测解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了自动驾驶场景挖掘的精度和可靠性，为LLM在复杂任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official
test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro. These results underline the efficacy of the

Motivation: 传统图像分类和分割方法（如ViT和Mask R-CNN）在铁矿石颗粒分类中效果不佳，需要一种更精确的方法来识别和分析颗粒的尺寸和分布。

Result: 开发了一种能检测平滑边界对象的新方法，显著提高了尺寸测量的准确性和颗粒分布分析的精度。

Conclusion: StarDist算法为铁矿石颗粒分类和测量提供了有效的解决方案，解决了复杂环境下的挑战。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高图像分割的效率，同时不减小模型规模，适用于增强现实和机器人应用。

Result: STT在分割基准测试中表现竞争力，计算成本显著降低，可在消费硬件上实时运行。

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且实用的图像分割工具，适用于交互式应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于机器学习和深度学习的疼痛检测算法在不同性别群体中的公平性，发现所有模型均存在性别偏见，尽管ViT模型准确度最高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化疼痛检测在医疗中有重要应用，但其在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性研究不足。

Method: 使用UNBC-McMaster肩痛表情数据库，比较了传统ML（L SVM、RBF SVM）和DL方法（CNN、ViT）的性能和公平性。

Result: ViT模型准确度最高，但所有模型均表现出性别偏见，揭示了准确性与公平性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 需采用公平性感知技术以减少医疗自动化系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像中3D手部关节估计的挑战，如深度信息缺失、遮挡和复杂关节结构。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中表现优异，且对野外图像具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需相机参数的情况下，实现了与现有技术相媲美的性能。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数ContextLoss（CLoss），通过考虑关键像素掩码中的拓扑错误及其上下文，提高了图像分割的拓扑正确性，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构的拓扑（如血管、膜或道路）至关重要，拓扑错误可能严重影响导航等应用。现有方法基于关键像素掩码，但缺乏对拓扑错误上下文的全面考虑。

Method: 提出ContextLoss（CLoss），通过引入关键像素掩码中的拓扑错误上下文，增强网络对拓扑错误的关注。同时，提出了两个直观指标来验证连通性改进。

Result: 在三个公共数据集和自有的3D纳米成像数据集上验证，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复了比其他方法多44%的缺失连接。

Conclusion: CLoss通过上下文感知显著提升了拓扑正确性，代码已开源。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率特征输出需要上采样以满足下游任务的高分辨率需求，现有方法存在局限性。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块，通过空间特征变换（SFT）调制，实现高分辨率查询与低分辨率语义丰富键的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能有效恢复细粒度空间细节，并在多种下游任务中优于现有上采样方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR是一种高效且通用的特征上采样解决方案，适用于广泛的下游任务。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Conclusion: Agentic AI能自主完成计算机视觉任务规划和工具配置，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer

Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中伪标签利用不足、类别不平衡和预测不确定性被忽视的问题。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了对少数类和模糊区域的分割效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效利用不确定性，解决了半监督语义分割中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过分治策略和偏好优化，有效解决了人类视频生成中的关键挑战，为高效高质量生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D为物理AI在科学和工程中的应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a

that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Conclusion: AutoCaption有效提升评测全面性，生成数据可优化模型性能。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and

LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity

Result: 在多种医学影像模态（如放射学、眼科和病理学）中验证，测试时间扩展策略显著提高了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过无偏提示和测试时间扩展，增强了LLM生成诊断的可靠性和分类准确性。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at

Result: 实验表明，BrainMAP在计算效率上优于现有方法，且预测准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精准识别提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Method: 研究采用改进的YOLOv11模型，训练了约800张鸟瞰图像，能够识别车辆所在车道并将车辆分类为轿车和重型车辆。同时评估了无人机高度、ROI距离和车速对检测精度的影响。

Result: 改进的YOLOv11模型在测试中表现出色，平均绝对误差（MAE）为0.97 mph，均方误差（MSE）为0.94 mph²，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了车辆速度检测和分类的挑战，适用于交通监控和法规执行。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Result: 知识追踪遗忘能更灵活地满足多样化需求，并更接近人脑遗忘机制。

Conclusion: 知识追踪遗忘是基础模型机器遗忘的可行方向，具有实际需求和认知科学支持。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent

as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

Motivation: 图像生成模型的快速发展带来了滥用风险（如深度伪造、钓鱼攻击等），需要有效的真实性验证机制。传统水印技术因重标记不匹配问题难以直接适用于图像生成模型。

Method: 提出C-reweight方法，采用基于聚类的策略，将同一聚类中的标记视为等效，以减少重标记不匹配并保持图像保真度。

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可靠的图像合成设定了新标准，有效解决了重标记不匹配问题。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，主要由于跨模态交互不足和空间关系捕捉能力有限。

Method: 设计了一个四层动态双向空间塔，模拟人类格式塔视觉原理，提供结构化先验，增强模型对空间关系的感知和组织能力。

Conclusion: 动态双向空间塔显著提升了模型对空间关系的处理能力，为视觉问答任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\mymethod的偏好学习方法，通过针对幻觉发生的区域进行优化，有效减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉语言任务中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中常产生幻觉（生成输入图像中不存在的对象信息），影响模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应和目标信息的数据集，并应用偏好学习方法，专注于纠正特定目标区域的幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，\mymethod显著减少了多种视觉幻觉任务中的幻觉现象，提升了MLLMs的可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚焦相关信息，有效减少了幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的整体性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

TL;DR: Auto-Connect是一种自动绑定骨骼的新方法，通过连接保持的分词方案和拓扑感知奖励函数，显著提升骨骼结构的准确性和变形质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在预测骨骼位置时忽略连接性，导致拓扑不准确。Auto-Connect旨在通过显式保持骨骼连接性来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用连接保持的分词方案定义关节端点，结合拓扑感知奖励函数和隐式测地特征进行骨骼选择。

Result: 生成的骨骼结构更具解剖学合理性，变形效果更优。

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过整合连接性、奖励优化和测地特征，显著提升了自动绑定骨骼的质量。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

Result: FSCA在LAION-mi和COCO数据集上表现优于8种基线方法，用户级准确率达90%（仅需10个样本/用户）。

Conclusion: FSCA在现实应用中具有强大审计潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

Motivation: 音频-视觉分割（AVS）的核心挑战是跨模态对齐，现有方法未能有效结合多模态知识或解决特征空间差异问题。

Method: 提出TAViS框架，结合ImageBind和SAM2，引入文本桥接的混合提示机制和对齐监督策略。

Result: 在单源、多源、语义数据集及零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过文本桥接有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，显著提升了AVS任务的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字病理学中，癌症亚型分类需要大量专家标注，而标注资源有限。因此，研究旨在通过引入不确定性感知，优化标注过程并提升模型性能。

Method: 采用自监督对比学习模型，通过计算证据向量评估预测置信度，利用不确定性分数选择关键图像进行标注，迭代优化训练过程。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注数据有限的情况下显著提升了分类精度和效率，为数字病理学的研究和应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V2LMs的视觉语言模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆（AVs）在对抗攻击下的感知鲁棒性。相比传统深度神经网络（DNNs），V2LMs无需对抗训练即可显著提高对抗条件下的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖的深度神经网络易受攻击，传统防御方法（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且难以泛化到未见攻击。

Method: 提出V2LMs，并评估其两种部署模式：Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务）。

Result: 实验显示，DNNs在攻击下性能下降33%-46%，而V2LMs平均下降不到8%。Tandem Mode在内存效率上表现更优。

Conclusion: V2LMs为自动驾驶感知系统提供了更安全、更具鲁棒性的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频对数字安全、隐私和媒体完整性构成威胁，现有研究多关注二元检测，而模型溯源任务研究不足。

Method: FAME结合空间和时间注意力机制，捕捉不同生成模型的细微伪影，保持计算高效。

Result: 在DFDM、FaceForensics++和FakeAVCeleb数据集上，FAME在准确性和运行时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAME在现实取证和信息安全应用中具有潜在部署价值。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出环境变化检测（ECD）任务，解决传统场景变化检测（SCD）中参考图像与查询图像视角对齐不现实的问题，通过利用未筛选的大规模图像数据库和语义丰富的表示进行检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCD假设参考图像与查询图像视角完全对齐，不切实际。ECD旨在利用环境线索，更贴近实际应用场景。

Method: 提出新框架，通过多参考候选和语义聚合解决视角偏差和视野限制问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上显著优于现有方法，性能接近理想设置。

Conclusion: ECD为更实用的变化检测任务提供了新方向，代码将公开。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

Motivation: 现有方法虽表现优异，但视觉嵌入分布可能偏离预训练模型，导致误导信号。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过几何嵌入关系显著提升了无监督域适应的效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BridgeTower模型在跨模态任务中存在单模态表征利用不足、语义知识灵活性受限以及仅适用于低分辨率数据集的问题。

Method: 提出ManagerTower，在双塔VLM架构中引入Manager插件，并在多模态大语言模型（MLLM）架构中验证其有效性。

Result: ManagerTower在4项下游VL任务中表现优异，LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件和多网格算法协同作用，从深度和宽度两个维度提升视觉表征，减少语义模糊性。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台初始状态估计常因初始测量信息有限而效果不佳，易陷入局部最优。

Method: 初始阶段依赖GNSS相对距离残差，待信息充足后切换至全局GNSS测量，切换时机由Hessian矩阵奇异值变化决定。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上，该方法比传统策略更准确、鲁棒。

Conclusion: 延迟使用全局GNSS测量并结合Hessian矩阵分析，可显著提升初始化效果。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Result: 实验表明，FIMA-Q在多种视觉任务和ViT架构上显著提升了量化精度，尤其在低比特量化下表现优异。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q为视觉变换器的后训练量化提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

Conclusion: SITS-Extreme具有大规模灾害监测的潜力和适用性。

Abstract: Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, causing
significant environmental damage and loss of life. Early detection of such
events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose
SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to
detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This
approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旋转估计在计算机视觉和机器人任务中至关重要，但传统方法通常是非线性和非凸优化问题，设计复杂。本文旨在提供一种更简单且高效的方法。

Method: 将旋转估计问题重新表述为线性模型拟合问题，利用四元数球面上的大圆表示旋转运动，提出基于投票的方法。

Result: 方法在噪声和异常值下表现优异，能在0.5秒内处理大规模（10^6）和高异常值比例（99%）的问题。

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，为旋转估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

TL;DR: EyeSimVQA提出了一种基于自由能的自修复VQA框架，通过双分支结构和生物启发设计，在视频质量评估中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）中，时空动态和模型限制带来了独特挑战，现有方法在自修复机制上探索不足。

Method: 采用双分支架构（美学分支和技术分支），结合自由能自修复模块和生物启发的预测头设计。

Result: 在五个公共VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能优于或接近现有最优方法。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA不仅提升了VQA性能，还通过生物启发设计增强了可解释性。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时间推理上表现不足，限制了其在特定视频时刻的精确响应能力。

Method: 提出Temporal-aware Fuseformer，采用分层双流架构逐步捕捉时间动态并融合视觉与音频信息，结合全局残差提升计算效率。通过四阶段渐进训练范式增强多模态对齐、语义基础和时序推理能力。

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中，DaMO显著超越现有方法，尤其在需要精确时间对齐的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动编辑视觉线索的流程和VFaith-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉推理能力和视觉忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管长链思维（CoT）能提升MLLMs解决复杂问题的能力，但其有效性原因尚不明确，尤其是视觉线索提取和推理过程对性能提升的贡献难以量化。

Method: 设计了基于GPT-Image-1的自动编辑流程，通过修改关键视觉线索生成对比问答对，并构建VFaith-Bench基准，包含755个条目和人类标注的感知任务。

Result: 通过测试不同视觉细节的问题对，平均准确率反映模型的视觉推理能力，编辑前后的准确率差异揭示了推理能力与视觉感知的关系。

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench为评估MLLMs的视觉忠实性提供了工具，揭示了现有模型的推理能力与视觉感知的关联。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 通过增加数据集或图像增强方法，可能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Conclusion: OV-MAP方法无需依赖3D监督分割模型，实现了高精度的零样本3D实例分割，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

Conclusion: A²LC框架通过自动化校正和自适应平衡策略，实现了高效且高性能的标签校正，为语义分割任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

Result: DISCO在不同偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为反因果预测提供了新框架，能有效减少无关信号干扰，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在医学图像与报告的多模态自监督学习中存在负样本选择不当、局部细节忽略和低层次特征缺失等问题。

Method: 结合跨模态注意力扩展k-means聚类用于负采样，并引入跨模态掩码图像重建模块增强局部特征交互。

Result: 在五个下游数据集上的分类、检测和分割任务中，CM-CGNS在多项指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CM-CGNS能有效学习鲁棒的医学视觉表示，适用于多种识别任务。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1) 使用nn-Unet分割气道结构；2) 从气管和气道周围提取放射组学特征；3) 将特征输入SVM分类器。

Result: 任务1（分割）得分为0.8601，任务2（分类）得分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 该方法在气道影像分析中表现出较高的预测能力，为肺纤维化患者的生存评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Motivation: 探索不同模型在人类动作识别任务中的表现，并分析其性能差异的原因。

Method: 使用COCO图像数据集的三类子集，测试了从全连接网络到变换器架构的多种模型，并通过统计分析和可视化技术评估性能。

Result: ViT的测试准确率最高（90%），显著优于卷积网络（约35%）和CLIP模型（约62-64%）。SHAP和LeGrad热图显示ViT更关注动作相关区域。

Conclusion: 变换器表示具有数据效率优势，可视化技术有助于诊断模型错误，强调了可解释性在动作识别中的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Conclusion: MTabVQA为多表格视觉推理提供了重要评估工具，并展示了微调对模型性能的提升潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

Motivation: 现有方法依赖完整模态假设，无法动态平衡贡献或处理模态缺失，导致在真实临床场景中性能不佳。

Method: DMAF-Net采用动态模态感知融合模块、关系蒸馏与原型蒸馏框架，以及动态训练监控策略。

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上，DMAF-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net通过动态平衡和结构关系处理，显著提升了不完整多模态医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

Motivation: 视频超分辨率（VSR）在建模非局部依赖性和计算效率之间存在挑战，传统方法（如光流或Transformer）难以处理大位移和长序列。

Method: 提出MambaVSR框架，包含Shared Compass Construction（SCC）和Content-Aware Sequentialization（CAS）模块，动态生成空间扫描序列并聚合非局部内容。Global-Local State Space Block（GLSSB）结合窗口自注意力和SSM特征传播。

Result: 在REDS数据集上，MambaVSR比基于Transformer的方法PSNR提高0.58 dB，且参数减少55%。

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的内容感知机制和状态空间模型，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上表现优异，异常分割和分类性能突出。

Conclusion: 多模态和多模型融合有效应对异常检测的复杂挑战，为实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Conclusion: AgentSense证明了虚拟数据在解决HAR系统数据稀缺问题中的潜力，无需手动数据收集。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this

accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,
physiotherapy, and various other fitness disciplines that involve physical

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支框架和知识蒸馏，显著提升了心脏超声视频表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Result: 发现高资源语言微调损害跨语言性能，提出平衡微调策略，提升模型适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立了VLT新评估基准，为未来研究提供数据和方法支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种低成本、高效的3D物体检测解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Conclusion: SphereDrag通过结合球面几何知识，显著提升了全景图像编辑的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%
relative improvement.

Conclusion: O2Former通过改进特征对齐和方向感知能力，显著提升了SAR图像中船舶实例分割的精度。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务协同作用下，实现了几何稳健的图像合成和明确的几何预测。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Motivation: 研究旨在验证基于外观的注视估计在移动设备上的可行性，并分析关键敏感因素（如年龄、性别、视力矫正、光照条件等）对性能的影响。

Method: 采用轻量级卷积神经网络（MobileNet-V3）结合长短期记忆网络（LSTM）从灰度面部图像预测注视坐标，并通过动态视觉刺激收集51名参与者的数据，使用欧几里得距离测量准确性。

Result: 深度学习模型的平均误差为17.76毫米，略高于Tobii Pro Nano的16.53毫米。但深度学习方法对光照、视力矫正和年龄等因素更敏感，低光条件下戴眼镜者和老年人失败率更高。

Conclusion: 基于外观的方法在移动眼动追踪中具有潜力，研究结果为评估不同使用条件下的注视估计系统提供了参考框架。

Abstract: This study evaluates a smartphone-based, deep-learning eye-tracking algorithm
by comparing its performance against a commercial infrared-based eye tracker,
the Tobii Pro Nano. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of
appearance-based gaze estimation under realistic mobile usage conditions. Key
sensitivity factors, including age, gender, vision correction, lighting
conditions, device type, and head position, were systematically analysed. The
appearance-based algorithm integrates a lightweight convolutional neural
network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐机制。

Method: 使用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调整。

Result: 实验表明，视觉表征逐渐与语言表征对齐，但早期层存在不匹配，引发对当前适配器架构的质疑。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉与语言表征对齐的层级特性，并质疑现有适配器架构的优化性。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖纯语言空间推理，存在语言偏见且局限于数学或科学领域，难以处理复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并基于这些区域提供精确答案，结合视觉定位和语言推理的大规模SFT数据集VGR-SFT进行训练。

Result: VGR在多项多模态基准测试中表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升了4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉区域检测和推理，显著提升了多模态理解能力，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

*Weibing Zheng,Laurah Turner,Jess Kropczynski,Murat Ozer,Tri Nguyen,Shane Halse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge方法，结合模糊逻辑和大型语言模型（LLM），以解决医学教育中临床技能自动评估与医生主观偏好对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床沟通技能在医学教育中至关重要，但大规模练习和评估这些技能具有挑战性。现有LLM驱动的临床场景模拟虽有效，但难以提供符合医生细致判断的自动评估。

Method: 方法包括从LLM驱动的医学教育系统收集数据，基于多维模糊集进行标注，通过提示工程和监督微调（SFT）预训练的LLM。

Result: 结果显示，LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge在主要评估标准上准确率超过90%，整体准确率超过80%，实现了可解释且符合人类偏好的评估。

Conclusion: 研究表明，模糊逻辑与LLM结合可行，推动了医学教育中自动评估的发展，支持更稳健的评估实践。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

TL;DR: ChemTable是一个针对化学表格的大规模基准测试，旨在解决现有模型在化学领域多模态和领域特定复杂性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视了化学表格的多模态和领域特定复杂性，限制了多模态大语言模型在化学科学理解中的应用。

Method: 通过从文献实验部分收集真实化学表格，并标注单元格多边形、逻辑布局和领域特定标签，构建ChemTable基准测试。

Result: 模型在基本布局解析上表现尚可，但在描述性和推理性QA任务上显著落后于人类表现，开源与闭源模型之间存在明显性能差距。

Conclusion: ChemTable为化学表格理解提供了严格的基准，凸显了化学感知表理解的挑战。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Motivation: 家庭护理者因多重角色和资源有限面临心理健康挑战，亟需有效的支持工具。

Method: 采用组内实验，28名护理者与四种LLM配置互动，评估共情和治疗联盟。最佳模型结合Few-Shot、RAG和临床示例。

Result: 模型在共情和个性化支持方面表现优异，参与者认可其情感验证和策略提供能力，但评估与建议效率需平衡。

Conclusion: LLM在提供共情和定制化支持方面潜力显著，为护理者心理健康支持提供了新方向。

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This
work highlights the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and tailored
support for family caregivers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+ 是一种改进的 RAG 方法，通过显式结合应用感知推理，提升了知识密集型任务中大型语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 RAG 方法忽略了知识应用的认知步骤，导致检索到的事实与任务特定推理之间存在差距。

Method: RAG+ 构建了一个包含知识和应用示例的双重语料库，并在推理过程中联合检索两者，以支持目标导向的推理。

Result: 在数学、法律和医学领域的实验中，RAG+ 平均提升 3-5%，复杂场景下峰值提升达 7.5%。

Conclusion: RAG+ 通过将检索与可操作的应用结合，为知识集成提供了一个更认知基础的框架，推动了更可解释和强大的 LLMs 的发展。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个新的德语视觉语言模型（VLM）基准数据集，用于评估模型在结合视觉推理与学科背景知识的任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有英语基准常依赖人为困难或脱离上下文的问题，而该数据集基于真实中学课程，旨在更真实地评估VLM的多模态理解能力。

Method: 数据集包含2,000多个开放式问题，基于486张图像，覆盖数学、历史等九个领域。评估了13个先进VLM的领域准确性和对抗性问题表现。

Result: 最强模型总体准确率不足45%，在音乐、数学和对抗性问题上表现尤其差，显示流行基准与现实多模态理解存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 中学级任务是测试VLM的有意义且未被充分利用的途径，尤其在非英语环境中。数据集为未来AI系统的视觉和语言推理能力提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过优化的上下文学习策略生成可解释的房价估计，以解决房地产信息不对称问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房地产市场的全球重要性及其信息不对称问题促使研究如何利用LLMs提高透明度和可访问性。

Method: 系统评估了多种LLMs在不同国际住房数据集上的表现，比较了零样本、少样本、市场报告增强和混合提示技术。

Result: LLMs能有效利用特征变量生成有意义的估计，虽传统模型在预测准确性上更强，但LLMs更具交互性和可解释性。

Conclusion: LLMs在房地产评估中具有潜力，但需谨慎处理其局限性，如过度自信和空间推理不足。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险场景中的应用增加，其潜在的伦理问题（如人口统计偏见、问责制和隐私）日益凸显。本文旨在分析这些偏见的学习能力，并以AI自动化招聘为例进行研究。

Method: 提出了一种隐私增强框架，通过减少学习流程中的性别信息来减轻偏见行为。实验分析了数据偏见对两种不同LLM构建的系统的影响，并验证了框架的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的框架能有效防止训练系统复制数据中的偏见。

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架是减少基于Transformer系统中人口统计偏见的可行方法，为高风险场景中的伦理问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种级联LLM决策框架，通过自适应任务委派和在线学习机制，平衡预测正确性、成本及置信度，提升决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人机协作决策中预测正确性、知识成本和置信度平衡的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：延迟策略决定是否接受基础模型答案或使用更强大模型重新生成；弃权策略决定是否需要人工干预。结合在线学习机制优化决策。

Result: 在通用问答（ARC-Easy、ARC-Challenge）和医学问答（MedQA、MedMCQA）中，级联策略在多数情况下优于单模型基线，同时降低成本。

Conclusion: 级联框架有效平衡了准确性、成本和置信度，为人机协作决策提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

Motivation: 当前模式链接模型的微调方法过度优化地面真实结果，而牺牲了推理能力，原因是高质量推理样本难以获取。

Method: Schema-R1通过构建高质量推理样本小批量、监督微调冷启动初始化和基于规则的强化学习训练三个关键步骤实现。

Result: 实验结果表明，Schema-R1显著提升了模式链接模型的推理能力，过滤准确率提高了10%。

Conclusion: Schema-R1通过强化学习有效解决了模式链接中的推理能力问题，为Text-to-SQL任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

Motivation: 阅读障碍影响全球10%至20%的人口，亟需创新且易获取的诊断方法。

Method: 通过分析眼动模式（如注视时长和异常扫视），提出改进方案，并采用随机森林分类器和层次聚类方法。

Result: 随机森林分类器准确率为88.58%，层次聚类成功识别不同严重程度的阅读障碍。

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成的图像越来越逼真，其潜在滥用问题引发关注。传统监督检测方法依赖大量标注数据且泛化能力有限，因此探索零样本检测方法具有重要意义。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过任务对齐提示（如“Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts”）激发更专注的推理，显著提升检测性能。

Result: 在三个多样化数据集和16种生成模型上，zero-shot-s²方法将Macro F1分数提升了8%-29%，且在不同模型规模下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能有效激发VLMs的潜在能力，为零样本检测AI生成图像提供了一种简单、通用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在因果推理任务中表现出色，但LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 论文设计了CausalVLBench，包含因果结构推断、干预目标预测和反事实预测三个任务，并在三个因果表示学习数据集上评估了LVLMs的表现。

Result: 评估揭示了现有LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的优势和不足。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在揭示现有模型的缺陷，并推动改进LVLMs视觉因果推理能力的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

Motivation: 心理学研究表明，深度学习中传统的几何相似性模型与人类感知不符，而Tversky的特征集相似性理论更符合心理现实性，但尚未在深度学习中应用。

Method: 开发了可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，设计了Tversky投影层，替代线性投影层，并通过梯度下降进行学习。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层使准确率相对提升24.7%；在GPT-2中，困惑度降低7.5%，参数减少34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种新的相似性建模范式，兼具性能提升与可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAMIX是一种自适应混合精度delta压缩框架，通过数学推导优化比特分配，显著提升压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有delta压缩方法在高压缩比下性能不佳或依赖经验性比特分配，ADAMIX旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出混合精度压缩策略，将最优比特分配问题建模为0/1整数线性规划，最小化量化误差。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中表现优异，优于最佳基线Delta-CoMe，如AIME2024任务提升22.3%。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过数学优化比特分配，显著提升delta压缩性能，适用于高压缩比场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱补全（KGC）对下游任务至关重要，但现有区域嵌入模型常忽略实体的语义层次结构。

Method: 提出SectorE模型，将关系表示为环形扇区，实体嵌入为扇区内的点，以极坐标的模和相位捕捉推理模式和关系属性。

Result: 在FB15k-237、WN18RR和YAGO3-10数据集上，SectorE表现优异，尤其在语义建模能力上具有优势。

Conclusion: SectorE通过极坐标嵌入有效解决了语义层次结构问题，为知识图谱补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

*Pradyut Sekhsaria,Marcel Mateos Salles,Hai Huang,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时，可能因依赖虚假标记（如SSTI）导致模型决策被操控。研究发现，少量虚假标记即可显著影响模型行为，且LoRA秩的大小与模型对虚假标记的依赖程度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PEFT方法在微调过程中可能存在的灾难性失败，尤其是模型对虚假标记的过度依赖问题。

Method: 通过Seamless Spurious Token Injection（SSTI）技术，在多个模型家族（如Snowflake Arctic、Apple OpenELM、Meta LLaMA-3）和数据集（如IMDB、Financial Classification等）上测试虚假标记对模型行为的影响。

Result: 发现仅需一个虚假标记即可操控模型决策；LoRA秩的大小与模型对虚假标记的依赖程度成正比；高秩LoRA在强SSTI下能提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEFT方法需警惕虚假标记的潜在风险，高秩LoRA在特定情况下可增强模型抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BRRA的攻击框架，通过操纵RAG系统放大语言模型的偏见，并设计了防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RAG系统中的投毒攻击对模型输出质量的影响，而忽略了其对模型偏见的放大作用。

Result: 实验表明BRRA攻击能显著增强模型偏见，同时探索了有效的防御机制。

Conclusion: RAG系统中的投毒攻击会直接放大模型输出偏见，需关注RAG系统的公平性问题。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中动态融合策略（如注意力机制）的适应性减弱，模型倾向于偏好某一模态，导致动态特性失效。

Method: 提出RollingQ方法，通过旋转查询平衡注意力分配，打破自增强循环并缩小键分布差距。

Result: 在多种多模态场景下验证了RollingQ的有效性，恢复了合作动态。

Conclusion: RollingQ能增强多模态Transformer的广泛能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ICL在实践中表现良好，但其机制尚不明确，限制了对其解释、改进和可靠应用的能力。

Method: 将ICL视为隐式知识蒸馏，推导了基于Rademacher复杂性的泛化边界，并分析了提示与目标分布之间的偏差。

Result: 理论框架解释了多个实证现象，并统一了先前的梯度分析和分布分析。

Conclusion: 这是首次将推理时注意力形式化为蒸馏过程，为未来提示工程和自动演示选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

TL;DR: TreeRL是一种结合树搜索的强化学习框架，用于LLM的RL训练，通过中间监督和高效树搜索提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立链采样策略在RL训练中存在探索不足和奖励模型问题，树搜索能提供更好的探索和密集的过程奖励。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架，直接整合树搜索，引入中间监督和高效分支策略，避免单独训练奖励模型。

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务中，TreeRL表现优于传统ChainRL。

Conclusion: 树搜索在LLM的RL训练中具有潜力，TreeRL框架开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

Motivation: 观察到自监督图像预训练方法与强化学习中的价值函数学习存在相似性，希望通过强化学习框架改进无标签图像数据的特征学习。

Method: 通过构建一个动态系统，训练一个通用价值函数，代理通过改变视图或添加图像增强来转换图像。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EpicKitchens、COCO和CC12M等无标签图像数据上学习到了更好的表示。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习框架，可以有效地利用无标签图像数据进行预训练，并通过奖励函数进一步优化特征学习。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Result: 实验表明域适应在模拟任务中具有潜力，但分布偏移下神经代理模型的鲁棒性仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 域适应可提升神经代理模型的泛化能力，但在工业相关场景中仍需解决分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但针对特定领域或个性化任务的微调因内存开销大而昂贵，限制了用户使用。

Method: EMLoC利用激活感知SVD构建轻量级模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正LoRA模块。

Result: 实验表明EMLoC在多个数据集和模态上优于基线，支持在24GB GPU上微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个体用户提供了高效实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Motivation: 建立深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层之间的直接联系，以增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 训练层间SAE，计算SAE单元与fMRI信号的余弦相似度，构建体素字典，并可视化模型与视觉通路的映射。

Result: SAE单元与fMRI信号相关性高达0.76，ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$在早期层利用低级信息生成高级语义信息。

Conclusion: SAE-BrainMap为深度学习模型与人类视觉皮层提供了无下游任务的直接桥梁，提升了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: We present SAE-BrainMap, a novel framework that directly aligns deep learning
visual model representations with voxel-level fMRI responses using sparse
autoencoders (SAEs). First, we train layer-wise SAEs on model activations and
compute the correlations between SAE unit activations and cortical fMRI signals
elicited by the same natural image stimuli with cosine similarity, revealing
strong activation correspondence (maximum similarity up to 0.76). Depending on
this alignment, we construct a voxel dictionary by optimally assigning the most
similar SAE feature to each voxel, demonstrating that SAE units preserve the
functional structure of predefined regions of interest (ROIs) and exhibit
ROI-consistent selectivity. Finally, we establish fine-grained hierarchical
mapping between model layers and the human ventral visual pathway, also by
projecting voxel dictionary activations onto individual cortical surfaces, we
visualize the dynamic transformation of the visual information in deep learning
models. It is found that ViT-B/16$_{CLIP}$ tends to utilize low-level
information to generate high-level semantic information in the early layers and
reconstructs the low-dimension information later. Our results establish a
direct, downstream-task-free bridge between deep neural networks and human
visual cortex, offering new insights into model interpretability.

Conclusion: 研究表明Swin Transformer能高效学习大脑时空组织，为减少fMRI扫描时间和未来脑机接口开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural
activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Motivation: 现有视频和图像质量数据集主要研究自然视频和传统失真，而对合成内容及现代渲染失真的感知研究不足。

Method: 构建了一个包含多种高级渲染技术失真的数据集，并基于预训练的3D CNN特征空间开发了CGVQM指标。

Result: 现有全参考质量指标在这些失真上表现不佳（最大Pearson相关系数为0.78），而CGVQM显著优于现有指标。

Conclusion: CGVQM在评估渲染失真时更符合人类感知，数据集和指标已开源。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的高度量子化模糊神经网络（HQFNN），将模糊推理与量子电路结合，实现了高效、鲁棒的图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习视觉系统在噪声输入和模型解释性方面的不足，结合模糊推理的透明性和量子电路的高效性。

Method: 通过量子电路实现模糊推理流程，将图像特征映射到量子比特状态，再通过规则层和去模糊化处理，最终与经典特征融合进行分类。

Result: HQFNN在标准图像基准测试中优于经典、模糊增强和纯量子基线模型，且参数效率高，对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HQFNN为视觉任务提供了一种紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的替代方案，为未来量子模糊学习框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究了隐式神经表示（INRs）的性能，发现简单正则化网格在多数任务中表现优于INRs，但INRs在低维结构信号（如形状轮廓）中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索INRs的基本能力、隐式偏差和扩展行为，以填补对其理解的空白。

Method: 通过多样化的INRs在2D和3D信号（包括真实和合成信号）上进行实验，涵盖不同带宽和任务（如断层扫描、超分辨率和去噪）。

Result: 正则化网格在大多数任务中训练更快且质量更高，而INRs在低维结构信号中表现更优。

Conclusion: INRs在特定场景（如低维结构信号）中具有优势，未来应用应针对这些场景。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖单模态数据，无法处理多模态或缺失输入，亟需一种能整合多种先进方法的系统。

Method: ADAgent结合推理引擎、专业医疗工具和协作结果协调器，支持多模态诊断和预后任务。

Result: 实验表明，ADAgent在多模态诊断、预后及MRI和PET诊断任务中均优于现有方法，准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: ADAgent为AD分析提供了首个专用AI代理，支持多模态输入和决策，性能优越。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
disease. Early and precise diagnosis of AD is crucial for timely intervention
and treatment planning to alleviate the progressive neurodegeneration. However,
most existing methods rely on single-modality data, which contrasts with the
multifaceted approach used by medical experts. While some deep learning
approaches process multi-modal data, they are limited to specific tasks with a
small set of input modalities and cannot handle arbitrary combinations. This
highlights the need for a system that can address diverse AD-related tasks,
process multi-modal or missing input, and integrate multiple advanced methods
for improved performance. In this paper, we propose ADAgent, the first
specialized AI agent for AD analysis, built on a large language model (LLM) to
address user queries and support decision-making. ADAgent integrates a
reasoning engine, specialized medical tools, and a collaborative outcome
coordinator to facilitate multi-modal diagnosis and prognosis tasks in AD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADAgent outperforms SOTA methods,
achieving significant improvements in accuracy, including a 2.7% increase in
multi-modal diagnosis, a 0.7% improvement in multi-modal prognosis, and
enhancements in MRI and PET diagnosis tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VeTTA的新框架，用于学习树状几何数据（如3D血管网络）的向量表示，通过两个Transformer自编码器分阶段训练，显著降低GPU内存需求，并在实验中表现出优异的重建效果和拓扑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D卷积模型在处理树状几何数据时存在GPU内存需求高的问题，且难以保持拓扑结构一致性，因此需要一种更高效且精确的建模方法。

Method: 采用两个Transformer自编码器分阶段训练：第一阶段（Vessel Autoencoder）学习单个血管段的几何细节，第二阶段（Vessel Tree Autoencoder）编码整个血管网络的拓扑结构，并通过递归解码确保重建的树结构有效。

Result: 在2D合成树数据集和3D冠状动脉数据集上，VeTTA表现出更高的重建保真度、准确的拓扑保持能力以及潜在空间的真实插值效果。

Conclusion: VeTTA框架为医学影像中的树状结构提供了精确、灵活且拓扑一致的建模方法，具有显著的实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for learning vector representations of
tree-structured geometric data focusing on 3D vascular networks. Our approach
employs two sequentially trained Transformer-based autoencoders. In the first
stage, the Vessel Autoencoder captures continuous geometric details of
individual vessel segments by learning embeddings from sampled points along
each curve. In the second stage, the Vessel Tree Autoencoder encodes the
topology of the vascular network as a single vector representation, leveraging
the segment-level embeddings from the first model. A recursive decoding process
ensures that the reconstructed topology is a valid tree structure. Compared to
3D convolutional models, this proposed approach substantially lowers GPU memory
requirements, facilitating large-scale training. Experimental results on a 2D
synthetic tree dataset and a 3D coronary artery dataset demonstrate superior
reconstruction fidelity, accurate topology preservation, and realistic
interpolations in latent space. Our scalable framework, named VeTTA, offers
precise, flexible, and topologically consistent modeling of anatomical tree
structures in medical imaging.

*Yi Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffPR通过取消高频跳跃连接并引入扩散模型，有效解决了定量相位成像中的过平滑问题，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中过平滑问题导致定量相位成像（QPI）的低频偏好和细节丢失，限制了诊断效果。

Method: 提出DiffPR框架：第一阶段使用取消高频跳跃的非对称U-Net预测低频相位图；第二阶段通过扩散模型恢复高频细节。

Result: 在四个QPI数据集上，DiffPR比U-Net基线提升了PSNR（1.1 dB）和MAE（11%），图像更清晰。

Conclusion: 取消高频跳跃连接并利用扩散模型合成细节，是解决传统相位恢复网络频谱偏置的有效方法。

Abstract: Oversmoothing remains a persistent problem when applying deep learning to
off-axis quantitative phase imaging (QPI). End-to-end U-Nets favour
low-frequency content and under-represent fine, diagnostic detail. We trace
this issue to spectral bias and show that the bias is reinforced by high-level
skip connections that feed high-frequency features directly into the decoder.
Removing those deepest skips thus supervising the network only at a low
resolution significantly improves generalisation and fidelity. Building on this
insight, we introduce DiffPR, a two-stage frequency-decoupled framework. Stage
1: an asymmetric U-Net with cancelled high-frequency skips predicts a
quarter-scale phase map from the interferogram, capturing reliable
low-frequency structure while avoiding spectral bias. Stage 2: the upsampled
prediction, lightly perturbed with Gaussian noise, is refined by an
unconditional diffusion model that iteratively recovers the missing
high-frequency residuals through reverse denoising. Experiments on four QPI
datasets (B-Cell, WBC, HeLa, 3T3) show that DiffPR outperforms strong U-Net
baselines, boosting PSNR by up to 1.1 dB and reducing MAE by 11 percent, while
delivering markedly sharper membrane ridges and speckle patterns. The results
demonstrate that cancelling high-level skips and delegating detail synthesis to
a diffusion prior is an effective remedy for the spectral bias that limits
conventional phase-retrieval networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的神经网络架构，用于同时聚类、对齐和去噪冷冻电镜图像，显著降低了高噪声环境下的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在高噪声环境（如冷冻电镜投影图像）中效果有限，但数据冗余性为去噪提供了可能。

Method: 设计了一种基于Transformer的架构，结合聚类、对齐和去噪功能。

Result: 在合成数据上，相对均方误差比单图像DNN降低了45%（SNR=0.03）。

Conclusion: 该方法在高噪声环境下表现出色，为冷冻电镜图像处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

Method: FAD-Net结合频域注意力机制和级联扩散策略，利用多级自注意力机制和低频扩散模块优化分割精度。

Result: FAD-Net在分割中达到0.8717的Dice系数，狭窄检测的TPR和PPV分别为0.6140和0.6398，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAD-Net在CAD的精确诊断和治疗规划中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes
of mortality worldwide. Precise segmentation of coronary arteries from invasive
coronary angiography (ICA) is critical for effective clinical decision-making.
Objective: This study aims to propose a novel deep learning model based on
frequency-domain analysis to enhance the accuracy of coronary artery
segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA, thereby offering robust support for
the stenosis detection and treatment of CAD. Methods: We propose the
Frequency-Domain Attention-Guided Diffusion Network (FAD-Net), which integrates
a frequency-domain-based attention mechanism and a cascading diffusion strategy
to fully exploit frequency-domain information for improved segmentation
accuracy. Specifically, FAD-Net employs a Multi-Level Self-Attention (MLSA)
mechanism in the frequency domain, computing the similarity between queries and
keys across high- and low-frequency components in ICAs. Furthermore, a
Low-Frequency Diffusion Module (LFDM) is incorporated to decompose ICAs into
low- and high-frequency components via multi-level wavelet transformation.
Subsequently, it refines fine-grained arterial branches and edges by
reintegrating high-frequency details via inverse fusion, enabling continuous
enhancement of anatomical precision. Results and Conclusions: Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FAD-Net achieves a mean Dice coefficient of 0.8717
in coronary artery segmentation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art
methods. In addition, it attains a true positive rate of 0.6140 and a positive
predictive value of 0.6398 in stenosis detection, underscoring its clinical
applicability. These findings suggest that FAD-Net holds significant potential
to assist in the accurate diagnosis and treatment planning of CAD.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了预训练扩散模型在医疗影像超分辨率中的潜力，代码将开源。

Abstract: High-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging is essential for medical
diagnosis but requires increased radiation exposure, creating a critical
trade-off between image quality and patient safety. While deep learning methods
have shown promise in CT super-resolution, they face challenges with complex
degradations and limited medical training data. Meanwhile, large-scale
pre-trained diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in synthesizing fine details across various vision
tasks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework that adapts Stable
Diffusion for CT blind super-resolution. We employ a practical degradation
model to synthesize realistic low-quality images and leverage a pre-trained
vision-language model to generate corresponding descriptions. Subsequently, we
perform super-resolution using Stable Diffusion with a specialized controlling
strategy, conditioned on both low-resolution inputs and the generated text
descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential for achieving high-quality CT imaging
at reduced radiation doses. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) compressed video super-resolution (CVSR) models face
persistent challenges, including prolonged inference time, complex training
pipelines, and reliance on auxiliary information. As video frame rates continue
to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the
limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods,
which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR)
demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable
solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between
hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a
compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational
complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal
information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for
seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability
and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing,
the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time. By
addressing key bottlenecks in CVSR, our work offers a practical and efficient
pathway for advancing VSR technology. Our code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain
disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can
characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on
foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single
dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this
study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis.
It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the
original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model
consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region
features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network
model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from
thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to
effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region
associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain
network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain
disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain
network analysis research.

Conclusion: 传统边缘检测方法在医学影像生成中表现更优，领域特定的深度特征未带来显著改进。

Abstract: The adoption of neural network models in medical imaging has been constrained
by strict privacy regulations, limited data availability, high acquisition
costs, and demographic biases. Deep generative models offer a promising
solution by generating synthetic data that bypasses privacy concerns and
addresses fairness by producing samples for under-represented groups. However,
unlike natural images, medical imaging requires validation not only for
fidelity (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Score) but also for morphological and
clinical accuracy. This is particularly true for colour fundus retinal imaging,
which requires precise replication of the retinal vascular network, including
vessel topology, continuity, and thickness. In this study, we in-vestigated
whether a distance-based loss function based on deep activation layers of a
large foundational model trained on large corpus of domain data, colour fundus
imaging, offers advantages over a perceptual loss and edge-detection based loss
functions. Our extensive validation pipeline, based on both domain-free and
domain specific tasks, suggests that domain-specific deep features do not
improve autoen-coder image generation. Conversely, our findings highlight the
effectiveness of con-ventional edge detection filters in improving the
sharpness of vascular structures in synthetic samples.

Result: 模型在性能和效率上优于当前最优方法，参数更少且内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: SSIU方法通过结合数据驱动和模型驱动的优势，实现了高效且高性能的图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Major efforts in data-driven image super-resolution (SR) primarily focus on
expanding the receptive field of the model to better capture contextual
information. However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking
deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which
consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods
based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while
effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design.
Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding
(SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding
an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to
combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our
model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration
consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse
Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on
features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims
to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based
Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information
by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the
efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network. Our model
outperforms current state-of-the-art models, boasting lower parameter counts
and reduced memory consumption. Our code will be available at:

TL;DR: MindGrab是一种参数和内存高效的深度学习模型，用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离，性能优于传统方法，且资源需求显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高效且适用于任何模态的颅骨剥离模型，以解决传统方法在性能和资源需求上的不足。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构，仅使用模态无关的合成数据进行训练。

Result: 在606个多模态脑扫描数据集上，MindGrab的平均Dice得分为95.9，显著优于ROBEX和BET，与SynthStrip性能相当但参数更少。

Conclusion: MindGrab在保持高性能的同时显著降低了资源需求，适用于更广泛的硬件环境。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli

TL;DR: crossMoDA挑战赛专注于无监督跨模态分割，从ceT1 MRI迁移到T2 MRI，目标是自动化VS和耳蜗分割。挑战赛逐年演进，数据集扩大但性能趋于平稳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化VS和耳蜗分割以降低成本，并通过挑战赛推动跨模态分割技术的发展。

Method: 使用多机构数据、Koos分级和肿瘤子分割，逐年扩展数据集和任务复杂度。

Result: 数据集扩大减少了异常值，但2023年耳蜗分割性能下降。2023年获胜方法在早期数据上表现更好。

Conclusion: 尽管进展显著，仍需提升性能，未来可能需要更具挑战性的跨模态任务。

Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated
in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised
cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and
transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen
to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical
application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and
cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over
time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.
The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic
segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading
in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and
sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we
report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective
analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the
successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers
decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of
scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach
of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing
data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation
performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined
in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations
affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for
clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that
a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.

Result: 结果表明，尽管存在各向异性，wav2vec2的相似性度量仍能有效识别单词，且能捕捉语音结构并跨说话者泛化。

Conclusion: 预训练在学习丰富且不变的语音表示中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech
representations.

Result: GLAP在标准音频-文本检索任务中表现优异，显著优于现有方法，并在多语言任务中展示了先进能力。

Conclusion: GLAP是一种多功能且强大的方法，适用于多语言和多领域的音频-文本任务。

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SimPhon Speech Test-25的新型语音测试方法，通过计算模拟和优化，解决了传统听力测试在评估老年性听力损失时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试对老年性听力损失的功能影响评估不足，特别是超阈值缺陷，因此需要开发更具诊断特异性的语音感知测试。

Method: 利用自动语音识别系统模拟听力损失效果，通过多阶段计算流程设计和验证语音测试，最终优化出25对单词对。

Result: SimPhon Speech Test-25的诊断性能与标准语音可懂度指数无显著相关性，表明其能捕捉超出简单可听性的感知缺陷。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了听力测试开发的效率，并准备进行初步人体试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于音素增强的多模态融合方法（PMF-CEC），用于改进端到端语音识别（ASR）中对罕见词（尤其是同音异义词）的识别准确性。该方法在原有ED-CEC基础上，通过引入音素信息和保留概率机制，显著提升了错误检测和修正的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在处理罕见词（尤其是同音异义词）时准确性较低，且传统ED-CEC方法在错误检测中存在过度检测问题。

Method: 提出PMF-CEC方法，结合音素信息和多模态融合，并引入保留概率机制以优化错误检测。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，PMF-CEC在保持合理推理速度的同时，进一步降低了偏置词错误率，尤其在同音异义词修正上表现更优。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC在罕见词修正上优于其他上下文偏置方法，且相比基于LLM的方法具有更快的推理速度和更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决构音障碍和老年语音识别中的数据稀缺、分布不均和说话者异质性挑战，同时保护隐私。

Method: 采用参数、嵌入和损失三种正则化技术改进联邦学习。

Result: 正则化联邦学习系统显著优于基线FedAvg，WER降低0.55%（相对2.13%）。

Conclusion: 正则化联邦学习在保护隐私的同时，性能接近集中式训练。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Method: 评估了OpenSMILE和Praat两种常用语音分析工具提取的语音特征，分析其在自闭症青少年群体中的可靠性。

Result: 发现不同工具提取的特征存在显著差异，影响了模型在不同背景和人口群体中的表现。

Conclusion: 建议进行领域相关的验证，以提高机器学习模型在临床应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

Conclusion: 提示Whisper和LLMs显著提升了语音识别和阅读错误检测性能。

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers
by enabling more efficient scoring of reading exercises. However, research on

multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child

mistake detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompting
Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without

performance in Dutch child read speech, with a word error rate (WER) of 5.1%,
improving the baseline WER of 9.4%. Furthermore, it significantly improved

Conclusion: 统一框架结合LLM后处理能有效提升ASR转录质量，为半监督学习提供更可靠数据。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Result: 实验表明，系统能提前3到4秒预测车道变换，为自车提供充足反应时间。

Conclusion: 该系统填补了算法与实际部署之间的空白，提升了道路安全性。

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

Conclusion: VLT预训练和轻量级RL微调是实现鲁棒自动驾驶的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in

high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although

utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

### [240] [GaussMarker: Robust Dual-Domain Watermark for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11444)
*Kecen Li,Zhicong Huang,Xinwen Hou,Cheng Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双域扩散模型水印方法（GaussMarker），通过在空间和频域中嵌入水印，并引入可学习的高斯噪声恢复器（GNR）来增强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型生成图像的真实性提高，版权和滥用问题日益突出，现有水印方法在单域嵌入中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用双域水印嵌入（空间和频域）和可学习的GNR来优化提取的高斯噪声，提升检测鲁棒性。

Result: GaussMarker在多种图像失真和高级攻击下表现优异，召回率高且误报率低。

Conclusion: GaussMarker在扩散模型水印中实现了最先进的性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: As Diffusion Models (DM) generate increasingly realistic images, related
issues such as copyright and misuse have become a growing concern. Watermarking
is one of the promising solutions. Existing methods inject the watermark into
the single-domain of initial Gaussian noise for generation, which suffers from
unsatisfactory robustness. This paper presents the first dual-domain DM
watermarking approach using a pipelined injector to consistently embed
watermarks in both the spatial and frequency domains. To further boost
robustness against certain image manipulations and advanced attacks, we
introduce a model-independent learnable Gaussian Noise Restorer (GNR) to refine
Gaussian noise extracted from manipulated images and enhance detection
robustness by integrating the detection scores of both watermarks. GaussMarker
efficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance under eight image distortions
and four advanced attacks across three versions of Stable Diffusion with better
recall and lower false positive rates, as preferred in real applications.

### [241] [Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation -- A Systematic Analysis of the Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11022)
*Shivani Shukla,Himanshu Joshi,Romilla Syed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过LLM迭代反馈生成的代码中，安全漏洞显著增加，挑战了迭代改进提升代码安全性的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM迭代反馈对代码安全性的影响，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过控制实验，对400个代码样本进行40轮“改进”，采用四种不同的提示策略。

Result: 仅五次迭代后，关键漏洞增加37.6%，不同提示策略下漏洞模式各异。

Conclusion: 迭代LLM反馈可能引入新安全问题，需结合人工验证以减少风险。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM生成的代码可能带来抄袭、许可证违规和安全风险，开发可靠的AI生成代码检测器至关重要，但现有基准测试不足。

Method: CodeMirage通过涵盖多语言、多样化代码样本和多种LLM输出，构建了一个全面的基准测试，并评估了10种检测器。

Result: 分析揭示了当前检测器的9个关键优缺点，并提出了未来工作的挑战。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为开发鲁棒且通用的AI生成代码检测器提供了严谨的测试平台。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lean 4生态系统庞大，用户难以高效导航其库，因此需要一种工具来帮助用户快速找到所需声明。

Method: 采用混合排名策略，结合多源语义嵌入模型、BM25+关键词匹配和PageRank评分，支持网站和API访问。

Result: LeanExplore提供了高效的搜索功能，支持用户通过网站或API访问，并可集成LLM用于AI辅助研究。

Conclusion: LeanExplore有望提升Lean 4的工作流程和AI驱动的数学研究效率。

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast
libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4
declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,
data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows
and AI-driven mathematical research

### [244] [LLM-as-a-Judge for Reference-less Automatic Code Validation and Refinement for Natural Language to Bash in IT Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11237)
*Ngoc Phuoc An Vo,Brent Paulovicks,Vadim Sheinin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的自动评估方法（LLM-as-a-Judge），用于验证和改进Bash代码生成的质量，并通过双向功能匹配和逻辑表示提升评估效果。结果显示其与执行评估高度一致，且代码优化代理显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估和选择最佳模型以提高IT自动化中事件修复的代码质量，需要验证生成的代码在语法、语义和执行上的正确性。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，结合双向功能匹配和逻辑表示，进行无参考自动验证和代码优化，并以执行评估为基准验证效果。

Result: LLM-as-a-Judge与执行评估高度一致（准确率提升8%），代码优化代理进一步提升了24%的准确性。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge方法在自动代码验证和优化中表现优异，为IT自动化提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文通过LiveCodeBench Pro基准测试发现，前沿大语言模型在编程竞赛中仍存在显著局限性，尤其在算法推理和复杂案例分析上表现不佳，与人类专家差距明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估大语言模型（LLMs）在编程竞赛中是否真正超越人类专家，并揭示其局限性。

Method: 引入LiveCodeBench Pro基准，由国际竞赛奖牌得主标注问题并进行逐行分析，评估模型表现。

Result: 前沿模型在中等难度问题上的通过率为53%，在难题上为0%，且依赖工具增强而非推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在实现精度上表现良好，但在算法推理和案例分析上仍有不足，与人类专家存在显著差距。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.
