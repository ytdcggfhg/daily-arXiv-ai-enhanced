We\nevaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:\nfine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While\ntransformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on\ndocument-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops\nnotably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly\nfor rare events and complex attributes.

During training,\nthese approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which\nare merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it\nallows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to\nlow-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this\nproblem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained\nand unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model\n$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak\npredictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the\ntwo weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base\nmodel with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted\nmodel learns to exploit for improved performance.

In this work, we\nmodel the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key\ntasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),\nwhich entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse\nhigh-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a\nsingle response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and\nPS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the\no2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.\nLeveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning\nstrategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a\nmodel-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the\nproposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall\nresponse diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response\nquality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models."}

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods\ndirectly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced\nby inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency\ndetail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a\nFrequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical\nimage diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific\nmid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to\nreconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our\nfrequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image\ndifficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images.
