However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data.

However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention\nambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and\nomission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic\nselection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of\ndifferent parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a\nMulti-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL.

To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning\n(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable\nconcepts from pretrained models.

This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in\nMLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing\non the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent\nconflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and\ndirectly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and\nconstruct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this\nphenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,\nsupervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate\nthe hallucination caused by modality conflict.

To address\nthis, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)\nframework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions\nbefore committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to\ndeliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we\nincorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action\ncritique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the\nbase model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation\ntrajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two\nrepresentative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%\nimprovement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms\nstate-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAND\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u884c\u52a8\u524d\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAND\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSAND\u6bd4\u521d\u59cb\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534720%\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAND\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u5ba1\u8bae\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,\nclothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we\nexplore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a\nlightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID\nmodels. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that\nleverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI\nefficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while\ndisentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To\nachieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to\nprevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature\nspace. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color\nembeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when\nexplicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID\ndatasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for\nimage-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID\nwithout relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential\nof color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in\nCC-ReID.

Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function\nrepresentations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex\ngeometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still\nlack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle\nconfigurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential\nfor accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper\nintroduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining\nconsistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence\nloss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that\nregularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We\nevaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,\nproviding a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and\nbenchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and\ncorrespondence metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PSM\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u91cf\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PSM\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u7c92\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u90bb\u57df\u5bf9\u5e94\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7c92\u5b50\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PSM\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u5256\u5f62\u72b6\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The de facto approach to solving the\nproblem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason\nthrough the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to\ngenerate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and\ncan be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering\n(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging\nRL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance\nsignals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally\nimportant metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show\nthat: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,\ncontrary to popular claims in recent literature.

(2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help\nRAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of\nsearches at inference time.

It pioneers an innovative dual\nlens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional\nontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary\nbreakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution.

Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,\nparticularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing\nfacial structures.

In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of\ndifferentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,\nand propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to\nconventional instruction tuning.

However, we investigate alignment\nfrom a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference\noptimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking\noptimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference\nOptimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion\nmodels by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the\nsame optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to\njustify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to\nvalidate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic\nmetrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO\ncan consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically\noutperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in\nPickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's\nsuperiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs.

For each task, scientists carefully\nchoose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.\nRecent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision\nmodels on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend\nto focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For\nmany important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application\nmodalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation\nmodels makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small\ndatasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing\nfoundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on\nmulti-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing\nmechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a\nspecific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only\nretains experts specialized for the task modalities.

Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,\nis that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,\nthey often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,\nas well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against\nalternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge\nthe intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder\nthan verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.\nTaken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can\nsubstantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08IM-RM\uff09\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08EX-RM\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662fIM-RM\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9690\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08IM-RM\uff09\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08EX-RM\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790IM-RM\u4e0eEX-RM\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "IM-RM\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage\nmulti-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair\ntransfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view\ntraining data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,\na data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion\nmodel to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference\nhairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs.

This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits.

Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning\noutcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU\nloss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic\nexpression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted\non three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal\ndatasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional\narithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance\nissues in established dynamic expression datasets.

We also devise strategies to tackle label\nimbalance, or minor class problems.

Recently,\nMamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision\ntasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state\nscanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images\neffectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth\nlabels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater\nimages and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we\ndevelop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating\naccurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images.

This allows attackers to circumvent\ntraditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or\ncertified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there\nare also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human\nevaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While\nsome related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none\nprovide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified\nframework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and\ncomparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an\nopen-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted\nadversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for\ncrowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure\nimperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison\nacross 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three\ndiffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we\nfound that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it\nonly consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested\nattacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task\ntemplate to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an\nImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial\nexamples, and over 34K human ratings.

Additionally,\nwe incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,\nwhich effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides\nstronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.\nComprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG\ndatasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,\ninvolving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate\nthe superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.\nSpecifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error\n(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefrPPG\u63d0\u53d6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u5e27\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u79fb\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff08TSM\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709rPPG\u6280\u672f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u5e27\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548cTSM\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728PURE\u3001UBFC-rPPG\u548cMMPD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728MMPD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0aMAE\u4e3a7.58\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3arPPG\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT).

PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon.

In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16\ndifferent datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.\nThe code for THUNDER is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.", "AI": {"tldr": "THUNDER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u6613\u7528\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4f17\u591a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1THUNDER\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf923\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u572816\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "THUNDER\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "THUNDER\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

They are a critical tool\nin applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater\nconstruction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image\nrestoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited\ndepth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate\nunrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and\nsignificant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by\ncombining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --\nwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an\nexplicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the\neffects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a\nphysics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and\nrealistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image\ndatasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with\ndense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based\nmethods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It\nalso offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data.

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance\nAngiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,\nhowever, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,\noverlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular\nchanges. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and\nmorphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face\nchallenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and\nlack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel\nsemi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based\ntoolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with\nminimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human\nsubjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved\nsensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing\nsemi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative\nfeature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework\nutilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for\nspecific artery types.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75.

First, our\nproposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts\nfrom vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to\ngenerate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations\nof crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these\nfields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow\ncurrents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is\nquantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian\nand computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd\nsemantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on\ncrowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity\nmmWave radar.

Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves\nbalanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and\nimproves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,\nyielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCBDR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5185\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "FedCBDR\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cd\u6784\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574logits\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedCBDR\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0cTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862%-15%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCBDR\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by\nusing an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by\ndistribution shifts between the source and target.

To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach\ncalled Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the\nconcurrent handling of multiple tasks.

To address this, we created two original\ndatasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled\nmicrotubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely\nmimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset\npresents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence\nintensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning\nhas shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often\ndeclines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we\ndeveloped a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation\nResidual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by\nintegrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms\nin the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and\nquantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,\nnamely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,\nparticularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,\nwere largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We\nfurther benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and\nfound it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.\nFinally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained\nmicrotubules as well as to other curvilinear structures.
