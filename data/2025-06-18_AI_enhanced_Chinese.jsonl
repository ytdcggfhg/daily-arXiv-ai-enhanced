Natural language processing technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate base model for instruction tuning.

Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training.

For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image.

As large language models (LLMs) enter high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, governance, and law, their behavior must reliably reflect human-aligned values and safety constraints. Yet current evaluations rely heavily on behavioral proxies such as refusal rates, G-Eval scores, and toxicity classifiers, all of which have critical blind spots. Aligned models are often vulnerable to jailbreaking, stochasticity of generation, and alignment faking.\n  To address this issue, we introduce the Alignment Quality Index (AQI). This novel geometric and prompt-invariant metric empirically assesses LLM alignment by analyzing the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space. By combining measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS), Dunn Index (DI), Xie-Beni Index (XBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) across various formulations, AQI captures clustering quality to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant. AQI also serves as an early warning signal for alignment faking, offering a robust, decoding invariant tool for behavior agnostic safety auditing.\n  Additionally, we propose the LITMUS dataset to facilitate robust evaluation under these challenging conditions.

For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images.

This allow legal professionals to use such interpretations as precedents as well as laymen to better understand the legal concept. The state-of-the-art approach for retrieving the most relevant interpretations for these concepts currently depends on the ranking of sentences and the training of language models over annotated examples. That manual annotation process can be quite expensive and need to be repeated for each such concept, which prompted recent research in trying to automate this process. In this paper, we highlight the results of various experiments conducted to determine the volume, scope and even the need for manual annotation.

We assess human-AI emotional alignment across linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM features translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion categories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived emotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by the fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these emotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data on word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and language-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived solely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can be stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which provides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to systematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when conveying content.

Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines.

Vision-only methods often struggle to generalize, resulting in pixel misclassification between similar classes, poor generalization and boundary localization.

We introduce HierVL, a unified framework that bridges this gap by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture tailored for semi-supervised segmentation. HierVL features three novel components: a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator that filters and projects abstract class embeddings into multi-scale queries to suppress irrelevant classes and handle intra-class variability; a Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module that aligns semantic queries with pixel features for sharper boundaries under sparse supervision; and a Dual-Query Transformer Decoder that fuses semantic and instance-level queries to prevent instance collapse. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision-language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic grounding. HierVL establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving a +4.4% mean improvement of the intersection over the union on COCO (with 232 labeled images), +3.1% on Pascal VOC (with 92 labels), +5.9% on ADE20 (with 158 labels) and +1.8% on Cityscapes (with 100 labels), demonstrating better performance under 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets.

However, detecting and localizing unknown objects is crucial for safety-critical applications in domains such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. Recently, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a vital research direction for OD, focusing on identifying incorrect predictions typically associated with unknown objects. This paper shows that the current evaluation protocol for OOD-OD violates the assumption of non-overlapping objects with respect to the In-Distribution (ID) datasets, and obscures crucial situations such as ignoring unknown objects, potentially leading to overconfidence in deployment scenarios where truly novel objects might be encountered. To address these limitations, we manually curate, and enrich the existing benchmark by exploiting semantic similarity to create new evaluation splits categorized as $\\textit{near}$, $\\textit{far}$, and $\\textit{farther}$ from ID distributions. Additionally, we incorporate established metrics from the Open Set community, providing deeper insights into how effectively methods detect unknowns, when they ignore them, and when they mistakenly classify OOD objects as ID. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize than far ones, but are also more easily confounded with ID objects. $\\textit{Far}$ and $\\textit{farther}$ objects are harder to localize but less prone to be taken for an ID object.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dOOD-OD\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u624b\u52a8\u6574\u7406\u5e76\u4e30\u5bcc\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u7c7b\uff08near\u3001far\u3001farther\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u793e\u533a\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684OOD\u5bf9\u8c61\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0eID\u5bf9\u8c61\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1bfar\u548cfarther\u5bf9\u8c61\u66f4\u96be\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f46\u4e0d\u6613\u88ab\u8bef\u8ba4\u4e3aID\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u4e86OOD-OD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This allows free-form text control of appearance attributes like age, hair style, and glasses, and 3D geometry control of face expression and camera pose. In this setting, we assume we use a pre-trained large vision-language model (LVLM; CLIP) to generate from a smaller 2D dataset with no additional paired labels and with a pre-defined 3D morphable model (FLAME). First, we disentangle using canonicalization to a 2D reference frame from a deformable neural 3D triplane representation. But another form of entanglement arises from the significant noise in the LVLM's embedding space that describes irrelevant features.

However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning.

In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function.

Meanwhile, Mamba excels at capturing low-frequency features like facial color and fine-grained texture, and does so with lower complexity than Transformers. Motivated by these observations, we propose FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network that decomposes facial features into low- and high-frequency components and processes them via dedicated branches.

While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge.

Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features.

We experiment on IU-xray dataset, which exhibits the aforementioned criteria, and evaluate BiomedCLIP in classifying images (radiographs) in three contexts: zero-shot inference, full finetuning, and linear probing. The results show that the model under zero-shot settings over-predicts all labels, leading to poor precision and inter-class separability. Full fine-tuning improves classification of distinct diseases, while linear probing detects overlapping features.

We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort.

While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings.

However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages.

(2) What makes the challenge unique is inherent perturbed terms by semantic paraphasia, which are not exactly related to the target item, hindering the identification process. To address each, we propose robustifying the model from semantically paraphasic errors and enhancing the model with unseen terms with gradient-based selective augmentation. Specifically, the gradient value controls augmented data quality amid semantic errors, while the gradient variance guides the inclusion of unseen but relevant terms.

Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries.

Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power.

Existing human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods mainly focus on the third-person perspectives, overlooking a more intuitive way from the egocentric view of HOI, namely Ego-HOI. This paper introduces an Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset to promote the benchmarking and development of Ego-HOI detection. Our Ego-HOIBench comprises more than 27K egocentric images with high-quality hand-verb-object triplet annotations across 123 fine-grained interaction categories and locations, covering a rich diversity of scenarios, object types, and hand configurations in daily activities. In addition, we explore and adapt third-person HOI detection methods to Ego-HOIBench and illustrate the challenges of hand-occluded objects and the complexity of single- and two-hand interactions. To build a new baseline, we propose a Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR) scheme, which leverages hand pose and geometric information as valuable cues for interpreting interactions. Specifically, the HGIR scheme explicitly extracts global hand geometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals and refines the interaction-specific features using pose-interaction attention. This scheme enables the model to obtain a robust and powerful interaction representation, significantly improving the Ego-HOI detection capability. Our approach is lightweight and effective, and it can be easily applied to HOI baselines in a plug-and-play manner to achieve state-of-the-art results on Ego-HOIBench.

Generating mixed-type data, especially high-quality tabular data, still faces significant challenges. These primarily include its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-variable relationships, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model-based generative model specifically designed to handle mixed tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, while being more flexible in capturing complex interactions among variables. We further propose a hybrid adaptive causal regularization method based on the principle of Hierarchical Prior Fusion. This approach adaptively controls the weight of causal regularization, enhancing the model's performance without compromising its generative capabilities.

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality.

While models have become proficient at detecting explicit patterns, which typically appear in texts as single remarks referred to as utterances, such as social media posts, malicious actors have shifted toward utilizing implicit influential verbal patterns embedded within conversations. These verbal patterns aim to mentally penetrate the victim's mind in order to influence them, enabling the actor to obtain the desired information through implicit means. This paper presents an improved approach for detecting such implicit influential patterns. Furthermore, the proposed model is capable of identifying the specific locations of these influential elements within a conversation.

However, existing methods rely on separately pre-trained vision and text encoders, resulting in a significant gap between the two modalities in terms of spatial geometry and semantic categories. This discrepancy often causes errors in object positioning and classification. The paper proposes UniSpace-3D, which innovatively introduces a unified representation space for 3DVG, effectively bridging the gap between visual and textual features. Specifically, UniSpace-3D incorporates three innovative designs: i) a unified representation encoder that leverages the pre-trained CLIP model to map visual and textual features into a unified representation space, effectively bridging the gap between the two modalities; ii) a multi-modal contrastive learning module that further reduces the modality gap; iii) a language-guided query selection module that utilizes the positional and semantic information to identify object candidate points aligned with textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSpace-3D outperforms baseline models by at least 2.24% on the ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets.

For example in TRC, we need to understand the temporal semantic differences between the following two questions that are lexically near-identical: \"What finished right before the decision?\" or \"What finished right after the decision?\". To discern the two questions, existing solutions have relied on answer overlaps as a proxy label to contrast similar and dissimilar questions. However, we claim that answer overlap can lead to unreliable results, due to spurious overlaps of two dissimilar questions with coincidentally identical answers. To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that elicits proper reasoning behaviors through a module for predicting time spans of events. We introduce the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) operating in a two-step inductive reasoning process: In the first step model initially answers each question with semantic and syntactic information. The next step chains multiple questions on the same event to predict a timeline, which is then used to ground the answers. Results on the TORQUE and TB-dense, TRC and TRE tasks respectively, demonstrate that TRN outperforms previous methods by effectively resolving the spurious overlaps using the predicted timeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TRN\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u56e0\u7b54\u6848\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b54\u6848\u91cd\u53e0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5076\u7136\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTimeline Reasoning Network\uff08TRN\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u53e5\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u4fee\u6b63\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728TORQUE\u548cTB-dense\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cTRN\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "TRN\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, prevailing methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges: (1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments.

In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or programming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing mentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging knowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on the expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning through trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during competition. We introduce Xolver, a training-free multi-agent reasoning framework that equips a black-box LLM with a persistent, evolving memory of holistic experience. Xolver integrates diverse experience modalities, including external and self-retrieval, tool use, collaborative interactions, agent-driven evaluation, and iterative refinement. By learning from relevant strategies, code fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver avoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated inference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight and proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning agents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses advanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high.

Automating the key task of visual bridge inspection, classification of defects and building components on pixel level, improves efficiency, increases accuracy and enhances safety in the inspection process and resulting building assessment. Models overtaking this task must cope with an assortment of real-world conditions. They must be robust to variations in image quality, as well as background texture, as defects often appear on surfaces of diverse texture and degree of weathering. dacl10k is the largest and most diverse dataset for real-world concrete bridge inspections. However, the dataset exhibits class imbalance, which leads to notably poor model performance particularly when segmenting fine-grained classes such as cracks and cavities. This work introduces \"synth-dacl\", a compilation of three novel dataset extensions based on synthetic concrete textures.

Integrating external tools, such as calculators and databases, into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing problem-solving capabilities. Current methods assign a unique token to each tool, enabling LLMs to call tools through token prediction-similar to word generation. However, this approach fails to account for the relationship between tool and word tokens, limiting adaptability within pre-trained LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel token learning method that aligns tool tokens with the existing word embedding space from the perspective of initialization, thereby enhancing model performance. We begin by constructing prior token embeddings for each tool based on the tool's name or description, which are used to initialize and regularize the learnable tool token embeddings. This ensures the learned embeddings are well-aligned with the word token space, improving tool call accuracy. We evaluate the method on tasks such as numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and embodied plan generation using GSM8K-XL, FuncQA, KAMEL, and VirtualHome datasets.

However, there are two major challenges: 1) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail; and 2) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively combine all available information.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel task called timely dialogue response generation and introduce the TimelyChat benchmark, which evaluates the capabilities of language models to predict appropriate time intervals and generate time-conditioned responses. Additionally, we construct a large-scale training dataset by leveraging unlabeled event knowledge from a temporal commonsense knowledge graph and employing a large language model (LLM) to synthesize 55K event-driven dialogues.

This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations. Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline.

However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm ECPO, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization. ECPO ingeniously eliminates the significant sampling overhead of existing MTPO methods while ensuring the optimization process drives meaningful improvements. To support ECPO, we introduce an LLM-based user simulator, AILO, to simulate user feedback and perform expectation confirmation during conversational recommendations. Experimental results show that ECPO significantly enhances CRA's interaction capabilities, delivering notable improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness over existing MTPO methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5ECPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u671f\u671b\u786e\u8ba4\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ECPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u671f\u671b\u786e\u8ba4\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\uff08AILO\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eECPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ECPO\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

With this perspective, we train an image diffusion model directly in the space of functional maps, enabling it to generate accurate maps conditioned on an inaccurate initial map. The training is done purely in the functional space, and thus is highly efficient. At inference time, we use the pointwise map corresponding to the current functional map as guidance during the diffusion process. The guidance can additionally encourage different functional map objectives, such as orthogonality and commutativity with the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

Existing approaches face three key challenges: 1) Excessive pre-training cost arising from multi-stage pre-training pipelines, 2) Ineffective spatial-temporal encoding due to manually split 3D rotary positional embeddings that hinder feature interactions, and 3) Imprecise learning objectives in soft-label multi-instance retrieval, which neglect negative pair correlations. In this paper, we introduce EVA02-AT, a suite of EVA02-based video-language foundation models tailored to egocentric video understanding tasks. EVA02-AT first efficiently transfers an image-based CLIP model into a unified video encoder via a single-stage pretraining. Second, instead of applying rotary positional embeddings to isolated dimensions, we introduce spatial-temporal rotary positional embeddings along with joint attention, which can effectively encode both spatial and temporal information on the entire hidden dimension. This joint encoding of spatial-temporal features enables the model to learn cross-axis relationships, which are crucial for accurately modeling motion and interaction in videos. Third, focusing on multi-instance video-language retrieval tasks, we introduce the Symmetric Multi-Similarity (SMS) loss and a novel training framework that advances all soft labels for both positive and negative pairs, providing a more precise learning objective. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego under zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate that EVA02-AT achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse egocentric video-language tasks with fewer parameters. Models with our SMS loss also show significant performance gains on multi-instance retrieval benchmarks.

To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present ImpliRet, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving \"two days ago\"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships.

In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types. Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg framework in land cover mapping tasks.

Furthermore, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct \\textbf{\\textit{local perception}} phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments. We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short.

Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation.

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG).

To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each.

Verifying whether a specific LLM was trained on particular data instances or an entire dataset is extremely challenging. Dataset watermarking addresses this by embedding identifiable modifications in training data to detect unauthorized use. However, existing methods often lack stealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove. In light of these limitations, we propose LexiMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for text and documents, which embeds synonym substitutions for carefully selected high-entropy words. Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization capabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of the text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending seamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal due to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated and manual detection.

Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops.

In this work, we first define the first-level and second-level attributes of images and then introduce a CLIP-based framework to construct a visual attribute dictionary, enabling automatic evaluation of image attributes. By systematically analyzing both single-attribute imbalance and compositional attribute imbalance, we reveal how the rarity of attributes affects model performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose adjusting the sampling probability of samples based on the rarity of their compositional attributes. This strategy is further integrated with various data augmentation techniques (such as CutMix, Fmix, and SaliencyMix) to enhance the model's ability to represent rare attributes.

While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify \"heavy-tailedness.\" Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance.

However, previous works primarily utilized full-precision experts during sparse up-cycling.

In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower.

Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models leverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses, limiting interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable \"code agent\" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions.

Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%).

In this study, we fine-tune a lightweight 3B parameter vision-language model for Radiological VQA, demonstrating that small models, when appropriately tuned with curated data, can achieve robust performance across both open- and closed-ended questions. We propose a cost-effective training pipeline from synthetic question-answer pair generation to multi-stage fine-tuning on specialised radiological domain-targeted datasets (e.g., ROCO v2.0, MedPix v2.0). Our results show that despite operating at a fraction of the scale of state-of-the-art models such as LLaVA-Med, our model achieves promising performance given its small parameter size and the limited scale of training data. We introduce a lightweight saliency-based diagnostic tool that enables domain experts to inspect VQA model performance and identify ill-conditioned failure modes through saliency analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u653e\u5c04\u5b66VQA\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982ROCO v2.0\u3001MedPix v2.0\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LLaVA-Med\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u5b66VQA\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

While existing MLLMs demonstrate impressive world understanding capabilities through limited field-of-view (FOV) visual inputs (e.g., 70 degree), we take the first step toward dense understanding from omnidirectional panoramas. We first introduce an omnidirectional panoramas dataset featuring a comprehensive suite of reliability-scored annotations. Specifically, our dataset contains 160K panoramas with 5M dense entity-level captions, 1M unique referring expressions, and 100K entity-grounded panoramic scene descriptions. Compared to multi-view alternatives, panoramas can provide more complete, compact, and continuous scene representations through equirectangular projections (ERP). However, the use of ERP introduces two key challenges for MLLMs: i) spatial continuity along the circle of latitude, and ii) latitude-dependent variation in information density. We address these challenges through ERP-RoPE, a position encoding scheme specifically designed for panoramic ERP.

Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels.

Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u5fb7\u8bed\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8c03\u67e5\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u8868\u73b0\u6ee1\u610f\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u56e0LLM\u800c\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u590d\u6742\u4e3b\u9898\u8c03\u67e5\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fb7\u8bed\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "LLM\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u6ee1\u610f\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\uff1b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9700\u6743\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Speech, as a natural and intuitive modality, offers a promising alternative.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SpeechRefer}, a novel 3DVG framework designed to enhance performance in the presence of noisy and ambiguous speech-to-text transcriptions. SpeechRefer integrates seamlessly with xisting 3DVG models and introduces two key innovations. First, the Speech Complementary Module captures acoustic similarities between phonetically related words and highlights subtle distinctions, generating complementary proposal scores from the speech signal. This reduces dependence on potentially erroneous transcriptions. Second, the Contrastive Complementary Module employs contrastive learning to align erroneous text features with corresponding speech features, ensuring robust performance even when transcription errors dominate.

Through systematic experiments, we find that for recent strong models such as the Qwen2.5 series, adding traditional CoT exemplars does not improve reasoning performance compared to Zero-Shot CoT. Instead, their primary function is to align the output format with human expectations.

Most existing methods depend on hand-crafted features, key frames like onset, apex, and offset frames, or deep networks limited by small-scale and low-diversity datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework with advantages from transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution. In particular, we propose a novel F5C block composed of fully-connected convolution and channel correspondence convolution to directly extract local-global features from a sequence of raw frames, without the prior knowledge of key frames. The transformer-style fully-connected convolution is proposed to extract local features while maintaining global receptive fields, and the graph-style channel correspondence convolution is introduced to model the correlations among feature patterns. Moreover, MER, optical flow estimation, and facial landmark detection are jointly trained by sharing the local-global features.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on CASME II, SAMM, and SMIC benchmarks, (ii) works well for optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection, and (iii) can capture facial subtle muscle actions in local regions associated with MEs.

This study explores the extent to which fine-tuned LLMs can replicate and amplify polarizing discourse within online environments.

The model's outputs are evaluated through linguistic analysis, sentiment scoring, and human annotation, with particular attention to credibility and rhetorical alignment with the original discourse. The results indicate that, when trained on partisan data, LLMs are capable of producing highly plausible and provocative comments, often indistinguishable from those written by humans.

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic evaluation of their complex reasoning ability within spatial contexts remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' spatial intelligence through video-based reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises nearly 1K video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene and captured by video. By carefully designing questions and corresponding 3D scenes, our benchmark ensures that solving the questions requires both spatial comprehension for extracting information and high-level reasoning for deriving solutions, making it a challenging benchmark for evaluating VLMs. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine. This engine, leveraging multiple specialized LLM agents, can generate realistic 3D scenes from abstract math problems, ensuring faithfulness to the original descriptions.

However, their performance is limited by the small number of trainable parameters. Recent work combines LoRA with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), i.e., LoRA-MoE, to enhance capacity, but two limitations remain in hindering the full exploitation of its potential: 1) the influence of downstream tasks when assigning expert numbers, and 2) the uniform rank assignment across all LoRA experts, which restricts representational diversity. To mitigate these gaps, we propose GuiLoMo, a fine-grained layer-wise expert numbers and ranks allocation strategy with GuidedSelection Vectors (GSVs). GSVs are learned via a prior bilevel optimization process to capture both model- and task-specific needs, and are then used to allocate optimal expert numbers and ranks. Experiments on three backbone models across diverse benchmarks show that GuiLoMo consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines.

Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: \"Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?\" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains.

The background can be specified by natural images (image-based relighting) or generated from unlimited text prompts (text-based relighting). Existing studies primarily focus on image-based relighting, while with scant exploration into text-based scenarios. Some works employ intricate disentanglement pipeline designs relying on environment maps to provide relevant information, which grapples with the expensive data cost required for intrinsic decomposition and light source. Other methods take this task as an image translation problem and perform pixel-level transformation with autoencoder architecture. While these methods have achieved decent harmonization effects, they struggle to generate realistic and natural light interaction effects between the foreground and background. To alleviate these challenges, we reorganize the input data into a unified format and leverage the semantic prior provided by the pretrained diffusion model to facilitate the generation of natural results.

Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve.

First, we identify optimization instability during RL training, and we propose Constrained Contextual Computation Policy Optimization(C3PO), a novel approach that enhances training stability and improves computational throughput via algorithm-system co-design methodology. Second, we empirically demonstrate that selecting distillation checkpoints based on entropy loss for RL training, rather than validation metrics, yields superior performance-efficiency trade-offs in subsequent RL training.

Despite recent advances in enhancing language model (LM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover strong positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains.

As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output. Experimental results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets show that our method exceeds state-of-the-art approaches.

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and similar schemes split text once, build a static vocabulary, and leave the model stuck with that choice. We relax this rigidity by introducing an autoregressive U-Net that learns to embed its own tokens as it trains. The network reads raw bytes, pools them into words, then pairs of words, then up to 4 words, giving it a multi-scale view of the sequence. At deeper stages, the model must predict further into the future -- anticipating the next few words rather than the next byte -- so deeper stages focus on broader semantic patterns while earlier stages handle fine details. When carefully tuning and controlling pretraining compute, shallow hierarchies tie strong BPE baselines, and deeper hierarchies have a promising trend.

Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives.

However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters.

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution.

Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for stable quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW.

ICE-ID spans multiple generations of longitudinal data, capturing name variations, demographic changes, and rich genealogical links. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, open tabular dataset specifically designed to study long-term person-entity matching in a real-world population. We define identity resolution tasks (within and across census waves) with clearly documented metrics and splits. We evaluate a range of methods: handcrafted rule-based matchers, a ML ensemble as well as LLMs for structured data (e.g. transformer-based tabular networks) against a novel approach to tabular data called NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) - a general-purpose AI framework designed to reason with limited knowledge and resources. Its core is Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL), a term-based logic. Our experiments show that NARS is suprisingly simple and competitive with other standard approaches, achieving SOTA at our task.

The rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has enabled a rethinking of geo-localization as a reasoning-driven task grounded in visual cues. However, two major challenges persist. On the data side, existing reasoning-focused datasets are primarily based on street-view imagery, offering limited scene diversity and constrained viewpoints. On the modeling side, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning, which yields only marginal improvements in reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs a reasoning-oriented geo-localization dataset, MP16-Reason, using diverse social media images. We introduce GLOBE, Group-relative policy optimization for Locatability assessment and Optimized visual-clue reasoning, yielding Bi-objective geo-Enhancement for the VLM in recognition and reasoning. GLOBE incorporates task-specific rewards that jointly enhance locatability assessment, visual clue reasoning, and geolocation accuracy.

The router-based configuration achieved performance scores of 95.00% for shallow foundations and 90.63% for pile design, representing improvements of 8.75 and 3.13 percentage points over standalone Grok 3 performance respectively.

However, existing methods often support only limited interaction forms and struggle to capture fine details. In this paper, we revisit the classical coarse-to-fine design of FocalClick and introduce significant extensions. Inspired by its multi-stage strategy, we propose a novel pipeline, FocalClick-XL, to address these challenges simultaneously. Following the emerging trend of large-scale pretraining, we decompose interactive segmentation into meta-tasks that capture different levels of information -- context, object, and detail -- assigning a dedicated subnet to each level.This decomposition allows each subnet to undergo scaled pretraining with independent data and supervision, maximizing its effectiveness. To enhance flexibility, we share context- and detail-level information across different interaction forms as common knowledge while introducing a prompting layer at the object level to encode specific interaction types. As a result, FocalClick-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance on click-based benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to diverse interaction formats, including boxes, scribbles, and coarse masks.

We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via \"capability gain\" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the \"off-policy\" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks.

Although existing methods have made progress in cross-modal interaction, low-light conditions, and model lightweight, there are still challenges like the lack of a unified single-stage framework, difficulty in balancing performance and fusion strategy, and unreasonable modality weight allocation. To address these, based on the YOLOv11 framework, we present YOLOv11-RGBT, a new comprehensive multimodal object detection framework. We designed six multispectral fusion modes and successfully applied them to models from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12 and RT-DETR. After reevaluating the importance of the two modalities, we proposed a P3 mid-fusion strategy and multispectral controllable fine-tuning (MCF) strategy for multispectral models. These improvements optimize feature fusion, reduce redundancy and mismatches, and boost overall model performance. Experiments show our framework excels on three major open-source multispectral object detection datasets, like LLVIP and FLIR. Particularly, the multispectral controllable fine-tuning strategy significantly enhanced model adaptability and robustness. On the FLIR dataset, it consistently improved YOLOv11 models' mAP by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching a maximum of 47.61%, verifying the framework and strategies' effectiveness.

The fusion of camera and LiDAR data addresses the limitations of individual sensors but relies on precise extrinsic calibration. Recently, numerous end-to-end calibration methods have been proposed; however, most predict extrinsic parameters in a single step and lack iterative optimization capabilities. To address the increasing demand for higher accuracy, we propose a versatile iterative framework based on surrogate diffusion. This framework can enhance the performance of any calibration method without requiring architectural modifications. Specifically, the initial extrinsic parameters undergo iterative refinement through a denoising process, in which the original calibration method serves as a surrogate denoiser to estimate the final extrinsics at each step. For comparative analysis, we selected four state-of-the-art calibration methods as surrogate denoisers and compared the results of our diffusion process with those of two other iterative approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when integrated with our diffusion model, all calibration methods achieve higher accuracy, improved robustness, and greater stability compared to other iterative techniques and their single-step counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u4e0eLiDAR\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u5916\u53c2\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5355\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

In this work, we first extensively analyze the types of errors encountered during the function-calling process on several competitive tool evaluation benchmarks. Based on it, we introduce CRITICTOOL, a comprehensive critique evaluation benchmark specialized for tool learning. Building upon a novel evolutionary strategy for dataset construction, CRITICTOOL holds diverse tool-use errors with varying complexities, which better reflects real-world scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on CRITICTOOL, and validate the generalization and effectiveness of our constructed benchmark strategy. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the tool reflection ability on various LLMs, offering a new perspective on the field of tool learning in LLMs. The code is available at \\href{https://github.com/Shellorley0513/CriticTool}{https://github.com/Shellorley0513/CriticTool}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CRITICTOOL\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u89e6\u53d1\u5404\u79cd\u610f\u5916\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\u4e86CRITICTOOL\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "CRITICTOOL\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "CRITICTOOL\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While traditional stereo and active depth sensors have limitations in cost, power, and robustness, dual-pixel (DP) technology, ubiquitous in modern cameras, offers a compelling alternative.

DiFuse-Net features a window bi-directional parallax attention mechanism (WBiPAM) specifically designed to capture the subtle DP disparity cues unique to smartphone cameras with small aperture. A separate encoder extracts contextual information from the RGB image, and these features are fused to enhance depth prediction. We also propose a Cross-modal Transfer Learning (CmTL) mechanism to utilize large-scale RGB-D datasets in the literature to cope with the limitations of obtaining large-scale RGB-DP-D dataset. Our evaluation and comparison of the proposed method demonstrates its superiority over the DP and stereo-based baseline methods.

AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents.

Using interferometric SAR data from Sentinel-1, we apply a long temporal-arc coherent change detection (LT-CCD) approach to track weekly damage trends over the first year of the 2023- Israel-Hamas War. We detect 92.5% of damage labels in reference data from the United Nations with a negligible (1.2%) false positive rate. The temporal fidelity of our approach reveals rapidly increasing damage during the first three months of the war focused in northern Gaza, a notable pause in damage during a temporary ceasefire, and surges of new damage as conflict hot-spots shift from north to south.

In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents.

A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second.

Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts.

Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models.

They over-rely on partial cues and generate incorrect responses. Recently, methods like Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) and Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by contrasting predictions from perturbed or negatively prefixed inputs against original outputs. In this work, we uncover that methods like VCD and ICD fundamentally influence internal attention dynamics of the model. This observation suggests that their effectiveness may not stem merely from surface-level modifications to logits but from deeper shifts in attention distribution. Inspired by this insight, we propose an attention-steerable contrastive decoding framework that directly intervenes in attention mechanisms of the model to offer a more principled approach to mitigating hallucinations.

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods.

This contribution introduces the Fretting-Transformer, an encoderdecoder model that utilizes a T5 transformer architecture to automate the transcription of MIDI sequences into guitar tablature. By framing the task as a symbolic translation problem, the model addresses key challenges, including string-fret ambiguity and physical playability. The proposed system leverages diverse datasets, including DadaGP, GuitarToday, and Leduc, with novel data pre-processing and tokenization strategies. We have developed metrics for tablature accuracy and playability to quantitatively evaluate the performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the Fretting-Transformer surpasses baseline methods like A* and commercial applications like Guitar Pro.

However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned models often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for solution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights existing reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we resolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the $Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct final answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of thought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric, $CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final answer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how RLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical integrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we observe that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for all values of $K$.

This paper introduces D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, a video-language query engine that accelerates ViT-based VideoLMs by reusing computations across consecutive frames. At its core is ReuseViT, a modified ViT model specifically designed for VideoLM tasks, which learns to detect inter-frame reuse opportunities, striking an effective balance between accuracy and reuse. Although ReuseViT significantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into performance gains on GPUs. To overcome this, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu integrates memory-compute joint compaction techniques that convert the FLOP savings into tangible performance gains.

However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard.

Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

Despite its rapid growth and algorithmic relevance, the field of computational studies in influencer marketing remains fragmented, especially with limited systematic reviews covering the computational methodologies employed. This makes overarching scientific measurements in the influencer economy very scarce, to the detriment of interested stakeholders outside of platforms themselves, such as regulators, but also researchers from other fields. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of computational studies in influencer marketing by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) based on the PRISMA model. The paper analyses 69 studies to identify key research themes, methodologies, and future directions in this research field. The review identifies four major research themes: Influencer identification and characterisation, Advertising strategies and engagement, Sponsored content analysis and discovery, and Fairness. Methodologically, the studies are categorised into machine learning-based techniques (e.g., classification, clustering) and non-machine-learning-based techniques (e.g., statistical analysis, network analysis). Key findings reveal a strong focus on optimising commercial outcomes, with limited attention to regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. The review highlights the need for more nuanced computational research that incorporates contextual factors such as language, platform, and industry type, as well as improved model explainability and dataset reproducibility. The paper concludes by proposing a multidisciplinary research agenda that emphasises the need for further links to regulation and compliance technology, finer granularity in analysis, and the development of standardised datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7f51\u7ea2\u8425\u9500\u9886\u57df\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8669\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u5927\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7ea2\u8425\u9500\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u8425\u9500\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u79d1\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5e73\u53f0\u5916\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u7ba1\u8005\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u8005\uff09\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PRISMA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u679069\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u975e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u56db\u5927\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u9898\uff1a\u7f51\u7ea2\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5e7f\u544a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u8d5e\u52a9\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5546\u4e1a\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002"}}

In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models.

We identify a core aspect of this issue as \"invalid thinking\" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression.

Bleeding detection and localization during surgery is especially challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that reflect real surgical scenarios. We propose orGAN, a GAN-based system for generating high-fidelity, annotated surgical images of bleeding. By leveraging small \"mimicking organ\" datasets, synthetic models that replicate tissue properties and bleeding, our approach reduces ethical concerns and data-collection costs. orGAN builds on StyleGAN with Relational Positional Learning to simulate bleeding events realistically and mark bleeding coordinates.

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

In this work, we present a new curated MRI dataset designed specifically for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans annotated by certified radiologists and physicians, spanning three major tumor types-glioma, meningioma, and pituitary-as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we propose a transformer-based segmentation model and benchmark it against established baselines. Our method achieves the highest weighted mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 82.3%, with improvements observed across all tumor categories. Importantly, this study serves primarily as an introduction to the dataset, establishing foundational benchmarks for future research.

We extend self-explainable Prototypical Variational models with autoencoder-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection: A Variational Autoencoder is applied to learn a meaningful latent space which can be used for distance-based classification, likelihood estimation for OOD detection, and reconstruction. The In-Distribution (ID) region is defined by a Gaussian mixture distribution with learned prototypes representing the center of each mode.

The reconstructive capabilities of the Autoencoder ensure the explainability of the prototypes and the ID region of the classifier, further aiding the discrimination of OOD samples.

This study investigates the impact of domain shift on WMH segmentation by proposing maximum-entropy regularization techniques to enhance model calibration and uncertainty estimation, with the purpose of identifying errors post-deployment using predictive uncertainty as a proxy measure that does not require ground-truth labels. To do this, we conducted experiments using a U-Net architecture to evaluate these regularization schemes on two publicly available datasets, assessing performance with the Dice coefficient, expected calibration error, and entropy-based uncertainty estimates.

GAMORA achieved a mean positional discrepancy of 2.2 mm (improved from 4 mm), pipetting accuracy within 0.2 mL, and repeatability of 1.2 mm across 50 trials. Integrated object detection via YOLOv8 enhances spatial awareness, while energy-efficient operation (50% reduced power output) ensures sustainable deployment.

The radiomics-enhanced attention-augmented U-Net model showed a greater model stability evidenced by reduced performance variability (SDD = 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.09 vs. 0.21 $\\pm$ 0.06; p=0.03) and smoother validation curves with radiomics integration.\n  Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that fusing radiomics with raw imaging data boosts segmentation performance and stability in state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\uff08MS\uff09\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MS\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6d53\u5ea6\u7387\u548cR\u00e9nyi\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ResNeXt-UNet\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u878d\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684ResNeXt-UNet\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff08Dice\u5206\u65700.774\u00b10.05\uff09\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0e\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.\n  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7968\u5668\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7968\u5668\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08SVM\u3001CNN\u3001ViT\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7269\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f5%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u4e3e\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\u9009\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7968\u5668\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u853d\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Producing high-quality reconstructions typically requires many X-ray measurements; this process can be slow and expensive, especially for dense materials. Recent work incorporating artifact reduction priors within a plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction framework has shown promising results in improving image quality from sparse-view XCT scans while enhancing the generalizability of deep learning-based solutions. However, this method uses a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for artifact reduction, which captures only slice-independent information from the 3D reconstruction, limiting performance. In this paper, we propose a PnP reconstruction method that uses a 2.5D artifact reduction CNN as the prior. This approach leverages inter-slice information from adjacent slices, capturing richer spatial context while remaining computationally efficient. We show that this 2.5D prior not only improves the quality of reconstructions but also enables the model to directly suppress commonly occurring XCT artifacts (such as beam hardening), eliminating the need for artifact correction pre-processing. Experiments on both experimental and synthetic cone-beam XCT data demonstrate that the proposed method better preserves fine structural details, such as pore size and shape, leading to more accurate defect detection compared to 2D priors. In particular, we demonstrate strong performance on experimental XCT data using a 2.5D artifact reduction prior trained entirely on simulated scans, highlighting the proposed method's ability to generalize across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2.5D CNN\u7684PnP\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feXCT\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u90bb\u5207\u7247\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2D CNN\u5728XCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u5207\u7247\u72ec\u7acb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c2.5D CNN\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282.5D CNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PnP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c2.5D\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5b54\u9699\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u548c\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\uff08\u5982\u675f\u786c\u5316\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e2D\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "2.5D CNN\u5148\u9a8c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86XCT\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
