VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner."}

By\nclosing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO\nsignificantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized\nrepresentations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show\nthat the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance\nwhile enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more\nadvanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal\nre-alignment."}

In real-world spoken language understanding, effective\ninterpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),\nparalinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological\ncharacteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in\nspeech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their\nability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural\nspeech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning\nin spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated\naudio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our\nbenchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of\nlinguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,\nsemantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced\nSpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,\nhighlighting meaningful directions for future optimization.

Various\nneural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good\nrepresentations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been\nestablished. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed\nmethod on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.\nWe believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human\ndevelopment of object recognition in the real world."}

To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds.

To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore\nutilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as\nwell as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge\ntransfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated\ndatasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization\nbenchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it\nis often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained\nmodel. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo\nare cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot\ngeneralization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost,\nhigh-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.\nMoreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods\nhave achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness\nfalls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration."}

Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,\nrevealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static\nencyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess\nperformance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by\ntesting search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and\nconventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does\nnot degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,\nthe quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on\nthe model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future\nresearch in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:\nhttps://github.com/lmarena/search-arena."}

In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model\nmiscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model\ngenerations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using\ncontrolled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which\npreference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this\npreference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high\nmiscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features\nonly show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =\n-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a\nstrong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely\non spurious cues.

However, adapting these pretrained PFMs\nfor specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to\nthe availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images,\nnecessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI\nanalysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \\textbf{T}ask\n\\textbf{A}daptation of \\textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer\n(\\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature\nrepresentations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate\ncomputational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training\ndynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end\nadaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung\nadenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently\noutperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the\nbenchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable\nmutations as well.

For example, in group chats, online team\nmeetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the\ndecision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision\nmaking. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in\naddition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate\nour agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both\nhuman participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent\nperforms on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its\nability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the\nagent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,\nalthough differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and\ncode to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous\ncommunication between LLM agents.

We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method\nthat integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a\nunified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination\nand suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address\nsignal-dependent noise.

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss.

To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

The\nscheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex\ninsertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial\nsegmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly\nhave high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low\ncurvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex\ninsertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes\nslowly but steadily.

PLUCC consists of three\ncomponents: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and\npositioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts\nmultiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that\ncombines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in\naddition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization\nError (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing\nperspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC\non the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,\nsurpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of\n12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical\nrole of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with\nbroad implications for automated sports analysis."}

This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited\nresponse diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation\nsacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,\nensuring compatibility with AR.

HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

The results underscore the significant\nchallenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models\nlike DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their\nin-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.\nFurthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still\nlag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:\nhttps://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs"}

We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to\nreason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first\nprompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to\ndisclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to\nachieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\\sim700$\nexamples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show\nthat our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure\nwhile maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.\nImportantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established\nCI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates\nprivacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls."}

In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open\nGaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D\nreconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open\nGaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic\nconsistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are\ninitialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent\ninpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces\nbidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion\nmodel. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient\nand progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we\nestablish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and\ngenerative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes.

Building upon the Molmo architecture,\nVideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to\ncondition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency.\nAdditionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for\nbidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video\nsequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate\nprecise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module\nto produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language\nmodel but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets,\nwe curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated\nwith 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we\nintroduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five\nreal-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving,\nVideo-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring\nVideo Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to\nexisting models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing\naccuracy and reasoning capability.

To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss.

To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space.

The initial\nsegmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly\nhave high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low\ncurvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex\ninsertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes\nslowly but steadily.

This challenge is particularly\npronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios\nfurther complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we\npropose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in\nUnreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for\nrapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can\nachieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while\nsignificantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data.\nAdditionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases\nobject detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images\nwith the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in\nthe highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation\nexperiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par\nwith one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot\nsoccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive\nalternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive\nerror-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator\nwhere all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations\nwhile significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly\nvaluable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training\ndata."}

Contrastive self-supervised\nand vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology\ndatasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative\nmodels, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a\ncompelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve\nsynthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling\nprivacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks,\nsuch as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based\ngenerative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M,\na vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\\&E-stained whole slide images\ncovering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a\nself-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without\nany annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across\nmultiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train\na self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between\ninstitutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case\nwith real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely\ncontrol image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be\nused for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell\nsegmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,\nimproving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to\nuse H\\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we\nuse this capability to infer IHC staining from H\\&E images. Our trained models\nare publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology."}

Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to\ncapture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently\nregularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow\nmatching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally\nprove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally\ntractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the\nlog-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed\nmethod eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids\nODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a\ncontrolled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the\nnegative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the\neffectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments\non ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed\ndiscussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical\nvalidation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment."}

We present\nDM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions\nwith anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a\nquadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning\nto maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer\nthat enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state\nmodeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state\nsynchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically\nsignificant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving\nstate-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse\ndataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset\nfor brain tumor segmentation."}
