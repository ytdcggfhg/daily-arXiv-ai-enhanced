OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=SIBkIV48gF", "summary": "Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly\nimpact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and\nhelpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic\nanalysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these\ncore alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two\ndistinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness\nundermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution\nreduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts\nin token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between\nalignment objectives.\n  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an\ninference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore\nalignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in\nexpected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically\ndemonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers\nor surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores.

However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on\ncurated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to\nscale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit\nhuman Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate\npreference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in\ngenerating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and\nimplicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address\nreaders' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates\nresponses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text\nfor response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This\napproach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,\ndomain-specific alignment.

A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods.

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based\nqueries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite\nreflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,\nlocation analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric\nreasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,\nincluding MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The\nbest-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge\nthe gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a\ncomprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200\nrandomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved\nsuperior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best\nradiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI\nperformance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The\nreader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human\nexperts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing\nmore variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models.

In this\nparadigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning\nproblems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return\ncorrect solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,\nstruggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,\nindicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world\nscenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical\ndiversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus\nobscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to\naddress this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical\ndiversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into\nlexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'\nability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on\nthese new datasets.

Building directly on the deficiencies\nidentified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address\nthis limitation.

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbVAR\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u6b65\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "VAR\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u5212\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cHMAR\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HMAR\u5c06\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6b65\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5757\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5185\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHMAR\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eVAR\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "HMAR\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VAR\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors.

However, these\nmethods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically\nevaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we\npropose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face\ndefrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction\nmodel. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference\nstep. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization\nFFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed\nusing our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial\nfeature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly\ndefrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with\nour previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared\nwith the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and\nMulti-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without\ndefrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over\nthe state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger\nopen-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses\n(75 and 90 degrees). The results suggest that at least some of the current\nmethods may be overfitted to small datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u53bb\u6b63\u9762\u5316\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u9762\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eFFWM\u7684\u53bb\u6b63\u9762\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u5728\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u968f\u673a\u53bb\u6b63\u9762\u5316\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eArcFace\u635f\u5931\u7684ResNet-50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728LFW\u3001AgeDB\u548cCFP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Multi-PIE\u6781\u7aef\u59ff\u6001\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u6b63\u9762\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002"}}

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far.

Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art.

By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a\ngenerative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task,\nenabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory\nchanges or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked\ninpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video\ngeneration. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first\nperform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that\nindicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks\nare introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined\nwith the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During\ntraining, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and\nchallenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and\nrobustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal\nconsistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning\nstrategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the\nmodel is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning\niteration.

In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the\ncommonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in\ncombination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver\nhigh-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous\nverification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial\nsimilarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively\nadjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided\nrefinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body\nfeatures, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via\nnatural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static\npre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users\ninto the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven\nprocedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully\nrigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance,\nmaking them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications.\nQuantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar\noutperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of\nreconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and\nanimation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable\navatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "SmartAvatar\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5f20\u7167\u7247\u6216\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b\u5c31\u7eea\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5316\u8eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u4f53\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u753b\u5c31\u7eea\u6027\uff0cSmartAvatar\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8c03\u6574\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5316\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u59ff\u52bf\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u753b\u5c31\u7eea\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SmartAvatar\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5316\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In real-world spoken language understanding, effective\ninterpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),\nparalinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological\ncharacteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in\nspeech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their\nability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural\nspeech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning\nin spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated\naudio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our\nbenchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of\nlinguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,\nsemantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced\nSpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,\nhighlighting meaningful directions for future optimization.

Various\nneural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good\nrepresentations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been\nestablished. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a\npair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that\ntransformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic\nstructural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that\ndisentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we\nfound that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in\nGalois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more\ngeneral representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature\nextraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,\nwhich prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed\nmethod on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.\nWe believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human\ndevelopment of object recognition in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7fa4\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u8f74\u662f\u597d\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u5e73\u79fb\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework\nthat assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark\naccuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,\nto better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We\nconstruct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic\nvariants) and train LLMs under each.

To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma\nwith the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial\nPartial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the\nvisual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial\nfinetuning with few-shot ID data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAPF\nachieves the state-of-the-art ID and OOD accuracy on the ImageNet OOD\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\uff08ID\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLM\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9OOD\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u5347OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SRAPF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "SRAPF\u5728ImageNet OOD\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684ID\u548cOOD\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u90e8\u5206\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861ID\u548cOOD\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0cSRAPF\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos\noffers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and\nsimplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While\nimitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert\ndemonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,\nlearning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.\nTo address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with\nEquivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models\nexpert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the\nstochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual\nrepresentation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a\ndiffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and\nsampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.\nAdditionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric\nsymmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process.

Some methods to address this assume shared label\ntaxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual\nrelabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a\nfixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT),\na label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from\ndiverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset.

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel\nhierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the\nunique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual\nenvironments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical\nstructures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent\nhierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the\nfeature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation\nmechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within\nhyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine\nsearch strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust\nmatching, even between descriptors from different image types.

Our work offers three major\ncontributions: (1) MegaHan97K is the first dataset to fully support the latest\nGB18030-2022 standard, providing at least six times more categories than\nexisting datasets; (2) It effectively addresses the long-tail distribution\nproblem by providing balanced samples across all categories through its three\ndistinct subsets: handwritten, historical and synthetic subsets; (3)\nComprehensive benchmarking experiments reveal new challenges in mega-category\nscenarios, including increased storage demands, morphologically similar\ncharacter recognition, and zero-shot learning difficulties, while also\nunlocking substantial opportunities for future research. To the best of our\nknowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not\nonly in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern\nrecognition.

In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and\ncleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak\nassociations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle\npresence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results\ndemonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban\nmorphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of\ncommercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological\nfrontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in\nneighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for\nperceptual urban diagnostics.

However, current approaches either\naddress partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target\nclinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both\nlimiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called\nVideo-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes\nfull-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists'\noverall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world\nclinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a\ngrading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical\ndecision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern\nMining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists'\nevaluation process.

As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects\nwhether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,\nretrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM\nperformance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.\nFurthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency\nbut also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to\ngenerate the correct answer.

VAR iteratively estimates the\nresidual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process\nreferred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during\npre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only\nVARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results.

We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is\ntrained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the\nfirst time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR.

Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in\ndata space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to\nsmoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby\npreserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and\ncontrollable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that\nmodulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially\nand temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic\nalignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing\nstrategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential\nsignals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward\nstronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.\nExtensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,\nand background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and\ncoherent video editing without inversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowDirector\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u8f6c\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FlowDirector\u5229\u7528ODE\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u6f14\u5316\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowDirector\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowDirector\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a\ncrowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired\nmulti-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans\ndiverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around\n12,000 human preference votes.

This bias manifests as\noverreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues\nlike reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases\noriginate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model\nmiscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model\ngenerations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using\ncontrolled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which\npreference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this\npreference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high\nmiscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features\nonly show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =\n-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a\nstrong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely\non spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training\nmethod based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized\ncontrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration\nfrom 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,\nwhile maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted\ndebiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u597d\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u504f\u597d\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u8d28\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u504f\u597d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08CDA\uff09\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u572860%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u7ea640%\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002CDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece39.4%\u964d\u81f332.5%\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u5dee\u5f02\u4ece20.5%\u964d\u81f310.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CDA\uff09\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Because these methods\npossess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of\ntheoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to\nreturn to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve\nthe TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural\nnetwork models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are\nfirst generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and\nnoise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and\nthe micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour\nmodel. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a\ntwo-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the\nresulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated\nusing Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results.

It compresses unimodal information by\nmodality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal\ninteraction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive\nexperiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,\nvisual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,\nQwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility\nof the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also\nconducted to fully asses our method.

In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of\ncross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on\nvision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first\nintroduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person\nimages and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and\ncross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and\nevaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts\nlearned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists\nbetween recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,\nwe observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more\ncapable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case.

The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient\nand progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we\nestablish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and\ngenerative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes.

This design simplifies what would otherwise be a\ncomplex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the\ninefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g.,\nlarge multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted\ninto three fundamental questions - \"Where is it?\" (structure), \"What is it?\"\n(recognition), and \"How is it organized?\" (relation) - corresponding to layout\nanalysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused\ndecomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable\nprocessing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach,\nwe introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to\ndate), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both\nChinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an\naverage of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content\nsuch as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter\nmodel surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL\n(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on\nEnglish document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page\ndocuments significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for\nMinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B).

Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)\nSelf-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively\nconverts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs\nwhile maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between\nmedical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher\nadaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal\nrepresentations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without\nauxiliary supervision or expensive retraining.

MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to\nenhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining\nto discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame\nsampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator\nemphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous\nones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework,\nusing a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models.\nEntropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and\nconfident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the\nTartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over\n12.29 km.

To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model.

Existing CoVR\nbenchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do\nnot test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We\nintroduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally\nfine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K\ntriplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing\non temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the\nsame video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct\neach <query, modification> pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences\nbetween clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with\nmultiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such\nas sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose\nTF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video\nencoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally\ndiscriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos\nusing contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image,\nvideo, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained\ncomposed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes.

This approach\neliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for\nsingle long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.\nBecause the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT\nmodels adopt it with no retraining.\n  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup\nover standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential\nRMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential\nbottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby\nstrengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diagonal Batching \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664 RMT \u4e2d\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6bb5\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c RMT \u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Diagonal Batching\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728 LLaMA-1B ARMT \u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cDiagonal Batching \u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b LLaMA-1B \u5feb 3.3 \u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u987a\u5e8f RMT \u5feb 1.8 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Diagonal Batching \u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f7f RMT \u6210\u4e3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Among these XAI\nmethods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent\nspace to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual\nlayer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention\nrecently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to\ndetermine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature\nembeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the\noriginal models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer\n(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively\nimpact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced\nwith input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.\nTo address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable\nVision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision\ntransformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT\nemploys conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing\nthem with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration\nof Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical\ndatasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining\ninterpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to\nperturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus\nmeeting the needs of the medical field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVision Concept Transformer (VCT)\u548cStable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b(CBMs)\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7528\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI (XAI)\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709CBMs\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "VCT\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff1bSVCT\u57fa\u4e8eVCT\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Vision Transformer (ViT)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u548cDenoised Diffusion Smoothing\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVCT\u548cSVCT\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1bSVCT\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "VCT\u548cSVCT\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CBMs\u7684\u6548\u7528\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical\nINterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning.

Existing methods either\noverfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize\nnumerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate\nscenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user\ninstructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates\nnumerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial\nreasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the\ngeneration into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting\nit into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial\nreasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we\nemploy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.\nAdditionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance\ngeneralization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses\nasset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context\nlearning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves\nimpressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "DirectLayout\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u62103D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "DirectLayout\u5206\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u5e03\u5c40\uff1a\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u30013D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u653e\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5e03\u5c40\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDirectLayout\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "DirectLayout\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

To overcome this problem, we\npropose FreeTimeGS, a novel 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives\nto appear at arbitrary time and locations. In contrast to canonical Gaussian\nprimitives, our representation possesses the strong flexibility, thus improving\nthe ability to model dynamic 3D scenes. In addition, we endow each Gaussian\nprimitive with an motion function, allowing it to move to neighboring regions\nover time, which reduces the temporal redundancy. Experiments results on\nseveral datasets show that the rendering quality of our method outperforms\nrecent methods by a large margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFreeTimeGS\u7684\u65b0\u578b4D\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFreeTimeGS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd4D\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u8d4b\u4e88\u8fd0\u52a8\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FreeTimeGS\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u76844D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

It requires interpreting\nfine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital\ntext, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In\nsuch multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on\nselectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a\nrich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes\nmulti-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model\ncapabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing\napproaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must\nreason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and\nmodality-rich mathematical problem settings.

This scaling ensures uniform visual\ndifficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful\nreconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and\nperceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

However, even with the powerful pretrained vision\nlanguage models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately\nunderstand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the\ninstruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose\nRoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding\nby integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial\nreasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process\nreward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT\ntraining, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x\nprior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex\nreasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce\nRefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial\nreferring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained\nRoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average\nsuccess rate of 89.6%.

Of course, the process of\ncreating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training\nruns which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and\noutput encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),\nindeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of\nlosses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing\nloss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard\ngradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular\nparameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

The\nscheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex\ninsertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial\nsegmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly\nhave high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low\ncurvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex\ninsertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes\nslowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices\nand so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices.

PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across\nmultiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train\na self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between\ninstitutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case\nwith real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely\ncontrol image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be\nused for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell\nsegmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation,\nimproving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to\nuse H\\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we\nuse this capability to infer IHC staining from H\\&E images.

In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit\nhuman Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate\npreference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in\ngenerating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and\nimplicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address\nreaders' questions.

A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning.

Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures\nwith robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside\nmonitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u7eb5\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u52a0\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u7eb5\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff08Scapegoater\u3001Boaster\u3001Self-Dealer\u3001Free-Rider\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u64cd\u7eb5\u5bf9MAS\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ea7LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982GPT-4o-mini\u548co3-mini\uff09\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u64cd\u7eb5MAS\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684MAS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this\nparadigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning\nproblems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return\ncorrect solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,\nstruggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,\nindicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world\nscenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical\ndiversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus\nobscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to\naddress this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical\ndiversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into\nlexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'\nability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on\nthese new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs\nexhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies\nidentified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address\nthis limitation.

Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets,\nincluding LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random\ncropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve\nmodel robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model\nselection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set,\nwhile signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data\nfrom unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models\nsignificantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning\napproaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video\nquality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the\nmodels, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics)\nachieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60\ndataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating\nstrong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03VideoMAE\u3001ViViT\u548cTimeSformer\u7b49\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728BdSLW60\u548cBdSLW401\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\uff08BdSL\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u542c\u529b\u969c\u788d\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff08VideoMAE\u3001ViViT\u3001TimeSformer\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c10\u6298\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "VideoMAE\u5728BdSLW60\u548cBdSLW401\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523095.5%\u548c81.04%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u9891Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

Existing\nmethodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the\ndevice's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details\nnecessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a\nphysical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively\naddresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of\nRGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors.

More specifically, given the 3D\npoint cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a\n1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then\nprocessed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel\nconvolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides\nsufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and\nintroduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.\nFurthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit\ngrouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and\ntakes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are\nfriendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily\ndeploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D\ndetection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves\ncompetitive performance.

Baseline\nmethods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\\% in\nboth the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is\nachieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable\none-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of\nthe feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability\nof LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive\nexperiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of\nparameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance.\nMoreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit\nsuperior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6838\uff08LSKs\uff09\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08SISR\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u95f4\u63a5\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u7279\u6b8a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u63d0\u5347SISR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800cLSKs\u65e8\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "method": "LSKs\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u79e9\u4e00\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u6838\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLSKs\u51cf\u5c1160%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "LSKs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684SISR\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more\neffective than having access to 2x web data.

Moreover, we propose a complete pipeline\nfor synthesizing high-quality images with fine-grained full-image text masks,\ncombining realistic foreground text regions with detailed background content.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances text\nlegibility in super-resolved images, achieving state-of-the-art performance\nacross multiple evaluation metrics and exhibiting strong generalization to\nreal-world scenarios.

In this study, we provide a simple\nmethod to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by\ncombining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel\ntranslation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as\ngrouping features under the same transformation.

A common\nsolution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

The correction\nmodule then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in\nconjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that\nmaintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for\npost-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain\ncollection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of\nthe English-German parallel corpora used to train the model.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID)\ntask-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot\nadaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation,\naiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation\nmethods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full\nfinetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper\nhyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods\nprompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves\nbetter efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and\ntextual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides\nthe best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we\npropose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple\naugmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves\ntask-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation,\nand (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning.\nResults show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly\nsacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining\nthe two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos\noffers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and\nsimplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While\nimitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert\ndemonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements,\nlearning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios.\nTo address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with\nEquivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models\nexpert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the\nstochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual\nrepresentation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a\ndiffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and\nsampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization.\nAdditionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric\nsymmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process.

By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1)\nabnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic\ndrift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose\nSemantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that\nmitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers.

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or\noutperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we\nchallenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal\nreasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed\ncognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

To this end we create ConECT -- a new\nCzech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and\nproduct metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and\ncompare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We\ntest a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids\ntranslation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual\ninformation into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or\nimage descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation\nof contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine\ntranslation. We make the new dataset publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6377\u514b\u8bed-\u6ce2\u5170\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bcd\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b11,400\u53e5\u5bf9\u7684\u6377\u514b\u8bed-\u6ce2\u5170\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6ConECT\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u8def\u5f84\u7b49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce HypeVPR, a novel\nhierarchical embedding framework in hyperbolic space, designed to address the\nunique challenges of P2E VPR. The key idea behind HypeVPR is that visual\nenvironments captured by panoramic views exhibit inherent hierarchical\nstructures. To leverage this property, we employ hyperbolic space to represent\nhierarchical feature relationships and preserve distance properties within the\nfeature space. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature aggregation\nmechanism that organizes local-to-global feature representations within\nhyperbolic space. Additionally, HypeVPR adopts an efficient coarse-to-fine\nsearch strategy, optimally balancing speed and accuracy to ensure robust\nmatching, even between descriptors from different image types.

To the best of our\nknowledge, the MetaHan97K is likely the dataset with the largest classes not\nonly in the field of OCR but may also in the broader domain of pattern\nrecognition.

To model this\nintuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using\nsupervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space\nstructured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects\nevaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable\ntransitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur\nentirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions,\nwithout relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our\nmodel achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593.

Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence\nmay enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in\nnarrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and\nshop-level pricing.

Street width moderates the effects of vehicle\npresence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results\ndemonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban\nmorphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of\ncommercial success.

We address these limitations through two novel\ncomponents: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale\nimage tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while\nsimultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the\nLR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over\nthe former.

We show that language models are capable of counterfactual\nreasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual\nreasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on\nin-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data\ndiversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More\ninterestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that\nTransformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing\npreliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation.

Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic\nalignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing\nstrategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential\nsignals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward\nstronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency.\nExtensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency,\nand background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and\ncoherent video editing without inversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowDirector\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u76f4\u63a5\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u9000\u5316\uff0cFlowDirector\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ODE\u76f4\u63a5\u6f14\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFlowDirector\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowDirector\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However,\nanalyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in\nscale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,\nfact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a\ncrowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired\nmulti-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans\ndiverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around\n12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are\ninfluenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not\ndirectly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and\nactual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,\nrevealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static\nencyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess\nperformance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by\ntesting search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and\nconventional LLMs in search-intensive settings.

We open-sourced the dataset to support future\nresearch in this direction.

Leveraging over 15,000 annotated\nstreet-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA\nand P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1\nscore of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated\nresident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.\nBeyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:\nfor instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously\nreducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically\ncontingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of\narchitectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing\nthe limits of universal spatial heuristics.

This bias manifests as\noverreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues\nlike reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases\noriginate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model\nmiscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model\ngenerations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using\ncontrolled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which\npreference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this\npreference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high\nmiscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features\nonly show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =\n-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a\nstrong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely\non spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training\nmethod based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized\ncontrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration\nfrom 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,\nwhile maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted\ndebiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u8868\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u504f\u597d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CDA\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u572860%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u504f\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u572840%\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002CDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece39.4%\u964d\u81f332.5%\uff0c\u504f\u5dee\u5dee\u5f02\u4ece20.5%\u964d\u81f310.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The\nearliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require\na training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods\npossess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of\ntheoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to\nreturn to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve\nthe TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural\nnetwork models. In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are\nfirst generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and\nnoise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and\nthe micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour\nmodel. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a\ntwo-dimensional point cloud.

Inspired by our empirical\nobservation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are\ntwo essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this\nperspective, we propose Multimodal low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a\nmultimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal\ncharacteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by\nmodality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal\ninteraction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive\nexperiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text,\nvisual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2/3, Qwen2,\nQwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility\nof the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also\nconducted to fully asses our method.

To facilitate controlled experiments, we first\nintroduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person\nimages and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and\ncross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and\nevaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts\nlearned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists\nbetween recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,\nwe observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more\ncapable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case.

In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open\nGaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D\nreconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open\nGaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic\nconsistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are\ninitialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent\ninpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces\nbidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion\nmodel. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient\nand progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we\nestablish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and\ngenerative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes.

To train and evaluate this approach,\nwe introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to\ndate), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both\nChinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an\naverage of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content\nsuch as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter\nmodel surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL\n(72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on\nEnglish document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page\ndocuments significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for\nMinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The 3B model can be efficiently deployed\nfor inference on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a\nfundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while\nimproving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time\nframework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies\ncaused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images\nand (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object\ndefinition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs.\nambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1)\nSelf-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively\nconverts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs\nwhile maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between\nmedical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher\nadaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal\nrepresentations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without\nauxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five\npublic datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA\napproaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain\nscenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image\nsegmentation.

We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku\nagainst three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth\nFirst Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which\nhave been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning\ntasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without\nadditional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other\nmethods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with\nstronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with\nincreased compute budget.

Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images\nthrough an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures,\nallow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this\npaper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D\nscene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D\nscene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively\nlower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based\napproaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing\nthat 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and\nthe pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we\nobserve that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets.

It requires interpreting\nfine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital\ntext, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In\nsuch multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on\nselectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a\nrich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes\nmulti-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model\ncapabilities.

Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,\na dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks\nin multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United\nNations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS\nscenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to\ngenerate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000\nmeticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more\nthan 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant\nchallenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will\ninspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning\nabilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect\nknowledge across fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSSBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\uff08HSS\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u5ffd\u89c6HSS\u9886\u57df\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6807\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8STEM\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86HSS\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HSSBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b13,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8986\u76d66\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8620\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41MLLMs\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728HSSBench\u4e0a\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "HSSBench\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8MLLMs\u5728\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fde\u63a5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate\ncheckpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\\%$ zero-shot\nImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B.

With dense voxel labels, prior works\ntypically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying\neach voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric\ndiscriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent\nambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels:\nthe voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level,\nwhich is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first\nintroduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet\neffective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into\ninstance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an\ninstance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy\nprediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks:\noffset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D\nvolume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate\ndisentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific\nspatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we\ndeploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense\ndetection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6\ndirections) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed\noffsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the\nclassification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show\nthat VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features.

Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint.

Extensive evaluation on two clinically\nsignificant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving\nstate-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse\ndataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset\nfor brain tumor segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DM-SegNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ccMamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66SSM\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57283D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c1D\u5e8f\u5217\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528Mamba\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDM-SegNet\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u65b9\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4Mamba\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u548cMamba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Synapse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523085.44%\u7684DSC\uff08\u8179\u90e8\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\uff09\uff0c\u5728BraTS2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523090.22%\u7684DSC\uff08\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "DM-SegNet\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u53ccMamba\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
