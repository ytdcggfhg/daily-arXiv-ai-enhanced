However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,\nTransformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,\nallowing to combine different model families flexibly.

Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133\nusing VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor\naggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a\nholistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,\nleveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance\nholistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to\nintroduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation\ngeneration.

In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused\nRetrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from\nlong context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect\nto the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,\nlong-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and\neffective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as\nretrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting\nthe most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop\nreasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains\nover full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate\nQRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves\nstrong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as\nRankGPT.

This is achieved through the integration\nof an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for\nhigh-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in\ncontext-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct\nversatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a\npowerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.\nNotably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of\nto match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights\nto encourage further research and development in the community."}

This study\nintroduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables\nsynchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system\nsignals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming\nthe constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841\nmacro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,\nestablishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and\nconducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the\ndataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating\nthat integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting\nperformance.

Many different training approaches have been proposed to\nimprove the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In\ncomparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this\npaper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image\nand a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we\nextract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using\na VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining\nmatches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the\nindividual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder\nVLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL\ncompositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the\nperformance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential\nof inference-time techniques.

However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's\ngeneralist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code\nto serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on\nclosing the perception-to-action gap.

INRs\nrepresent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network\ntaking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel\nrepresentations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating\nimages using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end,\nwe study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image\nfrom its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with\nReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight\ndecay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this\nnon-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex\npenalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a\nsufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is\nexactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our\ntheory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of\nimages realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the\nperformance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom\nimages."}

Their ability to model the full data distribution\nhas opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative\nlearning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the\nclass-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to\nextracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify\nCanonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM\nfeatures preserve essential categorical information while discarding\nnon-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative\nsamples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the\ncore class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we\ndevelop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While\nthe student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers\ncore class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the\ntraining data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial\nrobustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals\ninstead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve\nnot just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that\ncan drive robust representation learning."}

This paper explores a self-supervised approach\nthat combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data\n(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,\nand planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free\njoint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset\ncomprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong\nperformance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something\nv2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7\nrecall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.\nAdditionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering\ntasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on\nTempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to\nrobotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world\nmodel, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the\nDroid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different\nlabs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.\nNotably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these\nenvironments, and without any task-specific training or reward.

Unlike conventional approaches that\npredict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by\nexplicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single\nautoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe\naction that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens\nare generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and\npreviously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a\nglobal-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained\nby the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA\nincorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token\nrepresentation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;\nreverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk\nmodeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial\ngeneralization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of\na visuo-motor policy.

Feed-forward scene\nreconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly\ncreate digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded\n3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking\ntasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D\ntracking methods."}
