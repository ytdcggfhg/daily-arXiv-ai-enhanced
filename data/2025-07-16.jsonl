This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives.

Between-person effects revealed an average\nnegative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the\npost level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social\napproval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on\nniche social media platforms."}

When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels.

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long\nvideo generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to\naccurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based\non the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an\neffective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and\nanswering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on\nexisting long video generation models and the foundation generation models.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human\njudgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability\nboundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression."}

However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,\ndividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination\nexperienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model.

However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images.

First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships.

To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse\nviews and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key\ninsight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling\nfocused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate\nartifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,\nensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.\nFurthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the\nreconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and\nchain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.\nTRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it\nconsistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based\nstate-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean\nabsolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,\ndespite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm\naccuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.\nCode and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/."}

We show that a quadrotor drone\nequipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and\nrotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without\ninertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural\nnetwork trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests\ndemonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network\nis capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight\ncontrol loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across\ndifferent environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.\nWhile networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best\nperformance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative\ngeneralization.

However, most\ncurrent approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to\ntask requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce\na novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically\ngenerates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of\nconstructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies\nthat boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond\nclassical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary\nmatrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable\nexploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using\nentanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define\nunconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per\nqubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and\nevaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified\n64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently\noutperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing\nconfigurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical\nmodel (~0.87) by over 5%.

To address this, we propose U-RWKV,\na novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)\narchitecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)\ncomputational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the\nDirection-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive\nSqueeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE).
