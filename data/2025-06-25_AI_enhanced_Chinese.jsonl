Clinicians visually\nevaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score\nbased on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired\nby the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we\nexplore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction.

With the proposed layer-level teacher\nforcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training\ndifficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the\ndistilled 512$\\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards\n2048$\\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution\nfine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low\noverhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results\nalso justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for\ngenerating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future\nexploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aT2MD\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684Mamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563Transformer\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT2MD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eMamba\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cT2MD\u5728512\u00d7512\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u62102048\u00d72048\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "T2MD\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Mamba\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While current Transformer-based language\nmodels have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,\nthey often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work\ninvestigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised\nwithin the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a\ncomplete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based\nlanguage VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a\nsupporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The\nexperiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under\nexplicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -\ncan be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation\nresults in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior\nknowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the\nmodel to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on\nKey.

PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses\nperceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human\nvisual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is\ninterpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well\nsuited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM\non four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate\nthat it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high\ncompression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both\nstructured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool\nfor analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online\nplatforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u8bdd\u8bed\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u793e\u4f1a\u5a01\u80c1\uff08\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5ba3\u4f20\u548c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u5316\uff09\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7a81\u51fa\u65f6\u523b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\u3002", "method": "PRISM\u5728CIELAB\u8272\u5f69\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8272\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728BBC\u3001TVSum\u3001SumMe\u548cClipShots\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPRISM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5ba1\u6838\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u6216\u653f\u6cbb\u654f\u611f\u5a92\u4f53\u3002"}}

This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency\nof LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly\nup to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we\npropose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the\ngenerated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced\napproach to assess event commonsense.

Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency.

However, processing\nlong video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and\ncomputational costs.

To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare\ndiseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is\ncostly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC\nalgorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,\nexpert-created knowledge base.

However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the\navailability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.\nMoreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to\ndominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal\nfusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and\ngenomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,\nlimiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as\nmissing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a\nmultimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to\neffectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions\nbetween pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.\nIn addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned\npaired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete\nmodalities.

Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

We argue that\nanalyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to\nunderstanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution\nmethods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the\nmodel generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box\nmethod of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which\nidentified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention\nfrom all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal\nattribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by\nsuppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each\nfuture sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of\nthought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that\ndisproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought\nanchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an\nopen-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our\nmethods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods\nthat map how a model performs multi-step reasoning.

However, effective fusion remains challenging due to\ncross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as\nwell as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these\nproblems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework\nfor medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce\nconditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust\nmodality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)\nmodule, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined\narchitecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a\nmodality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into\nthe fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are\nproposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce\nFT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle\nnoisy medical tabular data efficiently.

However, the data\ncuration process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily\nrelies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated\nruntime environments to execute and validate unit tests.

Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation\nand 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like\nthe Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation\naccuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal\nthat integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature\nextraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional\nsupervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that\nHMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating\nits potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMSViT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89d2\u819c\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u5272\u548c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5468\u56f4\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DPN\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u5468\u56f4\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DPN\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd1\u534a\u6570\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHMSViT\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8aCCM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHMSViT\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5206\u5272\uff0861.34% mIoU\uff09\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0870.40%\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "HMSViT\u6027\u80fd\u5353\u8d8a\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u8bca\u65ad\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination\ndetection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to\nefficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model\ninference phase.

In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a\ncase-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal\nultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2\nmethod for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal\nultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,\nsegmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models\npretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines.

We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,\nand each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.\nIn Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future\nsteps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a\nverifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate\nany that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the\ntwo layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak\nspeedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other\nbenchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x\nwhile preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional\nGPU throughput.

Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative.

Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for\ncompressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.\nOur approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high\nfidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We\ndemonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel\nspatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),\nDeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis\ndata), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2\nimages), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,\nand 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,\nand 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb.

To address these challenges, we proposed\nSAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated\nthe need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism\nof SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via\na Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel\nPseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to\nautomatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction\nby guiding attention to relevant areas.

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is\nchallenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While\nvarious methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their\neffectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been\nsystematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from\nmonocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of\npinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical\nprojection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in\nclose-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal\nprojection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of\nadvanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D\nhuman pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the\nappropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance\nprediction quality.

However, existing solutions face\nseveral challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos\nwith rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene\ninteraction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive\ntraining. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used\nto predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain\nexperienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at\napproximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured\nbetween the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,\nstrain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08FLIR\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u810f\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u5fc3\u810f\u5e94\u53d8\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u810f\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DLNN\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "result": "FLIR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5e94\u53d8\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "FLIR\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5fc3\u810f\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In recent years,\nimages have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image\nrecognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image\ncompression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many\nexisting models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image\ncompression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully\ndesigning the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant\non their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently\nconsidered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and\ninterpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual\ncompression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding\nmethods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods:\nFeature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based\nScalable Coding (PR-ICMH).

This version has not been peer-reviewed", "summary": "The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI)\nis a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations\nof lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining\nreliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion\nvariability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,\nand is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large\nunlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the\nnuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.\n  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method\nthat learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based\nskeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from\nhealthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its\ndownstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with\nmetastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a\nstate-of-the-art SSL method.\n  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,\nachieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64.

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation\ntechniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,\nadapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,\nsemantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.\nConventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive\nmodifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss\naligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are\nconditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to\nthe new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as\nminimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the\nconditional distribution induced by the new conditions.

NeRF-based methods\nhave achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a\nlocal-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash\nencoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a\nsubset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all\nparameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash\nfeatures generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from\ndifferent subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different\ntraining steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated\ninconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,\nslower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate\nthe impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a\nNormalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the\nmismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)\nstrategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the\nglobal mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural\nnetwork exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster\nconvergence and enhanced reconstruction performance.
