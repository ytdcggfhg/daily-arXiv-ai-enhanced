Our approach leverages deep learning-based\nfacial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality\nfacial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement\nmodule, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in\nsurveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,\ndemonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity\nand model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial\nanalysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,\nleading to fairer and more reliable security applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5bfc\u81f4\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14AI\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u80a4\u8272\u548c\u906e\u6321\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9762\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6216\u906e\u6321\u9762\u90e8\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CelebA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11AI\u9762\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a\nReasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \\textbf{RARL}, that enhances\nthe reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and\nadaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight\nbase model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward\nfunctions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.\nTraining is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate\nthe model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and\nexplanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves\nVLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming\nsupervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while\nrequiring fewer computational resources.

To study this problem, we propose\nPrecise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models\nto generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short\nself-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any\nunsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests\na model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting\nthat requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We\npresent PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,\nsummarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are\nsupplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range\nof open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,\nstate-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs.

Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local\ngeometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural\nmodeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:\nSAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target\nand the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry\nand adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural\nconsistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed\nin different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of\ntarget directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a\ntwo-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.\nSpecifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real\nSAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical\nstructures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are\nintegrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images.

However, when applied to\nCamouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical\nissues: 1) \\textit{\\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text\nprompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic\ncaptions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)\n\\textit{\\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in\ngetting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global\nbackground sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,\ncausing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we\npropose \\textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework\nthat synergizes \\textbf{R}egion-constrained \\textbf{D}ual-stream\n\\textbf{V}isual \\textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \\textbf{M}ultimodal\n\\textbf{S}tepwise \\textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT\nprogressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,\nwhile RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently\nsamples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively\nmitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any\ntraining or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation\nresult on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than\nprevious methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.\nThe codes will be available at\n\\href{https://github.com/ycyinchao/RDVP-MSD}{https://github.com/ycyinchao/RDVP-MSD}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRDVP-MSD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff08RDVP\uff09\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08MSD-CoT\uff09\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6d88\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f2a\u88c5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "RDVP-MSD\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However,\nsystematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and\nresist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs\nby tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial\ndialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ\nrepetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven\ncomprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly\ninstructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and\nRepetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no\n``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance\nheavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these\nobservations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference\noptimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by\nleveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference\npairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive\npsychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select\noptimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while\nmaintaining general capabilities.

To address this issue, a defense strategy named\nKNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and\nnearest-neighbor search in feature space.

In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task\nlearning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically\noptimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate\nauxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text\ndetection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a\nconvolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,\nand hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic\nweight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of\neach loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon\nthe SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for\nsingle-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and\nreal-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach\nimproves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while\npreserving overall image fidelity.

Most existing methods,\nhowever, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and\ncross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have\nadopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with\nmuch reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More\nconcretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant\ninformation loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,\npoints can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing\nflat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we\npresent a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and\nsparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a\nquery-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned\nin the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,\nwhich enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The\noutputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo\nbenchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo.

However, their\neffectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent\ndiscrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the\ngeneral domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical\nlimitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)\nheightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation\nprocesses, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data\ncuration procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data\nnot only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and\ngeneral-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual\nquestion answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a\nmultimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the\ncurated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu\nundergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its\ntask-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the\npotential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm\nto enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability.

Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nenhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating\nmultiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure\nand assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a\nnovel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel\nagents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and\ninductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a\nformal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief\npropagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence\nscores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final\nanswer.

The simple decoder fails to capture and learn\nthe semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized\nobjects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between\nforeground and background pixels.

To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy\nOptimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key\ninnovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive\nor negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual\nutility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.\nBuilding on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size\ngeometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary\nconstruction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric\nbenchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models\nconsistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement\nof 4.29% across all benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6GCPO\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578b\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bGeometryZero\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002GCPO\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u9020\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)\uff0c\u5305\u542bGroup Contrastive Masking\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3GeometryZero\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "GeometryZero\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53474.29%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GCPO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6784\u9020\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we\ncall ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across\nmultiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a\nquestion correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is\ntrained to admit \"I am unsure\". But there are two key factors that make the\ntraining highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt \"answer only\nif you are confident\" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which\nhallucination remains high as 15%-25%.

We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average\nPrecision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and\ncharacter-level accuracy for text.\n  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and\nrecognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate\nrecognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.\nFANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition\nchallenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and\nannotation to support reproducibility and extension.

Generative Face Video\nCoding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could\ncharacterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream\ncompactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models\nto reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at\nthe decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable\nhigh-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far\nsurpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)\nstandard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of\nGFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,\nsystematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and\nindustrial standardization.

In addition, we\nconstruct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective\nMean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the\nmost appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the\nGFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a\nlow-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future\npractical deployments and applications.

In this context, feature coding, which\ncompresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for\nscenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this\ncompression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is\nnotoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,\nthis paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality\nAssessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed\nfeatures. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,\ncomprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from\nthree vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are\nprovided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics.

Relying on manual delineation introduces\nsignificant errors and is time-consuming.

Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated\nbasic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided\nstep-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative\nanalysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all\nconditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced\nperformance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across\nmodels.

Despite recent progress in SLG, existing\nmethods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic\naccuracy.

This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language\nand lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered\nsign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nGLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level\nconditioning.

This\nenables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and\nword-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for\nfine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,\nwe introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),\nto efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided\nby the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps.

PolitiSky24 was\ncreated using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information\nretrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with\nsupporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach\nachieves 81\\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in\npolitical stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and\nuser-level perspective.

Specifically, we\npropose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous\ntext-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:\nuncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include\ncommonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates\npair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL\nhierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive\nlearning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained\nrelationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the\ntext-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the\ninherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often\ncontains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the\ntext-frame level.

Animating existing 3D assets,\ninstead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the\ninput's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion\nmodel that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce\nmesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets\nleverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing\n3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,\ntransformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple\nlatent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated\nresults. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly\nproduce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with\nmodern rendering engines.

In this paper, we propose\nTreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and\nbidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of\nreview questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into\nfine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively\naggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we\nincorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by\ngenerating follow-up questions when needed.

Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated\npromising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization\nmethods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this\npaper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via\nmixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization\nbit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts\n(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency\ncaused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE\nmethod, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a\nlightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive\nloss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,\nwe introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to\nfurther reduce the inference overhead.

We introduce a deterministic\npipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks\nwithout relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination\nissues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach\ngenerates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term\nTF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by\nmeasuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct\ndomain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with\nlow computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple\nmodels (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we\ndemonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated\nbenchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than\ntraditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens\nrapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to\ndomain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.\nBy extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that\ninitial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while\nlater layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during\nadaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction\nhappens and is amplified in later layers.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method,\nreferred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can\ngenerate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift\nthe challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by\nleveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes\neach private image into a concise textual description using image to text\nmodels, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP\ntext, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI\nrequires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less\nthan or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private\nEvolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less\nthan or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine\ntuning baselines.

However,\nexisting H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations\nbetween cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL\nfirst decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB\nstaining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,\nrespectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,\nCCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and\nmeasures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features\nof the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,\nare also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's\nfeature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.\nAdditionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density\nmaps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and\nintensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,\nSSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,\ndemonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates\nhigh-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated\npathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCCPL\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3H&E-to-IHC\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709H&E-to-IHC\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\u4e0e\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u7684\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "CCPL\u5c06HER2\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\u67d3\u8272\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aHematoxylin\u548cDAB\u67d3\u8272\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528Gigapath\u7684Tile Encoder\u63d0\u53d6\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u8de8\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u786e\u4fdd\u67d3\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCCPL\u5728PSNR\u3001SSIM\u3001PCC\u548cFID\u7b49\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u53ca\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CCPL\u4e3a\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u67d3\u8272\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While effective for large models, we\nidentify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language\nmodels (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience\nsignificant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the\nQwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is\nwidespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT\nexamples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.\nStrikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even\ntraining on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original\nperformance prior to fine-tuning.

Recently,\nmulti-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale\npretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different\nmodalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal\ninteractions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with\ndiversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding\nNetwork (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct\ninteractions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the\nfoundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained\nencoders as \"super neurons\" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association\n(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based\non knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a\nrecursive manner.

However, their ability to attend to truly critical\ninformation during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the\npace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting\npatterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing\nthese patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation\nquality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training\ndata, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal\ninstruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant\nreasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead\nand, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses.

We cannot simply compare two LLM\noutputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor\ncan we compare the entire output distribution due to computational\nintractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,\nthey focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or\nfairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a\nframework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist\nhypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output\ndistributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte\nCarlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional\nassumptions.

The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with\nlow-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this\nresearch. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose\nthe SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power\nmonocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will\ngenerate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared\nwith the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,\ninspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose\na cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature\nrepresentation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated\nfiltering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the\nspeed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can\nmaintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection\nperformance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,\nthe proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,\nModerate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by\nAP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively.

Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual\nreasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a\nstep-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and\nexecute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with\nexecution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the\ntask planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to\ngenerate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning\ntask. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the\ncomposition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence\nreasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we\nimprove the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving\nlogic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM\nhallucinations.

Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to\ncapture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a\nshared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using\nthis framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain\nworkers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks\nspanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological\ncapability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation \"Green Light\"\nZone, Automation \"Red Light\" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.\nThis highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.\nMoving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse\nHAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for\nhuman involvement.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based\nMamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image\nrestoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the\nmodel's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a\nCLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with\nCLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal\nfeature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various\ndegradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies\nand fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that\nintegrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range\nmodeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative\noptimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,\npreserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we\nintroduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances\nglobal modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention\nto degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient\nand precise restoration.

Unlike standard cameras, which suffer\nfrom high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide\nhigher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater\nrobustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short\ntime window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game\nsequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized\nwith sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our\nsystem leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to\nprocess only events in the viewer's fovea.

These capabilities enable\nsystems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and\nsurrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal\nand multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently\nheterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and\nsettings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or\nhead-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard\nsupervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera\nmotion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video\npose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal\nfoundation models.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal\ntokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from\ntemporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for\negocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across\ndiverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,\negocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric\nvideo. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric\nvideo synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist\nmodels while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source\nEgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research.

This inheritance\ncreates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even\nillegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored\nexplicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our\nmethod requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a \"safe\"\nand an \"unsafe\" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their\nper-layer latent differences produces a \"refusal vector\", which, once\nsubtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We\nintroduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference\nof embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target\nconcept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus\npreserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the\nmodel's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the\noriginal training data.

To address this, we propose\nSelf-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an\nattacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast\nsafety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates\nbetween attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and\nsafeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This\nenables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of\nzero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the\ndesign of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the\ndefender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.\nEmpirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared\nto attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on\nsafety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained\nagainst static attackers.

To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for\ncompositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial\ncapabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities.

These limitations could be more severe for\nmodels with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as\nadaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic\nresource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a\ncybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a\nController. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and\ncollects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the\ncontroller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate\nfeedback to guide the next round.

It tackles challenges in open\nlong-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of\nstate-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve\nthese goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development\nand conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting\nlung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT\n2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45\ndisease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a\nnew focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the\nprevious event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed\nclassification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a\nmanually annotated \"gold standard\" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization\nto five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of\nCXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating\nstate-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare\ndisease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and\nzero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded\ndataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical\nsettings, offering a valuable resource for future research.

However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models\nlike FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and\ngenerated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of\nMM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token\nimbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of\ntimestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address\nthese issues, we propose \\textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention\n(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal\ninteractions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.\nWhen combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image\nalignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.\nWe tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating\nits ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,\nattribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in\ntext-to-image diffusion models.

To address this, we propose\nUA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online\nobject completion specifically designed for partial references.

Unlike\ntraditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER\nintegrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring\nverbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence\ndecision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived\ninsights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration\nfacilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.\nWe benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves\nexploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,\ngoal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven\ndecision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge\nfor operational success.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLUCIFER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc7\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "LUCIFER\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLUCIFER\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LUCIFER\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The\ncollection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the\nrelationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular\nstate. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive\nlearning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that\naligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,\nthe application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to\nsubstantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to\nnatural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of\nperturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent\nspace. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a\ncross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages\npre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to\nbetter capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image\nembeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing\nperturbations.

This study aimed to develop and benchmark\nmachine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in\ncommunity-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A\nnew set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was\nintroduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine\nlearning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem\nformulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular\nsensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly\ndetection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the\nTechnology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly\navailable dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,\ncomprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most\neffective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the\ncurrent 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.\nIncorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation\nhistory, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720\nand AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work\npresents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques\nfor agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using\nprivacy-preserving sensor data.

To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each\niteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling\nrelies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by\nelectrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,\nresulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions.

Traditional on-board\nperception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,\nwhile cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them\nunsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in\ndynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative\nframework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that\nleverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,\nmulti-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key\nalgorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and\nVariable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data\nfrom multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where\nindividual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting\nmechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data\nfrom multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in\nreal-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We\ndevelop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped\nrobotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of\nimproved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional\nsingle-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,\nedge-driven real-time processing.

The project page is https://mslmaps.github.io/", "summary": "Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage\npretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event\ndescriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment\nmapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional\nmodality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal\nspatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained\nmultimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these\nmaps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our\nmaps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to\naudio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When\ncombined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural\nlanguage commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., \"in between the\nsofa and TV\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across\ndifferent robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.\nBuilding upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a\nunified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues\nthrough the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.\nThis enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or\naudio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation.

Most existing methods assume that all\nqueries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric\ncosts; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may\ntrigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly\nthan others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative\nvariant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and\nAsymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution\nto favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes.

In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep\ngenerative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and\nnormalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model\njudiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial\nattention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,\ncorresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective\nnuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information.

Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to\nimprove its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization\nand neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing\narray that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a $\\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and\nHilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves\nrendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\\sim27.8\\times$ and energy\nsavings of $28.8\\sim51.4\\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes.

The primary challenge\narises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by\nsparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing\nmethods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not\ngeneralize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \\textbf{MapBERT},\na novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen\nspaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps\naligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first\ntime, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact\nbitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer\nmissing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.\nTo enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking\nstrategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with\nlearnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object\nembeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more\neffectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical\nrobotic tasks.

In this paper,\nwe present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general\npipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS\nrepresentations by reducing neural inference through two complementary\ntechniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that\nidentifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene\nreconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that\nimproves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.\nSecond, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters\nGaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation\nper group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our\ntechniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\\times$, reduce model size by\n$7.71\\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.\nSpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\\times$ and $58.23\\times$ on\nthe D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets.
