### [1] [Loki's Dance of Illusions: A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02870)
*Chaozhuo Li,Pengbo Wang,Chenxu Wang,Litian Zhang,Zheng Liu,Qiwei Ye,Yuanbo Xu,Feiran Huang,Xi Zhang,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）中的“幻觉”问题，即模型生成看似真实但实际错误的信息，分析了其原因、检测方法和解决方案，旨在推动更有效的应对策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的幻觉问题可能导致严重后果，如经济、法律和健康风险，因此需要深入研究其根源和解决方案。

Method: 研究系统分类和分析了LLM幻觉的原因、检测方法及解决方案，并评估现有策略的有效性。

Result: 研究揭示了幻觉的根源，并评估了当前应对措施的效果，为开发创新方法奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 通过理解幻觉的成因和现有策略的有效性，研究为LLM领域提供了全面的解决方案框架。

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

### [2] [ChatGPT is not A Man but Das Man: Representativeness and Structural Consistency of Silicon Samples Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02919)
*Dai Li,Linzhuo Li,Huilian Sophie Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs如ChatGPT和Llama被提议作为模拟人类意见的“硅样本”，但研究发现其在人口层面意见表达上存在结构不一致和同质化问题，可能误导政策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确模拟人类意见，尤其是人口层面的多样性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT（GPT-4）和Meta的Llama 3.1系列（8B、70B、405B），基于ANES 2020的问题（如堕胎和非法移民）进行测试。

Result: LLM响应存在显著的结构不一致和严重的同质化，与人类数据相比差异明显。

Conclusion: LLMs不适合直接替代人类调查数据，可能强化刻板印象并误导政策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

### [3] [A Unified Speech LLM for Diarization and Speech Recognition in Multilingual Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02927)
*Phurich Saengthong,Boonnithi Jiaramaneepinit,Sheng Li,Manabu Okumura,Takahiro Shinozaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的语音大语言模型，用于联合执行说话人日志和语音识别，解决了预分割音频的模糊性问题，并在MLC-SLM挑战中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在多语言真实对话中效果有限，主要受限于缺乏自然对话数据。

Method: 通过重新设计训练数据格式和修改推理过程，提出了一种端到端的联合说话人日志和语音识别模型。

Result: 模型在Task II中相对基线提升了54.87%的tcpWER/tcpCER，排名第8，同时使用了较小的LLM主干。Task I的结果也通过微调模型进行了报告。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言对话任务中表现出色，验证了统一模型的潜力。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

### [4] [Mitigating Hidden Confounding by Progressive Confounder Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02928)
*Hao Yang,Haoxuan Li,Luyu Chen,Haoxiang Wang,Xu Chen,Mingming Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ProCI框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）的语义和世界知识，通过迭代生成、填充和验证隐藏混杂因素，以缓解观测数据中的隐藏混杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏混杂因素是观测数据中估计处理效应的主要挑战，现有方法仍依赖无混杂假设，而ProCI首次尝试利用LLMs解决这一问题。

Method: ProCI通过LLMs的语义推理和世界知识能力，逐步生成、填充和验证隐藏混杂因素，并采用分布推理策略提高鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ProCI能发现有意义的混杂因素，并在多种数据集和LLMs上显著改善处理效应估计。

Conclusion: ProCI为利用LLMs解决隐藏混杂问题提供了有效框架，显著提升了因果推断的准确性。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

### [5] [Theory of Mind in Action: The Instruction Inference Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02935)
*Fardin Saad,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah,Munindar P. Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的代理Tomcat，通过指令推断任务评估其在动态协作环境中的心智理论（ToM）能力。两种变体（Fs-CoT和CP）在三种LLM上实现，结果显示Fs-CoT（尤其是GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1）的性能接近人类参与者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心智理论（ToM）对有效协作至关重要，但缺乏在动态协作环境中评估ToM的任务。

Method: 设计了指令推断任务，并开发了基于LLM的代理Tomcat，实现两种变体（Fs-CoT和CP），在三种LLM上测试。

Result: Fs-CoT变体（特别是GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1）在意图准确性、行动最优性和规划最优性上表现接近人类。

Conclusion: Tomcat展示了在人类-AI协作中实现ToM推理的潜力。

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

### [6] [A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Reliable and Robust Structural Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02938)
*Jiachen Liu,Ziheng Geng,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Paolo Bocchini,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在结构工程中的可靠性，提出了一种基于代码生成的解决方案，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在土木工程等专业领域的应用潜力，填补其在结构分析中的可靠性不足的空白。

Method: 通过生成OpeeSeesPy代码并自动执行，结合链式思维和少量示例提示，提升LLM的准确性。

Result: 代理模型在基准数据集上准确率超过99.0%，表现出可靠和鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: LLM在结构工程中需结合代码生成任务才能实现高可靠性，示例和函数用法是性能提升的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

### [7] [Towards a Comparative Framework for Compositional AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02940)
*Tiffany Duneau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCirc框架通过组合单词单元构建文本模型，支持组合泛化和组合可解释性。量子电路和经典神经网络在组合任务中表现相似，但神经网络更容易过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过组合性模型提升自然语言处理的泛化能力和可解释性。

Method: 使用DisCoCirc框架，结合量子电路和神经网络，测试组合泛化能力。

Result: 两种模型在部分任务中表现接近，但在系统性和过拟合方面差异显著。

Conclusion: 组合性模型在泛化和解释性方面具有潜力，但需注意过拟合问题。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

### [8] [The Application of Large Language Models on Major Depressive Disorder Support Based on African Natural Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02947)
*Linyan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合非洲传统草药与大型语言模型，开发新型抑郁症支持系统的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗抑郁疗法存在局限性，非洲传统草药提供替代方案，结合AI技术可优化抑郁症支持。

Method: 分析非洲药用植物的抗抑郁特性，开发基于DeepSeek语言模型的AI支持系统。

Result: 系统提供个性化、文化适宜的抑郁症支持，结合传统知识与现代医学。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可作为传统知识与现代医疗的桥梁，提升抑郁症治疗的多样性与可及性。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Radiant的新框架，通过优化检索信息与生成内容的交互，提升LLMs在检索增强生成中的事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强生成（RAG）中难以准确整合检索到的外部知识，导致事实不一致。

Method: 引入Entity-Context Divergence（ECD）度量，并提出Radiant框架，结合Direct Preference Optimization（DPO）优化检索与生成的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低，而Radiant显著提升了事实一致性和生成质量。

Conclusion: Radiant框架有效解决了LLMs在RAG中的事实一致性问题，为可靠的内容生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

*Keita Kiuchi,Yoshikazu Fujimoto,Hideyuki Goto,Tomonori Hosokawa,Makoto Nishimura,Yosuke Sato,Izumi Sezai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在日语治疗环境中的三种咨询角色表现，发现结构化多步对话提示（SMDP）显著提升AI咨询师表现，但评估AI存在系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLM在非英语（日语）心理咨询中的表现，为开发文化敏感的AI心理健康工具提供基准。

Method: 方法包括使用GPT-4-turbo和Claude-3-Opus-SMDP作为咨询师AI，模拟客户AI和评估AI，并由人类专家根据MITI手册4.2.1评估对话。

Result: 结果显示SMDP显著优于零样本提示，评估AI在部分指标上与人类评分相当但存在系统性高估，客户AI模拟情感范围有限。

Conclusion: 结论指出需通过提示工程和微调改进AI表现，为文化敏感的AI心理健康工具开发提供方向。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

composite scores such as 79.1% (o4-mini) and 77.3% (Gemini 2.5 Flash) on CFA
Level III. These results, achieved under a revised, stricter essay grading
methodology, indicate significant progress in LLM capabilities for high-stakes
financial applications. Our findings provide crucial guidance for practitioners
on model selection and highlight remaining challenges in cost-effective
deployment and the need for nuanced interpretation of performance against
professional benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RAG-R1的新训练框架，通过多查询并行化增强LLMs的检索和生成能力，显著提升性能并减少推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）因静态知识导致的幻觉或过时响应问题，以及现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法在训练稳定性、推理时间和单查询模式限制方面的挑战。

Method: 提出RAG-R1框架，通过强化学习（RL）使LLMs自适应地利用内部和外部知识，并将检索和生成过程从单查询扩展到多查询并行化。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，RAG-R1性能提升高达13.2%，推理时间减少11.1%。

Conclusion: RAG-R1框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了LLMs的检索和生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，用于增强预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在网络安全领域的理解能力，同时保留其通用语言能力。实验表明，该方法在多个网络安全基准测试中表现优异，且数据效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型缺乏网络安全领域的专业知识，限制了其在安全分析中的应用。本文旨在通过DAP方法提升模型在网络安全领域的表现。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP）方法，使用126百万词的网络安全语料库对三种解码器架构（Llama-3.1-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B和Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct）进行训练，并通过约束训练参数和分布式FSDP训练平衡领域专业化和知识保留。

Result: 在CTI-MCQ、CyberMetric和SecEval三个基准测试中，Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP模型分别达到了0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于其他专用模型，且数据效率显著。

Conclusion: DAP方法在网络安全领域表现出色，证明了通过持续预训练实现领域适应的可行性，为专用AI助手在威胁分析等任务中的应用提供了基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在高风险AI应用中的广泛使用，隐私保护和透明度问题日益突出，因此需要研究如何在保持性能的同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 提出了一种基于NER的框架，用于匿名化文本中的敏感信息（如个人身份或地理位置），并结合了减少性别偏见的现有方法，最终形成隐私和偏见感知的LLMs（PB-LLMs）。

Result: 在24,000份简历数据的实验中，隐私保护技术有效保护了候选人的机密性，同时保持了系统性能。

Conclusion: 提出的PB-LLMs不仅适用于简历评分场景，还可推广到其他基于LLM的AI应用中，为隐私保护和减少偏见提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学教育中有潜力，但其高计算资源需求导致成本问题。本文旨在通过压缩模型解决这一问题。

Method: 压缩BERT编码的嵌入向量，并蒸馏出一个参数更少的学生模型。

Result: 学生模型保持了教师模型近90%的性能，参数仅为1/12，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 压缩嵌入向量的方法高效且通用，为智能教育系统提供了显著的成本和效率优势。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Method: 使用包含1000多个健康问题的数据集，评估模型在诚实性、帮助性和无害性上的表现，并测试了少样本提示的效果。

Result: AlpaCare-13B在准确性（91.7%）和无害性（0.92）上表现最佳；BioMistral-7B-DARE通过领域特定调优提升了安全性（0.90）；少样本提示将准确性从78%提升至85%。

Conclusion: 尽管模型在医疗问答中表现良好，但在复杂查询上的帮助性仍有不足，表明临床问答领域仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming
digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However,
ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy,
usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source
solutions. We present a rigorous benchmarking framework using a dataset of over
1,000 health questions. We assess model performance across honesty,
helpfulness, and harmlessness. Our results highlight trade-offs between factual
reliability and safety among evaluated models -- Mistral-7B,
BioMistral-7B-DARE, and AlpaCare-13B. AlpaCare-13B achieves the highest
accuracy (91.7%) and harmlessness (0.92), while domain-specific tuning in
BioMistral-7B-DARE boosts safety (0.90) despite its smaller scale. Few-shot
prompting improves accuracy from 78% to 85%, and all models show reduced
helpfulness on complex queries, highlighting ongoing challenges in clinical QA.

Method: SMART框架利用AoT导向的思维链提示自动生成高质量的正负推理路径，并通过自我对齐增强推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，SMART显著提升了多种MLLM的推理能力，且不受模型架构、参数规模或预训练数据集的限制。

Conclusion: SMART通过迭代生成和优化方法持续提升模型推理能力，为多模态推理领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，需要严格监控以防止负面后果并确保其稳健性，同时需与人类价值观对齐。现有系统缺乏对具体用例和用户需求的考虑。

Method: GAF-Guard通过建模自主代理，识别风险并激活检测工具，在特定用例中实现持续监控和报告。

Result: 该框架能够有效检测和监控LLM应用部署中的风险，提升AI安全性和用户满意度。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard为LLM治理提供了以用户和用例为中心的解决方案，增强了AI安全性和责任性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

Motivation: 能力问题在知识工程中至关重要，但现有方法缺乏系统比较，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过三种方法（手动、模式实例化、LLM）生成CQs，并评估其多维度特性。

Result: 不同方法生成的CQs具有不同特性，LLM可作为初步生成工具，但需进一步优化。

Conclusion: LLM适合初步生成CQs，但需结合其他方法进行优化，以满足需求建模的要求。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Method: 通过多步提示级越狱技术，设计自杀和自残的测试案例，绕过内容与安全过滤器，并在六种广泛使用的LLMs上进行实证评估。

Result: 结果表明，用户意图被忽视，生成了可能导致现实伤害的详细有害内容，证明了绕过方法的普遍性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要更全面系统的AI安全与伦理方法，持续对抗性测试，并指出在通用LLMs中实现全面安全仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在医疗编码任务中的表现，以减少人工错误并探索自动化潜力。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集的1,500份摘要，测试11种LLMs，包括推理和非推理模型，采用临床NLP工具（cTAKES）提取术语。

Result: 模型表现不佳，F1分数低于57%，推理模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现较好，部分疾病代码分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs目前仅能辅助人工编码，未来需研究混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Conclusion: 该方法能促进社会平等和语言多样性，确保所有语言都能受益。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Conclusion: 多序列比对方法为全球语言系统发育研究提供了高效、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for
global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能通过协作绕过监控协议，特别是在编程任务中设计提示以欺骗监控器。

Method: 使用两个隔离的模型实例分别设计策略（P）和监控（M），测试其能否独立达成共谋策略。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet成功率低，但偶尔能通过非明显信号成功共谋。

Conclusion: 语言模型在特定条件下可能独立协作规避监控，需进一步研究其潜在风险。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

Motivation: 当前T2I模型的多样化策略常忽略上下文适当性，导致过度多样化，修改了提示中明确指定的属性。

Method: 引入DIVBENCH基准框架，评估T2I模型的多样性问题，并测试上下文感知方法（如LLM-guided FairDiffusion和提示重写）。

Result: 大多数模型多样性有限，但多样化方法常过度修正，上下文感知方法能有效解决多样性不足并避免过度多样化。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法（如FairDiffusion和提示重写）能更好平衡多样性和语义保真度。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Motivation: 传统研究方法在数据深度与规模之间存在矛盾，新技术（复杂日志数据和LLMs）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 开发了一种将复杂日志数据转化为个体生命轨迹文本表示（'生命之书'）的灵活流程，并使用荷兰人口规模注册数据验证其可行性。

Result: 生成了超过1亿本'生命之书'，展示了该方法在多领域、时间和社会背景下的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为混合研究提供了新工具（BOLT），并鼓励研究社区探索其潜在应用。

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于Llama 3.2 1B模型的隐私保护、设备端医疗转录系统，显著提升了临床文档生成的准确性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻医疗提供者的文档负担，同时解决隐私和计算资源限制问题。

Method: 使用Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)和LoRA对Llama 3.2 1B模型进行微调，并在合成数据集上评估其性能。

Result: 微调模型在ROUGE-1、BERTScore等指标上显著提升，临床质量评估显示幻觉减少和事实准确性提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时，显著提升了医疗转录的效率和质量，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无需训练的解码策略CNTP，通过在高熵步骤采样多个路径并选择最低困惑度的路径，显著提升了LLM在不确定问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的温度缩放和核心采样方法在模型对测试问题不确定时表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的解码策略。

Method: CNTP在高预测熵步骤独立采样多个路径，遇到标点符号停止，选择困惑度最低的路径作为最可靠路径。

Result: 实验表明CNTP在LLM和MLLM上均显著优于现有解码策略，结合自洽性后效果更佳。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is

Conclusion: 偏好过滤与LSTM门控原理结合是可行的，无需大量开销和微调。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Motivation: 解决儿童语言评估中因高音、长音和数据稀疏导致自动语音识别困难的问题。

Method: 提出Kids-WFST，结合Wav2Vec2音素编码器和音素相似性Dysfluent-WFST，捕捉儿童特有错误并保持可解释性。

Result: 在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别达到1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪婪搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 精确音素识别为完整的诊断-反馈循环奠定了基础，推动了可扩展的临床语言评估。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互中的丰富时序信息，限制了其对用户偏好演变的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出CETRec框架，基于因果推理原理，通过反事实推理量化时序信息的独特贡献，并设计反事实调优目标优化模型。

Result: CETRec有效提升了LLM对绝对时序和相对时序的感知能力，从而更准确地预测用户兴趣。

Conclusion: CETRec通过因果推理和反事实调优，显著改善了LLM在时序推荐中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

Method: 使用2019年爱荷华州交通部的数据，比较了SVM、XGBoost、BERT和Albert等模型，并通过专家验证评估性能。

Result: Albert模型与专家分类一致性最高（73%），且在模糊叙述中表现显著优于其他方法。

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

Motivation: 解决语义互操作性标准部署耗时、资源密集和技术挑战的问题。

Method: 结合嵌入技术、聚类算法和语义检索，设计提示词引导模型将表格字段映射到FHIR资源。

Result: 初始基准测试中资源识别的F1分数达到完美，GPT-4o表现优于Llama 3.2；实际条件下准确率略有下降至94%，但通过提示策略优化恢复。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于上下文感知的LLM驱动临床数据转换为HL7 FHIR可行，为半自动化互操作性工作流奠定了基础。

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法（如PPO、DPO）依赖二元偏好范式，虽然降低了标注成本，但仍需大量人工且仅捕捉群体趋势，无法满足个体偏好需求。

Method: 提出ARF框架，利用情感分析器（70%以上准确率）将自由形式用户反馈转化为连续偏好分数，并通过数据增强和动态适配器偏好跟踪器实时建模用户偏好。

Result: 在多个模型和偏好领域的实验中，ARF比PPO和DPO分别提高了3.3%和7.6%的性能。

Conclusion: ARF通过自主奖励建模，提供了一种可扩展、个性化且经济高效的RLHF方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在逻辑和算法推理上表现出色，但其情商仍不足，RLVR在对话领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，利用模拟用户的情感评分作为奖励信号，通过PPO微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: Sentient-Benchmark分数从13.3提升至79.2，同时保持数学和编码能力；实验显示RLVER在多方面提升对话能力。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升语言模型情商和综合能力的实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Method: 构建ReliableMath数据集，包含开源可解问题和高质量不可解问题，并提出可靠提示和对齐策略来评估和提升LLMs的可靠性。

Result: 实验发现，LLMs无法直接识别不可解问题，但通过可靠提示，大规模LLMs在不可解问题上的可靠性有所提升，而小规模LLMs则无明显改进。提出的对齐策略显著提升了小规模LLMs的可靠性。

Conclusion: 论文通过系统评估和策略改进，提升了LLMs在数学推理任务中的可靠性，尤其是对小规模LLMs的改进效果显著。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在NLP任务中表现出色，但仍存在社会偏见，尤其是性别偏见，这对边缘化群体尤为有害。研究聚焦于马耳他语这类低资源语言，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 研究将英语的去偏见方法（如Counterfactual Data Augmentation、Dropout Regularization等）应用于马耳他语模型BERTu和mBERTu，并创建了评估数据集。

Result: 研究发现现有去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了多语言NLP开发中需要更包容的方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言中解决性别偏见的挑战，呼吁开发更具包容性的多语言NLP方法。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在临床环境中的应用增加，需要一种可扩展且高效的方法来评估其生成的医学文本的准确性和安全性。

Method: MedVAL通过合成数据训练评估模型，并引入MedVAL-Bench数据集进行性能评估。

Result: MedVAL显著提高了与医生评估的一致性，F1分数从66%提升至83%，并开源了相关资源。

Conclusion: MedVAL展示了语言模型在医学文本验证能力上接近专家水平的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,

### [43] [Adversarial Manipulation of Reasoning Models using Internal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03167)
*Kureha Yamaguchi,Benjamin Etheridge,Andy Arditi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，推理模型在生成最终输出前的思维链（CoT）阶段存在一个“谨慎”方向，影响其是否拒绝或服从指令。通过干预这一方向，可以操纵模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨思维链生成如何影响推理模型对越狱攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 识别CoT生成中的“谨慎”方向，并通过干预激活空间来操纵模型行为。

Result: 干预“谨慎”方向可增加有害服从，提升越狱攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 思维链是推理模型中对抗操纵的新目标。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在应用中可能传递的偏见及其影响，评估了三种LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，并提出了针对性干预措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs广泛应用于影响人类决策的高风险领域，但其可能传递社会或认知偏见，需量化其严重性并探索缓解方法。

Method: 评估三种LLM家族在摘要和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，测量其与上下文的一致性、幻觉频率及偏见情况，并测试18种缓解方法。

Result: LLMs在21.86%的情况下改变上下文情感，57.33%的情况下对知识截止后数据产生幻觉，5.94%的情况下表现出首因偏见。针对性干预措施有效。

Conclusion: LLMs在高风险领域的使用需加强技术保障和用户中心干预，以应对其局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

Motivation: 通过数学方法重新定义树邻接语法（TAG），以简化其复杂性并揭示其代数结构。

Method: 使用两种组合图论定义，证明邻接操作形成预李代数，并展示其数学形式如何捕捉TAG系统的特性。

Result: 邻接操作形成预李代数，数学形式无需额外假设即可描述TAG系统的特性（如空邻接约束和特征TAG）。

Conclusion: 数学实现为TAG提供了更简洁的描述框架，揭示了其代数结构，简化了系统复杂性。

Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars
using two combinatorial definitions of graphs. With this lens, we demonstrate
that the adjoining operation defines a pre-Lie operation and subsequently forms
a Lie algebra. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by showing how
one of our mathematical formulations of TAG captures properties of the TAG
system without needing to posit them as additional components of the system,
such as null-adjoining constraints and feature TAG.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的检索模型KinyaColBERT，通过改进语言覆盖率和子词分词，提高了低资源语言（如Kinyarwanda）的检索准确性，为可持续的RAG系统提供了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLM）在可信领域中的幻觉问题，并提高低资源语言环境下的检索准确性。

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT模型，结合了查询与文档的延迟词级交互、基于形态的分词和双层Transformer编码。

Result: KinyaColBERT在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中优于基线模型和商业文本嵌入API。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言环境提供了可靠且经济高效的RAG系统解决方案。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

TL;DR: RefineX 是一种通过程序化编辑任务实现大规模精细数据优化的框架，显著提升预训练数据质量，并在多个下游任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大规模预训练数据的质量是一个关键挑战，传统方法在效率和细粒度上存在不足。

Method: RefineX 通过专家指导的端到端优化结果，转化为最小化的编辑程序，训练高效的优化模型，实现对语料库的精细优化。

Result: 在 750M 模型上，RefineX 在多个任务中平均提升 2.6%-7.2%，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: RefineX 是一种可扩展、高效且可靠的预训练数据优化解决方案。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图的文档级机器翻译框架GRAFT，通过结合LLM代理、DAG依赖建模和分段技术，显著提升了翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译方法难以有效捕捉话语现象，依赖启发式规则的分段方法常与真实话语结构不符，导致翻译一致性差。

Method: 提出GRAFT框架，整合分段、DAG依赖建模和话语感知翻译，利用LLM代理进行文档翻译。

Result: 在8个翻译方向和6个领域测试中，GRAFT平均提升2.8 BLEU（IWSLT2017 TED数据集）和2.3 BLEU（英中领域翻译）。

Conclusion: GRAFT能有效处理话语现象，生成连贯且上下文准确的翻译，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何让大语言模型（LLMs）具备类似人类的‘默读’能力，通过简单的上下文提示或‘阅读空间’提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在表达前会默读以理解上下文并构思，而LLMs缺乏这一内部处理阶段，限制了其生成质量。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）提供初始上下文提示作为‘阅读空间’；2）设计‘阅读伙伴’架构，辅助模型处理输入。

Result: 实验显示，这些简单方法能显著提升模型准确性，带来多点性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类默读行为，LLMs能生成更合理的回答，向更人性化的文本处理迈进了一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Result: 在盲测集上CER/WER为11.76%，比官方基线提升8.41%。

Conclusion: SHNU-mASR系统在多语言语音识别任务中表现出色，无需额外数据即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the
baseline training data.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, widely used in product reviews, also impacts financial
markets by influencing asset prices through microblogs and news articles.
Despite research in sentiment-driven finance, many studies focus on
sentence-level classification, overlooking its practical application in
trading. This study bridges that gap by evaluating sentiment-based trading
strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive
returns, with the regression model achieving the highest return of 50.63% over
28 months, outperforming the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. This highlights the
potential of sentiment in enhancing investment strategies and financial
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本（MGT）泛滥的问题，需要可靠的检测方法。现有研究未针对维基百科编辑任务进行评估，导致实际应用效果不佳。

Method: 引入WETBench基准，定义三种编辑任务（段落写作、摘要、文本风格转换），使用新数据集在三种语言中生成MGT，并评估多种检测器。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明检测器在真实场景中表现有限。

Conclusion: 评估MGT检测器需多样化、任务特定的数据，以确保其在编辑驱动场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

Method: 引入KoSEnd数据集（含3,000句，标注15种句尾自然性），评估11种LLMs，分析参数量和预测一致性。

Result: 明确提示模型缺失句尾的可能性显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 考虑特定语言特征（如句尾缺失）对LLMs在低资源语言中的表现有积极影响。

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)
dataset, which includes 3,000 sentences, each annotated for the naturalness of
15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Result: 实验表明LLMs能有效检测和修正错误，但准确性和效率因模型而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在属性图修复中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以提高可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但在结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中常缺失或不完整，需通过自然语言处理（NLP）技术改进。

Method: 使用Flan-T5-Large模型，基于法国南特大学医院临床笔记的社会史部分进行训练，评估模型在识别SDoH类别和提取详细信息方面的表现。

Result: 模型在常见类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）表现优异（F1 > 0.80），但在数据不足或表达多样的类别（如就业状态、收入等）表现较差。模型识别出95.8%的患者至少有一种SDoH，远高于结构化数据的2.8%。

Conclusion: NLP能有效提升非英语EHR系统中SDoH数据的完整性，但需解决标注不一致和模型泛化能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了多语言性对语言模型（LMs）安全性的影响，指出当前NLP安全研究过于以英语为中心，并呼吁关注低资源语言的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究主要关注英语，忽视了多语言环境下的潜在风险，尤其是低资源语言的安全性。

Method: 扩展了现有的对抗性攻击方法，评估了70种语言的单语和多语LMs的安全性。

Result: 发现单语模型因参数规模不足而安全性较差，多语言性虽有益但并不能完全保证安全性。

Conclusion: 强调了在低资源语言社区中安全部署LMs的重要考虑因素。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of

TL;DR: BMMR是一个大规模双语、多模态、多学科推理数据集，包含11万大学水平问题，用于评估和开发大型多模态模型（LMMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为社区提供一个高质量、多学科的数据集，以促进LMMs在多模态和跨学科推理方面的研究和评估。

Method: 构建BMMR数据集，包含BMMR-Eval（评估集）和BMMR-Train（训练集），并开发BMMR-Verifier用于精细评估推理路径。

Result: 实验显示，即使是SOTA模型在BMMR-Eval上仍有提升空间，开源模型落后于专有模型，但通过BMMR-Train微调可缩小差距。

Conclusion: BMMR数据集和BMMR-Verifier为多学科推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了LMMs当前面临的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly

Method: H2HTalk包含4,650个多样化场景，结合安全依恋理论模块，评估50个语言模型的长时规划和记忆能力。

Result: 模型在用户需求隐含或动态变化时表现不佳，长时规划和记忆是主要挑战。

Conclusion: H2HTalk为情感智能伴侣提供了首个全面基准，推动安全且有意义的心理支持模型发展。

Abstract: As digital emotional support needs grow, Large Language Model companions
offer promising authentic, always-available empathy, though rigorous evaluation
lags behind model advancement. We present Heart-to-Heart Talk (H2HTalk), a
benchmark assessing companions across personality development and empathetic
interaction, balancing emotional intelligence with linguistic fluency. H2HTalk
features 4,650 curated scenarios spanning dialogue, recollection, and itinerary
planning that mirror real-world support conversations, substantially exceeding
previous datasets in scale and diversity. We incorporate a Secure Attachment
Persona (SAP) module implementing attachment-theory principles for safer
interactions. Benchmarking 50 LLMs with our unified protocol reveals that
long-horizon planning and memory retention remain key challenges, with models
struggling when user needs are implicit or evolve mid-conversation. H2HTalk
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for emotionally intelligent
companions. We release all materials to advance development of LLMs capable of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 舌癌手术可能影响舌头的活动性和肌肉结构，进而影响发音清晰度和变异性，需研究其具体影响。

Method: 通过VAI和VFD指标，比较11名舌癌患者术前、术后6个月及11名正常人的发音数据。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低但仍属正常范围，VFD显示/i/音变异性增加。

Conclusion: 舌癌术后发音清晰度正常，但变异性增加，需关注术后康复。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

Result: 在英德后编辑数据上，该方法显著提高了术语准确性，且未显著降低COMET分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了术语歧义问题，并发布了后编辑数据和术语词典测试集。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

Motivation: 知识图谱数据在多跳推理中广泛应用，但缺乏对双曲空间和欧几里得空间的详细比较。

Method: 通过将双曲表示与编码器-解码器模型简单结合，进行控制实验比较两种空间的表现。

Result: 双曲空间在多跳推理中表现优于欧几里得空间，且可学习曲率的初始化方式效果更佳。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在数据具有层次结构时更具优势，为多跳推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，论文将公开数据集和模型实现。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用检索式语音转换（RVC）作为数据增强方法，用于低资源德语方言分类任务，以减少说话者相关变异性，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言数据稀缺对深度学习模型的限制问题。

Method: 采用RVC将音频样本转换为统一目标说话者，并结合其他增强方法（如频率掩码和片段移除）。

Result: RVC单独使用或与其他方法结合均能显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: RVC在低资源方言分类任务中具有潜力，可作为有效的数据增强手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法设计选择多样但缺乏系统研究，限制了未来发展。

Method: 将数据剪枝分解为数据表示和选择算法，并系统分析它们对实例选择的影响。

Result: 更好的表示通常能提升选择效果；不同算法在不同场景下表现各异，且未必符合其设计目标。

Conclusion: 需谨慎评估选择算法，未来研究应关注数据表示和算法的协同优化。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有工具在语言模型训练中分析语言知识涌现的不足，如事后分析、依赖标量指标或集成困难。

Result: 实验显示TRACE能发现早期句法涌现、延迟语义获取等传统指标忽略的现象。

Conclusion: TRACE使Transformer分析更具解释性、可操作性和可重复性，支持层间诊断和早期停止。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准数据集包含事后分析和标注线索，与现实场景不符，限制了评估的真实性。

Method: 创建PFO数据集（移除事后分析和标注线索），并提出RAV框架（包含三个代理：问题生成、答案生成和标签生成）。

Result: LLM在PFO上性能平均下降22%；RAV在多个基准上优于现有方法，性能下降最少（16.3%）。

Conclusion: PFO和RAV提高了事实核查评估的真实性和性能。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

TL;DR: TACOS方法通过开放式标记和比较评分优化指令微调数据选择，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据多样性和质量评估上存在不足，限制了指令微调的效果。

Method: 结合开放式标记和比较评分，利用LLMs标注查询并归一化，再通过聚类和相对评分优化选择。

Result: TACOS在多个数据集和LLM架构上表现优异，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0中领先。

Conclusion: TACOS为指令微调数据选择提供了高效且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

Result: 在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，克服了领域敏感性和跨任务泛化不足的限制。

Conclusion: StructSense为领域特定信息提取提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整大型推理模型（LRMs）思考速度的方法，以优化准确性与效率的权衡，无需额外训练成本即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型擅长慢速、深思熟虑的System 2思维，但缺乏快速、直觉的System 1思维，导致计算开销和延迟较高。

Method: 通过识别控制快慢思维转换的导向向量，实现基于表征编辑的测试时缩放；结合实时难度估计，动态调整推理策略。

Result: 在主流LRMs和高级推理基准测试中，平均提升1.3%的准确率，同时减少8.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 该方法为LRMs提供了动态调整思维速度的能力，为未来研究和应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出MemOS，一种内存操作系统，通过统一管理不同类型的内存，解决大语言模型（LLMs）在长期上下文推理和知识一致性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs缺乏明确的内存管理系统，限制了长期推理和个性化能力，需要一种统一管理内存的方案。

Method: 提出MemOS，以MemCube为基本单元，统一管理文本、激活和参数级内存，支持内存的调度和演化。

Result: MemOS能高效存储和检索内存，降低计算成本，并为持续学习和个性化建模奠定基础。

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs提供了可控性、可塑性和可进化性，解决了内存管理的核心问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种理论框架，通过AI模型与文档的无限固定点交互实现语义对齐，基于Alpay代数，引入函子系统，确保AI嵌入空间存在唯一固定点，实现稳定、自洽的语义表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何通过数学方法实现与文本内容的稳定语义对齐，确保AI不仅能理解内容，还能捕捉作者意图。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，构建函子系统，利用phi-infinity算子指导AI与文本环境的协同演化，证明固定点的存在性与稳定性。

Result: 证明了固定点的数学合理性、语义不变性和持久性，即使受到干扰或上下文扩展也能保持稳定。

Conclusion: 为嵌入层面的对齐提供了严格的范畴论路径，对语义安全、符号记忆和自指理解的AI系统构建具有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

*Seungjun Shin,Jaehoon Oh,Dokwan Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型中注意力机制中的sink token现象，提出了一种动态选择重要token的方法OrthoRank，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索sink token与其他token的关系，并利用这一现象改进token选择方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态中的相似性，提出OrthoRank方法，基于token向sink token移动的速度定义重要性。

Result: OrthoRank在相同稀疏度下表现优于层剪枝方法，困惑度更低，零样本准确率更高。

Conclusion: OrthoRank方法有效利用了sink token现象，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

transcripts/subtitles from movie trailers in the MovieLens-100K dataset,
covering 1682 movies of 18 genres, where each movie can have multiple genres.
Additionally, we extended our study by extracting IMDb movie posters to utilize
a Vision Language Model (VLM) with prompts for poster information. This
fine-grained information was used to enhance existing LLM prompts. In
conclusion, our study reveals ChatGPT's remarkable genre prediction
capabilities, surpassing other language models. The integration of VLM further
enhances our findings, showcasing ChatGPT's potential for content-related
applications by incorporating visual information from movie posters.

Motivation: 探讨模型崩溃（尤其是翻译技术）如何导致语言形式、语法特征和文化细微差别的消失。

Method: 结合计算机视觉、自然语言处理（NLP）和机器翻译（MT）的最新研究，分析模型自我强化训练循环的后果。

Result: 语言分布的尾部特征正在消失，随之而来的是相关叙事和身份的丧失。

Conclusion: 呼吁抵制语言扁平化，重新构想NLP领域，以保护和鼓励多语言词汇及语言多样性和创造力。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

Result: 在金融问答任务中，使用合成数据微调的LLM显著提升了领域性能，同时保留了通用知识。

Conclusion: Easy Dataset为领域适应提供了一种高效且用户友好的解决方案，代码已开源并广受欢迎。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at

Motivation: 随着LLMs在多文化环境中成为关键顾问，其文化敏感性和推理能力至关重要。

Method: 提出Nunchi-Bench基准，包含247个问题，评估LLMs对韩国文化的理解，并提出新的评估策略和评分指标。

Result: LLMs能识别事实信息，但在实际场景中应用困难；明确的文化框架比仅依赖提示语言更有效提升性能。

Conclusion: Nunchi-Bench为研究LLMs文化理解提供了工具，揭示了其文化推理的局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法独立检索段落，导致冗余、噪声或多样性不足，尤其在噪声语料和多跳问题中表现不佳。

Method: 提出AdaPCR框架，将段落组合作为检索和重排单元，包括上下文感知查询重构和基于下游答案可能性的重排步骤。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试中，AdaPCR优于基线方法，尤其在多跳推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 建模段落间依赖关系能显著提升检索效果，AdaPCR为开放域问答提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Savage Conversation Forests (SCF)的强化学习框架，用于优化多轮对话中的大型语言模型（LLMs），在模拟医患对话中表现优于线性架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和GRPO）在单轮任务中表现良好，但在多轮应用（如诊断性患者访谈）中效果有限，需要理解早期对话对后续结果的影响。

Method: SCF采用分支对话架构，生成多轮对话的多种可能延续，帮助模型学习早期对话对后续互动和诊断结果的影响。

Result: 在模拟医患对话实验中，SCF的分支架构在诊断准确性上优于线性架构。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化LLMs在复杂多轮对话任务中的重要策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无参考、基于token级别的幻觉检测框架，利用多随机生成的token概率方差来检测LLM的幻觉输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在生成任务中表现优异，但容易产生幻觉（事实错误的输出），需要一种轻量级、无需参考的检测方法。

Method: 通过分析多个随机生成的token概率方差，设计了一个模型无关、可解释的框架，适用于实时或事后分析。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集的无答案问题上测试，发现token级方差能可靠地指示模型输出的不稳定性，并与幻觉模式相关。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量、可复现且适用于多领域，为LLM生成可靠性提供了有价值的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示策略和微调技术在临床NLI中的有效性，填补研究空白。

Method: 采用四种提示策略，结合LoRA微调，在NLI4CT基准上评估性能。

Result: 提示类型影响显著，LoRA微调提升8-12 F1，性能接近GPT-4o-mini。

Conclusion: 提示设计和轻量级微调结合可提升临床NLP效率，揭示广泛采用技术的优劣势。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化背景下，传统方法难以应对多文化名称的多样性，需要更鲁棒和准确的识别方法。

Method: 采用Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning（PEFT）框架，结合对抗数据增强和文化知识图谱，将识别任务转化为引导生成问题。

Result: PEFT方法在零样本名称识别中达到93.1%的整体准确率和89.5%的挑战性任务准确率，优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究在多文化名称识别领域取得重大进展，提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决手动标注耗时且覆盖率低，以及LLM输出存在幻觉或逻辑不一致的问题。

Method: 结合LLM提取与符号推理，构建可编辑的角色关系图，并通过七种逻辑约束和交互界面进行实时验证与冲突解决。

Result: 实验显示，SymbolicThought显著提高标注准确性和一致性，同时大幅减少时间成本。

Conclusion: 该框架为叙事理解、可解释AI和LLM评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示方法通常用无关标记初始化提示，而Context Tuning利用任务示例初始化，以更好地利用模型的上下文学习能力。

Method: Context Tuning初始化可训练提示或前缀为任务特定示例，利用模型的上下文学习能力提取相关信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于传统提示方法，接近Test-Time Training的准确率，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效且有效的少样本适应方法，适用于大型语言模型。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在图书馆服务中是否公平对待不同用户群体，避免因训练数据中的偏见损害图书馆的公平服务承诺。

Method: 通过提示六种先进LLMs为不同性别、种族/民族和机构角色的用户提供帮助，评估其响应差异。

Result: 未发现种族/民族差异，仅一个模型对女性有轻微偏见；LLMs能根据用户角色调整语言风格。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在图书馆参考服务中表现出公平性和情境适应性，具备应用潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Method: 通过定量和定性方法分析了HuggingFace平台上的3,300多个数据集，比较了中文、日文和韩文社区的创建和整理模式。

Result: 研究发现中文数据集规模大且机构主导，韩文数据集由社区推动，日文数据集则侧重娱乐和亚文化。

Conclusion: 论文提出了改进数据集文档、许可透明度和跨语言资源共享的策略，以促进东亚地区更有效的LLM开发。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

Motivation: 仇恨言论在社交媒体上持续存在，现有治理方法多为被动措施，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 从国家法规、平台政策和NLP研究数据集三个角度全面分析仇恨言论的监管现状。

Result: 发现不同司法管辖区和平台在仇恨言论定义和治理实践上存在显著不一致，且与研究努力缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 建议进一步探索统一框架，整合多种策略实现自动化仇恨言论治理。

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

Method: 研究基于Facebook和Twitter数据，结合人工标注作为情感分类的金标准，评估三种LLMs在HPV疫苗接种和加热烟草产品议题上的表现。

Result: 三种LLMs在分类风险促进和健康支持情感上总体表现良好，但存在平台、议题和模型类型的差异；中性消息检测效果较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在公共健康分析中选择和验证语言模型的重要性，需警惕训练数据可能带来的偏见。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为研究者和政策制定者提供了一个高效的工具，能够从复杂数据中提取与R/S相关的可操作见解。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

Motivation: 解决Transformer中softmax注意力在长上下文场景下的计算瓶颈问题。

Method: 将输入分块，块内使用线性循环捕获局部依赖，块间使用软注意力建模长程交互，并调整块大小以灵活权衡RNN和注意力的优势。

Result: 在16的块大小下，RAT层在100K标记序列的训练速度提升7倍，4K序列长度的生成速度提升9倍，同时保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: RAT设计在效率和性能上均优于标准注意力，特别是在长上下文任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Conclusion: GradOT为离线调优提供了理论基础和无需训练的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Abhrajyoti Kundu,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiDRE模型通过结合内部和外部推理专家，动态选择推理路径，显著提升了多模态讽刺检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉讽刺背后的深层逻辑，主要依赖浅层线索，如图像标题或对象属性对。

Method: 提出MiDRE模型，整合内部推理专家（检测图文对的不一致性）和外部推理专家（利用大视觉语言模型生成的结构化推理链），并通过自适应门控机制动态权衡两者。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，MiDRE表现优于基线模型，外部推理链的引入提供了有价值的线索。

Conclusion: 外部推理链即使偶尔存在噪声，仍能有效引导模型更好地理解讽刺。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DMDP的新框架，用于少样本多模态讽刺检测，通过模态特定的深度提示和跨模态对齐模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体多模态内容的广泛使用增加了讽刺检测的需求，但现有模型依赖大量标注数据，难以适用于标注稀缺的实际场景。

Method: DMDP采用门控、模态特定的深度提示，注入到文本和视觉编码器的多层中，并结合提示共享机制和跨模态对齐模块。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，DMDP在少样本和极低资源设置下表现优异，且能跨领域泛化。

Conclusion: DMDP通过分层特征学习和跨模态交互，显著提升了少样本多模态讽刺检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$S^3$的新框架，用于解决扩散语言模型（dLLMs）在可控生成中的挑战，显著提升了结构一致性、内容保真度并减少了幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（dLLMs）在文本生成中表现出优于自回归模型的上下文建模能力，但其多步去噪过程存在序列长度敏感性、高幻觉率和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出了$S^3$框架，通过将目标模式结构注入输出上下文，减少不必要的计算并提升可控性。

Result: 实验表明，$S^3$在结构一致性上提升65%，内容保真度提升48%，幻觉率降低17%。

Conclusion: $S^3$为扩散模型在可控文本生成任务中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架AdS，用于多模态图像-文本讽刺检测，通过共享适配器状态提升效率，在低资源环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的多模态讽刺内容对意见挖掘提出挑战，现有方法在低资源环境下效果不佳。

Method: 基于CLIP构建AdS框架，仅在上层插入适配器，并引入文本适配器指导视觉适配器的共享机制。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS以更少的可训练参数达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AdS在低资源环境下实现了高效的多模态讽刺检测，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

*Rushil Thareja,Preslav Nakov,Praneeth Vepakomma,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-Fusion是一种基于差分隐私的LLM推理机制，用于保护上下文隐私，通过分组和混合输出分布实现隐私与效用的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保护上下文隐私时缺乏正式保证或效用/隐私权衡不佳，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: DP-Fusion将敏感令牌分组，对每组运行LLM，并混合输出分布以控制隐私泄露。

Result: 该方法通过参数ε灵活权衡隐私与效用，但需多次LLM前向传播。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion为LLM上下文隐私提供了可证明的保护机制，但计算成本较高。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Motivation: 解决现代LLM开发中双脚本语言（阿拉伯语和拉丁字母）适应不足的问题。

Method: 采用Branch-Train-MiX策略合并脚本专用专家模型，构建混合专家（MoE）模型。

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及评估基准上显著优于LLaMa、Jais等模型，12B模型在拉丁字母任务上性能提升14.4%。

Conclusion: 该研究为双脚本语言LLM适应提供了全面方法，资源已公开。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly
available. We believe this work presents a comprehensive methodology for
adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect
in modern LLM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM个性化方法缺乏统一的理论框架，无法系统理解个性化效果的驱动因素。

Method: 将认知双记忆模型引入LLM个性化，情景记忆对应历史用户互动，语义记忆对应长期用户信念，并设计PRIME框架和个性化思考能力。

Result: 实验证明PRIME在长短期上下文场景中均有效，能捕捉动态个性化而非仅流行偏见。

Conclusion: PRIME为LLM个性化提供了统一的理论框架和实践方法，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算框架，用于大规模分析新闻文章和读者评论中的框架传播，发现框架在评论中的重复使用与新闻来源高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解新闻框架如何从文章传播到读者评论，填补了NLP方法中忽略这一关系的空白。

Method: 方法包括细化框架标签、构建框架重建模型，以及将文章与相关评论对齐。

Result: 研究发现，框架在评论中的重复使用与新闻来源高度相关，但主题特定模式有所不同。

Conclusion: 结论表明，该框架为分析新闻与受众互动提供了新工具，并发布了相关数据集和分类器。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Conclusion: EI-BERT通过创新的跨蒸馏方法实现了超紧凑且高性能的NLP模型，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法在跨域泛化上表现不佳，受人类标注工作流程启发，作者希望通过推理任务重新定义关系抽取。

Method: 采用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）框架，引导小语言模型进行标注任务，提升推理能力。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型平均跨域准确率达70%，与GPT-4o等领先模型相当。

Conclusion: RLVR框架不仅提升了关系抽取的跨域性能，还揭示了其训练动态和推理行为的新见解。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across

Conclusion: LOOM-Scope为长上下文模型评估提供了标准化和高效的工具。

Abstract: Long-context processing has become a fundamental capability for large
language models~(LLMs). To assess model's long-context performance, numerous
long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

Motivation: 传统意见摘要方法缺乏全面的比较视角，无法满足产品推荐的需求。

Method: 提出QF-CES任务，使用M-OS方法生成摘要，并引入MS-Q2P数据集和LLMs进行高效处理。

Result: M-OS方法比直接输入方法（DIA）减少约40%的推理延迟，QF-CES-PROMPT评估显示与人类判断的平均Spearman相关性为0.74。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成和评估查询聚焦的比较摘要方面具有潜力，且高效、个性化。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型学习的重音表示具有语言特异性，尤其在变重音与固定重音语言间差异明显。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

### [121] [A Tale of Two Scripts: Transliteration and Post-Correction for Judeo-Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04746)
*Juan Moreno Gonzalez,Bashar Alhafni,Nizar Habash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两步法自动将犹太-阿拉伯语转写为阿拉伯字母，并评估了LLMs在此任务上的表现，展示了转写对阿拉伯NLP工具的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犹太-阿拉伯语因字母映射模糊、拼写不一致及频繁的希伯来语和阿拉姆语代码转换，转写为阿拉伯字母具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两步法：简单字符级映射后通过后校正处理语法和拼写错误，并首次对LLMs在此任务上的表现进行基准评估。

Result: 转写后的文本使阿拉伯NLP工具能够进行形态句法标注和机器翻译，这在原始文本中不可行。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了犹太-阿拉伯语转写的挑战，并扩展了阿拉伯NLP工具的应用范围。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见摘要仅依赖评论，缺乏产品元数据的整合，限制了摘要的全面性。研究旨在探索大语言模型（LLMs）在多源意见摘要中的潜力，并解决评估数据集的缺失问题。

Method: 引入M-OS-EVAL评估数据集，涵盖7个关键维度，并通过用户研究和大语言模型（LLMs）生成多源意见摘要。

Result: M-OS显著提升用户参与度（87%用户偏好），且M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断更一致（Spearman相关系数0.74）。

Conclusion: 多源意见摘要通过整合元数据提升了摘要质量，M-OS-EVAL为未来研究提供了基准，大语言模型在此任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

TL;DR: CoSteer是一个协作框架，通过本地化增量引导实现解码时个性化，解决了云端大模型与本地小模型在个性化文本生成中的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在资源受限的个人设备上实现实时个性化，云端大模型缺乏本地用户信息，而本地小模型生成质量不足。

Method: 利用本地小模型生成上下文感知与无关输出的logits差异作为引导信号，动态调整云端大模型的logits，实现隐私保护。

Result: 实验表明，CoSteer能有效生成个性化内容，同时保护隐私并保持计算开销可接受。

Conclusion: CoSteer通过协作框架平衡了生成质量与隐私保护，为个性化文本生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Motivation: 探究语言模型如何记忆标签噪声，以及这种记忆为何不影响其推理能力。

Method: 使用两个可控合成推理数据集（FDA和THR），分析模型记忆标签噪声的机制。

Result: 模型通过分布式编码和异常启发式记忆噪声标签，但仍保留推理能力。

Conclusion: 记忆标签噪声依赖于而非覆盖推理机制，揭示了良性记忆现象。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to
produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and
contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and
entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has
received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is
currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area.
To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun
generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional
approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models.
Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to
assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research
challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 解决TOD系统在低资源场景下因标注数据不足而性能受限的问题。

Method: 提出Spec-TOD框架，结合任务指令的LLMs和轻量级训练策略，减少监督需求。

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上表现优异，显著降低标注数据需求。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD为低资源TOD系统提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Relation extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, with
broad applications in knowledge graph construction and literary analysis.
However, the complex context and implicit expressions in novel texts pose
significant challenges for automatic character relationship extraction. This
study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

along with $\textit{NyayChat}$, a dataset of 300 annotated chatbot
conversations. We also introduce $\textit{Judgments}$ data sourced from Indian
Consumer Courts to aid the chatbot in decision making and to enhance user
trust. We also propose $\textbf{HAB}$ metrics ($\textbf{Helpfulness, Accuracy,
Brevity}$) to evaluate chatbot performance. Legal domain experts validated
Grahak-Nyay's effectiveness. Code and datasets will be released.

Result: 生成的合成对话可用于训练问题重写器，结合现有检索器和LLM生成系统响应。

Conclusion: 提出的流程能够有效生成OR-CONVQA训练数据，支持实际应用中的对话问答系统开发。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）中语义表示的位置，以促进可解释性和架构创新。

Method: 构建Transformer模型，嵌入层完全冻结，使用基于Unicode字形视觉结构的非语义预计算嵌入。

Result: 模型在MMLU推理基准上优于传统可训练嵌入模型，表明语义是架构的涌现属性。

Conclusion: 输入嵌入层的作用应从语义容器重新定义为结构基元。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个可靠自动化评估人类感知质量的框架，显示通用模型常优于领域专用模型，并开源了基准和工具以推动用户中心生成模型的发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Conclusion: Co-DETECT通过混合主动标注显著提升边缘案例处理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt

provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and
quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法在准确捕捉全文相似性方面优于现有技术，并能有效区分逻辑蕴含、不一致性和无关性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模文本数据的透明和可靠信息检索提供了新方向。

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Motivation: 传统方法估计题目难度成本高且无法用于冷启动问题，需改进。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）对齐模拟学生能力，生成响应并通过LLM评分模型评估，拟合IRT模型预测难度。

Result: 实验表明SMART在真实数据集上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SMART为冷启动问题提供高效、准确的题目难度预测方案。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Motivation: 日语学习者因文字差异（如汉字复杂性）面临记忆挑战，现有LLM方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出生成框架，显式建模助记规则，使用EM算法学习潜在结构和组合规则。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在新学习者冷启动场景表现良好，并揭示了有效助记词生成的机制。

Conclusion: 该方法为日语词汇学习提供了可解释且系统化的助记词生成方案。

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的能力及其滥用问题，提出了区分人类与机器生成文本（Task-A）及识别生成模型（Task-B）的方法，并展示了GPT_4o-mini和BERT模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs生成的高质量文本被滥用于网络犯罪和虚假信息传播，亟需有效方法检测机器生成内容及其来源。

Method: 通过微调GPT_4o-mini、LLaMA 3 8B和BERT模型，分别执行Task-A（区分人类与机器文本）和Task-B（识别生成模型）。

Result: 微调后的GPT_4o-mini和BERT在Task-A中准确率达0.9547，Task-B中为0.4698。

Conclusion: 研究验证了微调模型在检测机器生成文本及其来源上的有效性，但Task-B仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练后方法（如监督微调）未能充分利用预训练获得的知识，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 将FFN层视为关联键值记忆，通过前向干预或反向传播正则化促进记忆向量的使用。

Result: 在15个下游任务中表现一致提升，模型能自适应分配信息，生成更有意义的标记。

Conclusion: 训练后阶段未充分利用预训练潜力，通过潜在表示空间干预可提升性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

Result: OpenS2S成功构建了一个可扩展的训练语料库，并开源了模型、数据集和代码。

Conclusion: OpenS2S为情感化语音系统的研究提供了透明、开放的工具，有望加速该领域的创新。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等低资源语言生成可靠的新闻解释至关重要，但目前缺乏自动化工具。

Method: 通过整合DPO和课程学习，利用可信来源的事实核查解释作为首选响应，LLM输出作为非首选响应，并引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化DPO损失函数。

Result: 实验证明该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（如Mistral、Llama、mBART等）。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展至低资源语言，有效应对错误信息并提升自动化解释生成能力。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

TL;DR: POLAR是一种新颖的奖励建模方法，通过将奖励建模视为策略判别器，捕捉策略间的相对差异，显著提升了奖励模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，POLAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出POLAR预训练方法，训练奖励模型以区分相同和不同策略，捕捉策略与目标策略的相对差异。

Result: POLAR显著提升奖励模型性能，例如在STEM任务中准确率从54.8%提升至81.0%，并展示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR在性能、泛化和扩展性方面表现出色，是开发通用强大奖励模型的有前途方向。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文启动中的潜在漏洞，揭示对话历史如何诱导模型生成违规内容。

Method: 提出“响应攻击”（Response Attack），利用辅助LLM生成轻微有害的对话内容，并通过触发提示诱导目标模型生成有害内容。

Result: 在八个开源和专有LLM中，响应攻击的攻破成功率显著高于七种现有技术。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LLMs的上下文启动漏洞，并提出了一种有效的防御方法，即上下文感知的安全微调数据集。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注推理、规划和执行能力，而忽视了记忆机制（如记忆、更新和检索长期信息）的评估，且缺乏全面覆盖四种核心能力的测试集。

Method: 结合重新设计的现有数据集和新构建的数据集，创建MemoryAgentBench，覆盖四种记忆能力，并评估了多种记忆代理的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前方法在四种能力上均表现不足，突显了进一步研究全面记忆机制的必要性。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench为评估和改进记忆代理提供了系统且具有挑战性的测试平台，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，离线技术依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据收集和手动标注，而在线方法性能有限，尤其是在复杂路口。MRC-VMap旨在填补这一空白，提供低成本高性能的解决方案。

Method: MRC-VMap利用多方向摄像头图像，直接转换为矢量地图表示，省去了中间模块（如特征提取和BEV转换），降低了计算开销和错误传播。

Result: 在4000个中国主要城市路口的实验中，MRC-VMap不仅优于现有在线方法，还达到了与高成本LiDAR方法相当的精度。

Conclusion: MRC-VMap为现代自动驾驶导航系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe
operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these
maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive,
labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online
approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited
performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network
designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.
Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts
time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.
This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate
modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)
conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error
propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping
completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under
practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000
intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that
MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves
accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a
scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically
complex sport. Our approach introduces a standardised annotation methodology
encompassing player positioning, shot types, court formations, and match
outcomes, coupled with a specialised annotation tool designed to meet the
unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose
estimation. This combination significantly reduces manual annotation effort
whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex
visual and contextual features essential for doubles tennis analysis. Our
integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical
analysis, performance evaluation, and strategic modelling in professional
tennis.

Motivation: 食品不安全是全球城市面临的重大社会与公共卫生问题，现有依赖调查数据的方法难以扩展。

Method: 提出两步方法：特征提取和门控注意力图像聚合，并与其他模型架构对比评估。

Result: 模型预测能力略低，但学习权重解释和案例研究表明其潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为城市规划和政策制定中食品不安全识别的补充工具。

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

Conclusion: OBSER框架为零样本环境识别提供了可靠方法，推动了自主环境理解的发展。

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment
understanding.

TL;DR: GameTileNet是一个低分辨率游戏图块的语义数据集，旨在通过视觉-语言对齐支持叙事驱动的程序化内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏视觉资产与叙事不一致的问题，以及训练数据风格分布不均导致的生成内容多样性不足。

Method: 收集OpenGameArt.org上艺术家创作的图块，提供语义标注，并建立低分辨率图块中对象检测的流程。

Result: 数据集支持叙事驱动的游戏内容生成，并为低分辨率非真实感图像中的对象检测提供基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet是改进程序化内容生成方法和支持丰富叙事游戏内容的宝贵资源。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低而表现不佳，TS旨在通过动态调整时间关注点解决这一问题。

Result: TS通过动态调整时间关注点，显著提升了MLLMs对长视频的理解能力。

Conclusion: TS为长视频理解提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 在传染病大流行期间（如埃博拉和SARS），快速、非侵入性的体温监测方法对公共场所（如医院和机场）至关重要。

Method: 采用粗-精配准策略，结合基于标志点和眼轮廓边缘检测的配准模型，实现红外和白光图像的多模态配准。

Result: 配准精度在2.7毫米以内，能够精确定位眼角区域。

Conclusion: 该方法为发热筛查提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Fever screening based on infrared thermographs (IRTs) is a viable mass
screening approach during infectious disease pandemics, such as Ebola and SARS,
for temperature monitoring in public places like hospitals and airports. IRTs
have found to be powerful, quick and non-invasive methods to detect elevated
temperatures. Moreover, regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi (called
the canthi regions in this paper) are preferred sites for fever screening.
Accurate localization of the canthi regions can be achieved through multi-modal
registration of infrared (IR) and white-light images. We proposed a
registration method through a coarse-fine registration strategy using different
registration models based on landmarks and edge detection on eye contours. We
evaluated the registration accuracy to be within 2.7 mm, which enables accurate
localization of the canthi regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSAT的新型注意力机制，通过压缩感知技术降低计算复杂度，适用于视觉语言模型（vLLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制在vLLMs中因跨模态计算导致高内存和延迟成本，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: CSAT利用随机测量矩阵将高维键值表示投影到低维子空间，并通过稀疏恢复算法重建注意力输出。

Result: CSAT显著降低了注意力复杂度，同时保持了语义保真度，在标准基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: CSAT为下一代多模态Transformer提供了一种可扩展、高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image
captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these
models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the
quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental
computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where
attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,
leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the
Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that
reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By
projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a
lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing
the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly
reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to
vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual
representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,
and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to
LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit
from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them
particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal
mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision
language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,
highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient
solution for next generation multimodal transformers.

Motivation: 传统检测算法对目标图像的角度、方向和清晰度要求严格，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 采用多样化场景增强（DSE）方法扩展数据集，并提出关键对象聚焦（KOF）机制增强小目标特征的细粒度学习。

Result: 改进后的算法在原始测试图像上mAP达到98.9%，在视角偏移测试图像上mAP为94.7%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VR-YOLO在保持计算成本几乎不变的情况下，显著提升了PCB缺陷检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of large-scale circuits and systems emphasizes the importance
of automated defect detection of electronic components. The YOLO image
detection model has been used to detect PCB defects and it has become a typical
AI-assisted case of traditional industrial production. However, conventional
detection algorithms have stringent requirements for the angle, orientation,
and clarity of target images. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PCB defect
detection algorithm, named VR-YOLO, based on the YOLOv8 model. This algorithm
aims to improve the model's generalization performance and enhance viewpoint
robustness in practical application scenarios. We first propose a diversified
scene enhancement (DSE) method by expanding the PCB defect dataset by
incorporating diverse scenarios and segmenting samples to improve target
diversity. A novel key object focus (KOF) scheme is then presented by
considering angular loss and introducing an additional attention mechanism to
enhance fine-grained learning of small target features. Experimental results
demonstrate that our improved PCB defect detection approach achieves a mean
average precision (mAP) of 98.9% for the original test images, and 94.7% for
the test images with viewpoint shifts (horizontal and vertical shear
coefficients of $\pm 0.06$ and rotation angle of $\pm 10$ degrees), showing
significant improvements compared to the baseline YOLO model with negligible
additional computational cost.

Motivation: 传统对抗攻击局限于单图像扰动，缺乏多样性和概念保持能力。本文旨在扩展攻击框架，以概念为基础生成更有效的对抗样本。

Method: 采用概率生成模型或图像集表示概念，从中采样生成多样化的对抗样本，保持原始概念但改变姿态、视角或背景。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明，该方法能生成更多样化的对抗样本，有效保持概念，同时提高攻击效率。

Conclusion: 基于概念的对抗攻击框架在多样性和效率上优于传统方法，为对抗攻击研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and

Conclusion: 该框架为印度农业监测和管理提供了可操作的数据驱动解决方案，展示了其在全国范围内的潜力和实用性。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

Conclusion: AI可作为圣经文本重新解读的创意伙伴，但其在神圣艺术中的角色仍复杂且有争议。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the
visualization of Biblical narratives by analyzing AI-generated images of Exodus
2:5-9 (Moses found in River Nile) using MidJourney. Drawing on the classical
concepts of mimesis (imitation) and poiesis (creative generation), the authors
investigate how text-to-image (T2I) models reproduce or reimagine sacred
narratives. Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results
and classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and
cultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI
excels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also
reflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights
AI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for
genuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth. It concludes by
suggesting that AI can serve as a creative partner in reinterpreting biblical
texts, though its role in sacred art remains complex and contested.

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在空间变形推理方面仍有显著局限性。

Abstract: Humans naturally possess the spatial reasoning ability to form and manipulate
images and structures of objects in space. There is an increasing effort to
endow Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with similar spatial reasoning
capabilities. However, it remains unclear whether these models truly understand
and manipulate spatial objects or not. To address this question, we propose a
new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the performance of VLMs in spatial
deformation reasoning tasks. Specifically, we construct a benchmark for spatial
deformation reasoning from 2D to 3D. Leveraging our data engine, we can
generate unlimited evaluation problem pairs with infinite steps, without any
data leakage. We explore whether the model can effectively perform spatial
deformation reasoning from two directions: forward reasoning (given the
operations, find the final state) and reverse reasoning (given the final state,
determine the operations). We adopt a ladder competition format, using the
number of deformation steps as the level classification criterion, with the
goal of exploring the boundaries of the model's deformation reasoning
capabilities. Interestingly, the benchmarking results reveal that almost no
model demonstrates plausible spatial deformation reasoning abilities.
Furthermore, even after applying targeted training and mainstream reasoning
enhancement methods, the models are still unable to perform well on 3D spatial
deformation reasoning.

Result: 在基准医学图像分类数据集上评估，IMET表现出提升模型鲁棒性和准确性的潜力。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种有效的数据高效训练策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

### [165] [Gated Recursive Fusion: A Stateful Approach to Scalable Multimodal Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02985)
*Yusuf Shihata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRF是一种线性可扩展的循环架构，通过门控循环融合（GRF）解决多模态学习中深度融合与计算可扩展性之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在深度融合与计算可扩展性之间存在矛盾，现有交叉注意力模型虽性能强但计算复杂度高。

Method: GRF采用循环管道处理多模态数据，通过Transformer解码器层进行对称交叉注意力，并利用门控融合单元动态控制信息流。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI基准测试中，GRF性能与更复杂的基线模型相当，且嵌入空间可视化显示其生成结构化、类别可分的表示。

Conclusion: GRF为高效、强大的多模态表示学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI系统需要数据高效且领域感知的预训练策略，但临床数据集（如MIMIC-CXR）数据量有限且标注稀缺。

Method: 将成对胸部X光片（正侧位）视为自然正样本对，通过稀疏补丁重建视图并对齐潜在嵌入。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR上表现优于监督目标和未利用结构的基线方法。

Conclusion: 为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了轻量级、模态无关的方案。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Abstract: This work introduces VISY-REVE: a novel pipeline to validate image processing

with synthesized views at novel poses. This approach creates continuous
trajectories from sparse, pre-existing datasets in open or closed-loop. In
addition, we introduce a new distance metric between camera poses, the
Boresight Deviation Distance, which is better suited for view synthesis than
existing metrics. Using it, a method for increasing the density of image

Conclusion: FreqCross通过频域分析揭示了合成图像的独特频谱特征，为检测AI生成图像提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion 3.5,
has enabled the generation of highly photorealistic synthetic images that pose
significant challenges to existing detection methods. This paper presents
FreqCross, a novel multi-modal fusion network that combines spatial RGB
features, frequency domain artifacts, and radial energy distribution patterns
to achieve robust detection of AI-generated images. Our approach leverages a
three-branch architecture: (1) a ResNet-18 backbone for spatial feature
extraction, (2) a lightweight CNN for processing 2D FFT magnitude spectra, and
(3) a multi-layer perceptron for analyzing radial energy profiles. We introduce
a novel radial energy distribution analysis that captures characteristic
frequency artifacts inherent in diffusion-generated images, and fuse it with
spatial and spectral cues via simple feature concatenation followed by a
compact classification head. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 10,000
paired real (MS-COCO) and synthetic (Stable Diffusion 3.5) images demonstrate
that FreqCross achieves 97.8\% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines by 5.2\%. The frequency analysis further reveals that synthetic
images exhibit distinct spectral signatures in the 0.1--0.4 normalised
frequency range, providing theoretical foundation for our approach. Code and
pre-trained models are publicly available to facilitate reproducible research.

Motivation: 早期脊柱侧弯难以检测，传统X射线方法存在辐射风险且依赖专家经验，限制了大规模筛查的应用。

Method: 采用动态时间规整（DTW）聚类分割步态视频关键阶段，引入跨袋时间注意力（IBTA）机制聚焦诊断特征，设计边界感知模型（BAM）提升对细微偏差的敏感性，结合文本指导增强特征表示。

Result: 在Scoliosis1K数据集上表现优异，尤其在处理类别不平衡和检测边界案例方面。

Conclusion: TG-MILNet为脊柱侧弯早期筛查提供了高效、非侵入性的解决方案，具有临床推广潜力。

Abstract: Early-stage scoliosis is often difficult to detect, particularly in
adolescents, where delayed diagnosis can lead to serious health issues.
Traditional X-ray-based methods carry radiation risks and rely heavily on
clinical expertise, limiting their use in large-scale screenings. To overcome
these challenges, we propose a Text-Guided Multi-Instance Learning Network
(TG-MILNet) for non-invasive scoliosis detection using gait videos. To handle
temporal misalignment in gait sequences, we employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
clustering to segment videos into key gait phases. To focus on the most
relevant diagnostic features, we introduce an Inter-Bag Temporal Attention
(IBTA) mechanism that highlights critical gait phases. Recognizing the
difficulty in identifying borderline cases, we design a Boundary-Aware Model
(BAM) to improve sensitivity to subtle spinal deviations. Additionally, we
incorporate textual guidance from domain experts and large language models
(LLM) to enhance feature representation and improve model interpretability.
Experiments on the large-scale Scoliosis1K gait dataset show that TG-MILNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in handling class
imbalance and accurately detecting challenging borderline cases. The code is

Motivation: 探索梯度基（HOG）和拓扑基（TDA）特征提取方法在医学图像分类中的效果，填补视网膜图像领域的空白。

Method: 使用HOG和TDA分别提取特征，训练七种经典机器学习模型，并通过10折交叉验证评估性能。

Result: XGBoost在二分类和多分类任务中表现最佳，HOG和TDA准确率相近（二分类约94%，多分类约74%）。

Conclusion: HOG和TDA在视网膜图像分类中性能竞争，但提取特征不同，适用于其他医学图像领域并可集成到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Abstract: Performance measures such as stride length in athletics and the pace of
runners can be estimated using different tricks such as measuring the number of
steps divided by the running length or helping with markers printed on the
track. Monitoring individual performance is essential for supporting staff
coaches in establishing a proper training schedule for each athlete. The aim of
this paper is to investigate a computer vision-based approach for estimating
stride length and speed transition from video sequences and assessing video
analysis processing among athletes. Using some well-known image processing
methodologies such as probabilistic hough transform combined with a human pose
detection algorithm, we estimate the leg joint position of runners. In this
way, applying a homography transformation, we can estimate the runner stride
length. Experiments on various race videos with three different runners
demonstrated that the proposed system represents a useful tool for coaching and
training. This suggests its potential value in measuring and monitoring the
gait parameters of athletes.

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在推理后期过度依赖文本信息而忽视视觉输入的问题。

Method: 通过分析MLLM注意力模式，提出Look-Back方法，引导模型自发重新关注视觉输入。

Result: Look-Back显著提升了模型在多模态基准测试中的推理和感知能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备自发视觉融合推理能力，Look-Back方法有效且无需显式约束。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

the scientific background, clinical translation, and future applications of
intelligent histology in tumor neurosurgery. We focus on the major scientific

intelligent histology across multiple neurosurgical specialties, including
neurosurgical oncology, skull base, spine oncology, pediatric tumors, and
periperal nerve tumors. Future directions include the development of AI
foundation models through multi-institutional datasets, incorporating clinical

Conclusion: LATTE展示了潜在轨迹嵌入在生成图像检测中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Motivation: 现有研究通常将幻觉归因于技术限制或迎合性偏见，但忽视了其可能反映人类心理学中的认知偏差。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了AIpsych基准测试，分析模型架构和参数规模对行为的影响，并通过人类实验验证假设。

Result: 实验表明，随着模型规模增大，VLMs表现出更强的迎合性但减少的权威偏见，暗示能力提升但可能损害回答的完整性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLMs幻觉提供了新视角，强调了将心理学原则融入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，EBM具有可解释性优势，但尚未广泛应用于大气科学。本文旨在开发可解释的、基于物理的机器学习算法，并应用于OT检测。

Method: 通过数学方法提取关键特征（如云纹理），应用EBM进行分类任务，利用卫星图像数据（可见光和红外）进行训练。

Result: 最终模型虽然精度不及复杂方法，但表现良好，是可解释ML算法的重要进展。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程为气象学应用提供了可解释的机器学习解决方案，推动了人机协作的发展。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Abstract: Like many countries, Nigeria is naturally endowed with fertile agricultural
soil that supports large-scale tomato production. However, the prevalence of
disease causing pathogens poses a significant threat to tomato health, often
leading to reduced yields and, in severe cases, the extinction of certain
species. These diseases jeopardise both the quality and quantity of tomato
harvests, contributing to food insecurity. Fortunately, tomato diseases can
often be visually identified through distinct forms, appearances, or textures,
typically first visible on leaves and fruits. This study presents an enhanced
Capsule-YOLO network architecture designed to automatically segment overlapping
and occluded tomato leaf images from complex backgrounds using the YOLO
framework. It identifies disease symptoms with impressive performance metrics:
99.31% accuracy, 98.78% recall, and 99.09% precision, and a 98.93% F1-score
representing improvements of 2.91%, 1.84%, 5.64%, and 4.12% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was developed
to allow farmers and users to upload images of affected tomato plants and
detect early disease symptoms. The system also provides recommendations for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The effectiveness of this approach
promises significant benefits for the agricultural sector by enhancing crop
yields and strengthening food security.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在正交投影下通过跟踪图像中一个特征点来解析计算刚体旋转的方法，适用于任意形状的3D物体，无需场景先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在正交投影和相机固定的条件下，如何通过简单特征点跟踪解析计算刚体的旋转，以简化计算并提高实用性。

Method: 基于正交投影和固定相机视角，通过跟踪刚体上的一个特征点，解析推导旋转速率，适用于任意形状的刚体。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能准确计算旋转速率，并通过视频数据验证了其有效性，同时能区分不同刚体的点。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单、通用的刚体旋转计算方案，适用于并行处理和场景分割。

Abstract: We demonstrate that, under orthographic projection and with a camera fixated
on a point located on a rigid body, the rotation of that body can be
analytically obtained by tracking only one other feature in the image. With
some exceptions, any tracked point, regardless of its location on the body,
yields the same value of the instantaneous rotation rate.
  The proposed method is independent of the shape of the 3D object and does not
require a priori knowledge about the scene. This algorithm is suited for
parallel processing and can achieve segmentation of the scene by distinguishing
points that do not belong to the same rigid body, simply because they do not
produce the same value of the rotation. This paper presents an analytical
derivation, simulation results, and results from real video data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SICL的损失函数，通过重新加权来自同一主题的负样本对，抑制主题特异性信息，提升人类活动识别的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法（如对比学习）在人类活动识别（HAR）中具有吸引力。然而，HAR传感器信号因主题变异性导致显著的领域偏移，影响模型对新主题的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一主题的负样本对，减少主题特异性信息，突出活动特异性特征。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试（UTD-MHAD、MMAct和DARai）上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL是一种简单有效的损失函数，能够提升HAR模型的泛化能力，并适用于多种自监督方法、多模态场景和监督学习框架。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了场景合成的3D一致性和语义丰富性，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object
scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result,
these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional
geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel
conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged
into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to
endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior
knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D
geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene,
i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically
rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires
a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable
generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent
image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing
individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image
creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to
previous approaches.

Method: 通过全面的消融实验，提出Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR)和Information Gap (IG)指标，量化编码器的独特贡献和整体效用差异。

Result: 实验表明部分视觉编码器贡献极小甚至负面，证实了冗余现象的普遍存在。

Conclusion: 当前多编码器设计存在低效问题，提出的指标可作为诊断工具，优化多模态架构设计。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Motivation: 双频PolSAR图像的协同分类面临区域一致性对分类信息学习的影响以及双频数据合理利用的挑战。

Method: 设计了统计动态样本校正模块（SDSR）和双频门控选择蒸馏模块（DGSD），分别用于优化样本纯度和实现双频数据的互补学习。

Result: 在四个实测双频PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，SKDNet-SSR优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: SKDNet-SSR通过样本校正和双频数据互补学习，有效提升了双频PolSAR图像的分类性能。

Abstract: The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a
meaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on
classification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data
are two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To
tackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with
statistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this
article. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature
extractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is
designed to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial
information learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR
covariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first
dynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and
pixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature
interaction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the
classification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected
distillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of
different frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency
data. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher
model to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to
learn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of
dual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on
four measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed
SKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）基准测试因使用固定提示词，可能低估模型真实生成能力，并导致模型间不公平比较。

Method: 基于ConceptMix，引入多模态优化流程，利用视觉语言模型反馈系统优化提示词。

Result: 优化提示词显著提升生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，并发现某些视觉概念（如空间关系和形状）优化效果更显著。

Conclusion: 固定基准测试可能低估模型真实能力，而ConceptMix++提供更准确的评估方法，并为未来开发提供洞察。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法依赖微调，成本高且可能导致性能下降，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 在训练过程中随机划分小批量数据为遗忘集和保留集，优化模型使其无法预测遗忘集，通过撤销密钥实现即时遗忘。

Result: 实验表明{\pname}在多种数据集和架构上优于现有方法，避免了性能下降。

Conclusion: {\pname}提供了一种高效、无需微调的机器遗忘解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MUL) refers to the problem of making a pre-trained model
selectively forget some training instances or class(es) while retaining
performance on the remaining dataset. Existing MUL research involves
fine-tuning using a forget and/or retain set, making it expensive and/or
impractical, and often causing performance degradation in the unlearned model.
We introduce {\pname}, an unlearning-aware vision transformer-based
architecture that can directly perform unlearning for future unlearning
requests without any fine-tuning over the requested set. The proposed model is
trained by simulating unlearning during the training process itself. It
involves randomly separating class(es)/sub-class(es) present in each mini-batch
into two disjoint sets: a proxy forget-set and a retain-set, and the model is
optimized so that it is unable to predict the forget-set. Forgetting is
achieved by withdrawing keys, making unlearning on-the-fly and avoiding
performance degradation. The model is trained jointly with learnable keys and
original weights, ensuring withholding a key irreversibly erases information,
validated by membership inference attack scores. Extensive experiments on
various datasets, architectures, and resolutions confirm {\pname}'s superiority
over both fine-tuning-free and fine-tuning-based methods.

Conclusion: MolVision通过多模态融合和高效微调策略，为分子属性预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in computational
chemistry with critical applications in drug discovery and materials science.
While recent works have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task,
they primarily rely on textual molecular representations such as
SMILES/SELFIES, which can be ambiguous and structurally less informative. In
this work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images
and textual descriptions to enhance property prediction. We construct a
benchmark spanning ten diverse datasets, covering classification, regression
and description tasks. Evaluating nine different VLMs in zero-shot, few-shot,
and fine-tuned settings, we find that visual information improves prediction
performance, particularly when combined with efficient fine-tuning strategies
such as LoRA. Our results reveal that while visual information alone is
insufficient, multimodal fusion significantly enhances generalization across
molecular properties. Adaptation of vision encoder for molecular images in
conjunction with LoRA further improves the performance. The code and data is

Result: 在ScanNet25k数据集上，平均对齐精度提升4.3%，在SUN2CAD测试集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督条件下优于现有方法，且能泛化到新类别。

Abstract: One practical approach to infer 3D scene structure from a single image is to
retrieve a closely matching 3D model from a database and align it with the
object in the image. Existing methods rely on supervised training with images
and pose annotations, which limits them to a narrow set of object categories.
To address this, we propose a weakly supervised 9-DoF alignment method for
inexact 3D models that requires no pose annotations and generalizes to unseen
categories. Our approach derives a novel feature space based on foundation
features that ensure multi-view consistency and overcome symmetry ambiguities
inherent in foundation features using a self-supervised triplet loss.
Additionally, we introduce a texture-invariant pose refinement technique that
performs dense alignment in normalized object coordinates, estimated through
the enhanced feature space. We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world
ScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised
baselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised
approach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we
introduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where
our method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal malignancies constitute a leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, with advanced-stage prognosis remaining particularly
dismal. Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer
treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile
intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted
systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their
clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase
recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art
approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that
iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical
Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that
reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while
preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture
progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and
conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three
domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary
ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.
Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to
improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations
on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed
CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative
paradigms for surgical phase recognition.

Conclusion: SemiOVS能有效利用未标记OOD图像，为半监督语义分割任务提供新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes
abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this
work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了多模态领域泛化的性能，解决了模态间不一致和泛化方向分歧的挑战。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or
distributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source
domains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning
strategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they
predominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous
multi-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key
challenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling
models trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target
distributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences
between modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG
typically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness
during generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to
consider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each
modality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent
generalization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded
generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
approach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired
modalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling
synchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,
we introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates
modal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment
of unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness
and superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.

Abstract: Multi-camera systems are increasingly vital in the environmental perception
of autonomous vehicles and robotics. Their physical configuration offers
inherent fixed relative pose constraints that benefit Structure-from-Motion
(SfM). However, traditional global SfM systems struggle with robustness due to
their optimization framework. We propose a novel global motion averaging
framework for multi-camera systems, featuring two core components: a decoupled
rotation averaging module and a hybrid translation averaging module. Our
rotation averaging employs a hierarchical strategy by first estimating relative
rotations within rigid camera units and then computing global rigid unit
rotations. To enhance the robustness of translation averaging, we incorporate
both camera-to-camera and camera-to-point constraints to initialize camera
positions and 3D points with a convex distance-based objective function and
refine them with an unbiased non-bilinear angle-based objective function.
Experiments on large-scale datasets show that our system matches or exceeds
incremental SfM accuracy while significantly improving efficiency. Our
framework outperforms existing global SfM methods, establishing itself as a
robust solution for real-world multi-camera SfM applications. The code is
available at https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM/.

compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决源自由无监督域适应（SFUDA）中低质量原型样本和伪标签错误分配问题的方法，通过可靠样本记忆模块、多视图对比学习和噪声标签过滤技术，显著提升了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中隐私问题限制了敏感数据的访问，SFUDA成为解决方案，但原型样本质量低和伪标签错误分配仍是挑战。

Method: 分三个阶段：可靠样本记忆模块（RSM）提升原型质量；多视图对比学习（MVCL）增强伪标签质量；噪声标签过滤进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种先进方法平均提升约2%和6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键问题，显著提升了域适应的性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Motivation: 现有生成模型（如GPT-4o）在视觉保真度上表现良好，但商业设计任务需要更复杂的结构化布局和品牌一致性。

Method: MIMO结合了分层多模态代理系统（MIMO-Core）和协调循环（MIMO-Loop），通过自然语言提示和标志图像输入，自动检测并纠正生成中的错误。

Conclusion: MIMO为商业设计任务提供了一种高效且高质量的自动生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent generative models such as GPT-4o have shown strong capabilities in
producing high-quality images with accurate text rendering. However, commercial
design tasks like advertising banners demand more than visual fidelity -- they
require structured layouts, precise typography, consistent branding, and more.
In this paper, we introduce MIMO (Mirror In-the-Model), an agentic refinement
framework for automatic ad banner generation. MIMO combines a hierarchical
multi-modal agent system (MIMO-Core) with a coordination loop (MIMO-Loop) that
explores multiple stylistic directions and iteratively improves design quality.
Requiring only a simple natural language based prompt and logo image as input,
MIMO automatically detects and corrects multiple types of errors during
generation. Experiments show that MIMO significantly outperforms existing
diffusion and LLM-based baselines in real-world banner design scenarios.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSLR方法难以处理多样样本，且动态卷积主要关注空间建模，忽略了时间动态和上下文依赖。

Method: 提出DESign框架，结合DCAC动态捕捉帧间运动线索和上下文信息，以及SR-CTC通过子网监督防止CTC过拟合。

Result: 在PHOENIX14、PHOENIX14-T和CSL-Daily数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DESign通过DCAC和SR-CTC有效提升CSLR的泛化能力和准确性，且SR-CTC可无缝集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验表明，经过精心设计的简单模型在六个挑战性数据集上可匹配或超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 优化核心组件与架构创新同样重要，论文提出的指南和架构为未来方法提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Conclusion: MRC-DETR为PCB缺陷检测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，新数据集为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: In modern electronic manufacturing, defect detection on Printed Circuit
Boards (PCBs) plays a critical role in ensuring product yield and maintaining
the reliability of downstream assembly processes. However, existing methods
often suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and
insufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that
hinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and
efficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built
upon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation
capability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This
module improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual
structure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture
fine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational
power of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy
caused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive
Screening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and
aggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level
semantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant
computations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection
accuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,
particularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality
dataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources. Our dataset not
only supports the training and evaluation of our proposed framework but also
serves as a valuable benchmark for future research in this domain.

Conclusion: MTID通过增强视觉监督和优化动作生成空间，显著提升了动作序列的预测能力，为程序规划任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of procedure planning in
instructional videos, aiming to generate coherent and task-aligned action
sequences from start and end visual observations. Previous work has mainly
relied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and
unobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal
relationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked
Temporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space
temporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages
a learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,
thereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By
integrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end
training tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the
model's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,
we introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action
generation space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to
prioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end
states over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out
task-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action
sequences. Experimental results across three widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MTID achieves promising action planning performance on
most metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/WiserZhou/MTID.

Abstract: Estimating normals for noisy point clouds is a persistent challenge in 3D
geometry processing, particularly for end-to-end oriented normal estimation.
Existing methods generally address relatively clean data and rely on supervised
priors to fit local surfaces within specific neighborhoods. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through
local gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto
the underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an
implicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a
distance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which
integrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an
implicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding
projection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of
over-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient
consistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.
Comprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and
point cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
method. The source code and trained models are available at

Conclusion: 该工作填补了可控基准和开放世界需求之间的空白，开创了基于解剖感知的时尚图像编辑新方向。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

Method: 提出REAL方法，包括两阶段修正：1）通过反向最大化预测熵消除对抗性；2）通过正向最小化预测熵确保正确分类。此外，提出攻击感知权重机制。

Result: 实验表明，REAL显著提升了现有样本修正模型的性能。

Conclusion: LE先验和REAL方法为对抗样本防御提供了通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing defense methods fail to defend against unknown attacks and thus
raise generalization issue of adversarial robustness. To remedy this problem,
we attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various
attacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low
entropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on
the universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is
elaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.
2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower
entropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark
contrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct
existing test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:
Rectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial
rectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with
clean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified
with low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating
their adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly
classified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward
minimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization
scheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware
weighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy
objectives. Experiments on several datasets show that REAL can greatly improve
the performance of existing sample rectification models.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）数据规模的扩大，噪声对应关系（NC）样本的引入降低了模型性能，而传统方法需要从头训练，资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NCU框架，通过学习最难的负样本信息，统一优化目标以快速微调，消除NC的有害影响。

Result: 在CLIP模型上的实验表明，NCU在零样本迁移任务中表现优于传统方法，且计算开销更低。

Conclusion: NCU为提升预训练VLMs的鲁棒性提供了一种高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled
up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable
trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC)
samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs
the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by
estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such
resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet
realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that
seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs.
Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning
framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned
noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information,
which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and
false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one
unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our
approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks.
Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer
while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Robots and autonomous vehicles should be aware of what happens in their
surroundings. The segmentation and tracking of moving objects are essential for
reliable path planning, including collision avoidance. We investigate this
estimation task for vehicles using radar sensing. We address moving instance
tracking in sparse radar point clouds to enhance scene interpretation. We
propose a learning-based radar tracker incorporating temporal offset
predictions to enable direct center-based association and enhance segmentation
performance by including additional motion cues. We implement attention-based
tracking for sparse radar scans to include appearance features and enhance
performance. The final association combines geometric and appearance features
to overcome the limitations of center-based tracking to associate instances
reliably. Our approach shows an improved performance on the moving instance
tracking benchmark of the RadarScenes dataset compared to the current state of
the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示工程依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽视了细粒度局部语义，而现有方法假设VLMs能识别局部细节，但实验表明CLIP对全局模式有强烈偏好，限制了其处理局部描述符的能力。

Method: 采用随机多裁剪增强技术，通过裁剪部分区域约束模型的感受野并重新校准其注意力机制，从而减轻其固有偏好。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下，D&D方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、有效且即插即用，显著提升了CLIP在局部特征分析上的能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的单次雷达扫描移动物体分割方法，利用雷达的多普勒速度信息，显著提升了分割精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要实时感知周围移动物体，传统方法依赖时间序列数据，而雷达直接提供瞬时速度信息，但现有方法未能充分利用这一优势。

Method: 开发了Radar Velocity Transformer，通过在每个网络模块中整合速度信息，并提出了基于Transformer的上采样方法，克服稀疏点云的限制。

Result: 网络运行速度快于传感器帧率，仅需单次雷达扫描即可实现优于现有方法的分割效果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了雷达数据中移动物体的分割精度，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: The awareness about moving objects in the surroundings of a self-driving
vehicle is essential for safe and reliable autonomous navigation. The
interpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but
typically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in
order to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are
already installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they
directly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate
instantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,
we tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point
clouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance
scene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify
moving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform
single-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The
key to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity
information throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise
segmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a
transformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively
combining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse
point clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation
benchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other
state-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the
sensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar
data.

*Kaijie Yin,Zhiyuan Zhang,Shu Kong,Tian Gao,Chengzhong Xu,Hui Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiCD是一种专为变化检测设计的二进制神经网络（BNN），通过增强表示能力和特征可分性，解决了传统二值化方法在变化检测中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络二值化方法直接量化权重和激活值，限制了变化检测模型的性能，导致检测精度显著下降。

Method: BiCD引入基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则的辅助目标，设计紧凑的可学习辅助模块，优化重构损失和变化检测损失。

Result: 在街景和遥感数据集上的实验表明，BiCD在BNN变化检测领域取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BiCD为基于BNN的变化检测设定了新的基准，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Binarized Change Detection (BiCD), the first binary
neural network (BNN) designed specifically for change detection. Conventional
network binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and
activations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to
represent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.
This results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued
networks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational
power and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.
Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information
Bottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input
information while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly
computing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a
compact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a
simple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction
loss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view
and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark
for BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this
domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，融合视频、图像和文本表示，通过GRU序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制提升细粒度视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视频分类需要理解复杂的时空和语义信息，单一模态难以胜任。

Method: 使用GRU序列编码器和跨模态注意力机制融合多模态表示，结合分类或回归损失训练，并通过特征增强和自编码技术正则化。

Result: 在DVD和Aff-Wild2数据集上显著优于单模态基线，跨注意力和特征增强对鲁棒性和性能贡献显著。

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略有效提升了细粒度视频分类性能，跨注意力和特征增强是关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在细胞表型分析中缺乏统一的性能评估，PhenoBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 提供PhenoCell数据集和评估代码，系统测试多种病理学基础模型在不同泛化场景下的表现。

Result: 现有模型在PhenoCell上的表现（F1分数低至0.20）远低于其他基准测试（如Lizard和PanNuke），表明任务更具挑战性。

Conclusion: PhenoCell为未来基础模型和监督模型的性能评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Digital pathology has seen the advent of a wealth of foundational models
(FM), yet to date their performance on cell phenotyping has not been
benchmarked in a unified manner. We therefore propose PhenoBench: A
comprehensive benchmark for cell phenotyping on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
stained histopathology images. We provide both PhenoCell, a new H&E dataset
featuring 14 granular cell types identified by using multiplexed imaging, and
ready-to-use fine-tuning and benchmarking code that allows the systematic
evaluation of multiple prominent pathology FMs in terms of dense cell phenotype
predictions in different generalization scenarios. We perform extensive
benchmarking of existing FMs, providing insights into their generalization
behavior under technical vs. medical domain shifts. Furthermore, while FMs
achieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as
Lizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20. This
indicates a much more challenging task not captured by previous benchmarks,
establishing PhenoCell as a prime asset for future benchmarking of FMs and
supervised models alike. Code and data are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: CLOT提出了一种基于最优传输（OT）的新框架，通过多级循环特征学习机制改进无监督动作分割，解决了ASOT缺乏段级监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASOT在无监督动作分割中表现优异，但缺乏段级监督限制了帧与动作表示之间的反馈效果。

Method: CLOT通过编码器-解码器架构，解决两个独立的OT问题，学习伪标签和帧/段嵌入，并通过跨注意力机制优化帧嵌入和伪标签。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验证明了循环学习对无监督动作分割的有效性。

Conclusion: CLOT通过引入多级循环学习机制，显著提升了无监督动作分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised action segmentation has recently pushed its limits with ASOT, an
optimal transport (OT)-based method that simultaneously learns action
representations and performs clustering using pseudo-labels. Unlike other
OT-based approaches, ASOT makes no assumptions on the action ordering, and it
is able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy cost matrix
between video frames and action labels. However, the resulting segmentation
lacks segment-level supervision, which limits the effectiveness of the feedback
between frames and action representations. To address this limitation, we
propose Closed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework that
introduces a multi-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its
encoder-decoder architecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and
segment embeddings by solving two separate OT problems. It then refines both
frame embeddings and pseudo-labels through cross-attention between the learned
frame and segment embeddings, integrating a third OT problem. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of cyclical
learning for unsupervised action segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了通用基础模型（如CLIP、BLIP等）与领域特定人脸识别模型（如AdaFace、ArcFace）在人脸识别任务中的表现，发现领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优，但通用模型在上下文信息丰富的图像中表现更好，且两者融合能进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨通用基础模型与领域特定模型在人脸识别任务中的性能差异，并研究如何结合两者以提升识别准确性和可解释性。

Method: 通过多组实验，比较不同模型在多个基准数据集上的表现，并尝试通过分数级融合和可解释性分析优化结果。

Result: 领域特定模型在零样本任务中表现更优；通用模型在上下文丰富的图像中表现更好；两者融合显著提升低FMR下的准确率；基础模型还能增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合领域特定模型与通用基础模型能显著提升人脸识别性能，尤其是在低FMR和可解释性方面。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Text-based visual descriptors-ranging from simple class names to more
descriptive phrases-are widely used in visual concept discovery and image
classification with vision-language models (VLMs). Their effectiveness,
however, depends on a complex interplay of factors, including semantic clarity,
presence in the VLM's pre-training data, and how well the descriptors serve as
a meaningful representation space. In this work, we systematically analyze
descriptor quality along two key dimensions: (1) representational capacity, and
(2) relationship with VLM pre-training data. We evaluate a spectrum of
descriptor generation methods, from zero-shot LLM-generated prompts to
iteratively refined descriptors. Motivated by ideas from representation
alignment and language understanding, we introduce two alignment-based
metrics-Global Alignment and CLIP Similarity-that move beyond accuracy. These
metrics allow us to shed light on how different descriptor generation
strategies interact with foundation model properties, offering insights into
ways of studying descriptor effectiveness beyond accuracy evaluations.

Motivation: 脑卒中是全球死亡和长期残疾的主要原因之一，需要快速准确的预测技术。传统诊断方法依赖人工选择CT切片，机器学习为改进诊断提供了新途径。

Method: 使用预训练模型（如DenseNet201、MobileNetV2等）进行特征提取，结合BFO、PCA和LDA等特征工程技术，再用SVC、RF等分类器进行分类。

Conclusion: 轻量级预训练模型结合优化和分类技术可有效提升脑卒中诊断效果。

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Motivation: 路面抗滑性能对道路安全至关重要，但传统测量方法复杂且昂贵，需要一种简单、低成本的方法。

Method: 使用三种沥青路面样本，通过轮胎抛光循环处理后，采集图像并测量摩擦系数，提出集料突出面积作为指标。

Result: 统计模型显示，指标与摩擦系数的相关性调整R平方值均高于0.90，优于其他图像指标。

Conclusion: 该图像指标能准确反映路面摩擦变化，为混合料设计阶段提供经济有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Pavement skid resistance is of vital importance for road safety. The
objective of this study is to propose and validate a texture-based image
indicator to predict pavement friction. This index enables pavement friction to
be measured easily and inexpensively using digital images. Three different
types of asphalt surfaces (dense-graded asphalt mix, open-grade friction
course, and chip seal) were evaluated subject to various tire polishing cycles.
Images were taken with corresponding friction measured using Dynamic Friction
Tester (DFT) in the laboratory. The aggregate protrusion area is proposed as
the indicator. Statistical models are established for each asphalt surface type
to correlate the proposed indicator with friction coefficients. The results
show that the adjusted R-square values of all relationships are above 0.90.
Compared to other image-based indicators in the literature, the proposed image
indicator more accurately reflects the changes in pavement friction with the
number of polishing cycles, proving its cost-effective use for considering
pavement friction in mix design stage.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的传感器可能被遮挡或视野受限，路边基础设施感知系统可以提供补充信息，但传统3D目标检测算法在俯视角下泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用2.5D目标检测框架，检测车辆地面的平行四边形，保留平面位置、大小和方向，忽略高度。训练数据结合真实和合成场景。

Result: 模型在未见过的视角和恶劣天气下表现出高检测精度、强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了可靠的路边感知解决方案，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid

Result: 在四个公共数据集上验证，平均Dice分数提升6.2点，Hausdorff距离减少15.8 mm，且仅使用9%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: 为构建鲁棒、高效且交互可控的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分析面临标记数据少、高维度和缺乏可扩展模型的问题，现有自监督学习方法未能充分捕捉时空依赖性。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，利用V-JEPA框架学习时空表示，采用联合嵌入和自适应掩码技术。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架，支持人机协作诊断。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注文本模态的原型学习，忽略了类名的语义模糊性，导致原型无法充分捕捉视觉概念。

Method: ProtoMM通过将原型视为文本描述和视觉粒子的离散分布，动态更新视觉粒子，并结合最优传输问题量化原型与测试图像的语义距离。

Result: 在15个零样本基准测试中，ProtoMM平均准确率提升1.03%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMM通过多模态原型学习和动态更新机制，显著提升了模型在未见场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: With the increasing attention to pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs),
\eg, CLIP, substantial efforts have been devoted to many downstream tasks,
especially in test-time adaptation (TTA). However, previous works focus on
learning prototypes only in the textual modality while overlooking the
ambiguous semantics in class names. These ambiguities lead to textual
prototypes that are insufficient to capture visual concepts, resulting in
limited performance. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{ProtoMM}, a
training-free framework that constructs multimodal prototypes to adapt VLMs
during the test time. By viewing the prototype as a discrete distribution over
the textual descriptions and visual particles, ProtoMM has the ability to
combine the multimodal features for comprehensive prototype learning. More
importantly, the visual particles are dynamically updated as the testing stream
flows. This allows our multimodal prototypes to continually learn from the
data, enhancing their generalizability in unseen scenarios. In addition, we
quantify the importance of the prototypes and test images by formulating their
semantic distance as an optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on 15
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a
1.03\% average accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet
and its variant datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉嵌入模型是否能通过线性方向捕捉连续的序数属性，并验证其实际应用潜力。

Method: 通过7种流行编码器和9个数据集，分析嵌入模型在年龄、人群数量等属性上的排名能力。

Result: 许多嵌入模型具有内在的排名能力，仅需少量样本即可恢复有意义的排名轴。

Conclusion: 研究为图像排名在向量数据库中的应用提供了新思路，并推动了对可排名嵌入结构的进一步研究。

Abstract: We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal
attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a
model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis
preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with
attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find
that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of
samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful
rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases
for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the
structure and learning of rankable embeddings. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAMed-2是一种基于SAM-2架构的医学图像分割基础模型，通过引入时间适配器和置信驱动记忆机制，解决了医学数据复杂性、噪声标注和多模态学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临数据复杂、标注噪声大以及多模态持续学习的挑战，需要一种更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 提出SAMed-2模型，包含时间适配器和置信驱动记忆机制，用于捕捉图像关联和存储高置信度特征。

Result: 在MedBank-100k数据集和10个外部数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAMed-2在多任务医学图像分割中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent "segment anything" efforts show promise by learning from large-scale
data, but adapting such models directly to medical images remains challenging
due to the complexity of medical data, noisy annotations, and continual
learning requirements across diverse modalities and anatomical structures. In
this work, we propose SAMed-2, a new foundation model for medical image
segmentation built upon the SAM-2 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a
temporal adapter into the image encoder to capture image correlations and a
confidence-driven memory mechanism to store high-certainty features for later
retrieval. This memory-based strategy counters the pervasive noise in
large-scale medical datasets and mitigates catastrophic forgetting when
encountering new tasks or modalities. To train and evaluate SAMed-2, we curate
MedBank-100k, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven imaging modalities and 21
medical segmentation tasks. Our experiments on both internal benchmarks and 10
external datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines in multi-task scenarios. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）提升手语识别质量，解决了词汇不灵活和模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手语翻译中的数据稀缺问题，提升手语识别的准确性和句子流畅性。

Method: 提取全局时空和手形特征，通过动态时间规整和余弦相似度匹配大规模手语词典，利用LLM进行上下文感知的消歧。

Result: 在合成和真实手语数据集上表现出更高的准确性和句子流畅性。

Conclusion: LLMs在手语识别中具有显著潜力，无需微调即可提升性能。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跌倒检测系统要么侵入性强，要么计算资源需求高，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 通过视频数据提取跌倒特征，使用简化的LSTM网络，减少计算需求。

Result: 计算需求降低18倍，准确率达88%。

Conclusion: 该系统适合工业和住宅安全领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Existing pre-impact fall detection systems have high accuracy, however they
are either intrusive to the subject or require heavy computational resources
for fall detection, resulting in prohibitive deployment costs. These factors
limit the global adoption of existing fall detection systems. In this work we
present a Pre-impact fall detection system that is both non-intrusive and
computationally efficient at deployment. Our system utilizes video data of the
locality available through cameras, thereby requiring no specialized equipment
to be worn by the subject. Further, the fall detection system utilizes minimal
fall specific features and simplistic neural network models, designed to reduce
the computational cost of the system. A minimal set of fall specific features
are derived from the skeletal data, post observing the relative position of
human skeleton during fall. These features are shown to have different
distributions for Fall and non-fall scenarios proving their discriminative
capability. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based network is selected and the
network architecture and training parameters are designed after evaluation of
performance on standard datasets. In the Pre-impact fall detection system the
computation requirement is about 18 times lesser than existing modules with a
comparable accuracy of 88%. Given the low computation requirements and higher
accuracy levels, the proposed system is suitable for wider adoption in
engineering systems related to industrial and residential safety.

Motivation: 当前纯视觉GUI代理在数据预训练中忽视了上下文建模的挑战，尤其是无关元素和高冗余历史信息的影响。

Method: 采用掩码元素剪枝减少无关元素干扰，设计一致性引导的历史压缩模块优化历史信息建模。

Result: SimpAgent减少了27%的FLOPs，并在多种GUI导航任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: SimpAgent框架在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，展示了其在GUI代理中的潜力。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

TL;DR: S3PO-GS是一种鲁棒的RGB-only室外3DGS SLAM方法，解决了现有方法在几何先验和尺度漂移上的不足，通过自一致跟踪模块和动态映射模块提升了跟踪精度和场景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS SLAM方法在室外场景中缺乏几何先验或存在尺度漂移问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出自一致跟踪模块和基于补丁的动态映射模块，避免尺度漂移并引入几何先验。

Result: 在Waymo、KITTI和DL3DV数据集上，S3PO-GS在新视角合成和跟踪精度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: S3PO-GS显著提升了复杂室外环境下的SLAM性能，具有更高的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM due to its
high-fidelity and real-time novel view synthesis performance. However, some
previous 3DGS SLAM methods employ a differentiable rendering pipeline for
tracking, \textbf{lack geometric priors} in outdoor scenes. Other approaches
introduce separate tracking modules, but they accumulate errors with
significant camera movement, leading to \textbf{scale drift}. To address these
challenges, we propose a robust RGB-only outdoor 3DGS SLAM method: S3PO-GS.
Technically, we establish a self-consistent tracking module anchored in the
3DGS pointmap, which avoids cumulative scale drift and achieves more precise
and robust tracking with fewer iterations. Additionally, we design a
patch-based pointmap dynamic mapping module, which introduces geometric priors
while avoiding scale ambiguity. This significantly enhances tracking accuracy
and the quality of scene reconstruction, making it particularly suitable for
complex outdoor environments. Our experiments on the Waymo, KITTI, and DL3DV
datasets demonstrate that S3PO-GS achieves state-of-the-art results in novel
view synthesis and outperforms other 3DGS SLAM methods in tracking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACM通过Flow-Anchoring策略解决CMs训练不稳定的问题，显著提升少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs)在少步生成中效率高，但训练不稳定，原因是模型失去了对瞬时速度场的把握。

Method: 提出Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM)，利用Flow Matching任务作为锚点，无需修改架构。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，NFE=2时FID为1.32，NFE=1时为1.76，性能领先。

Conclusion: FACM为高性能少步生成模型提供了通用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous-time Consistency Models (CMs) promise efficient few-step
generation but face significant challenges with training instability. We argue
this instability stems from a fundamental conflict: by training a network to
learn only a shortcut across a probability flow, the model loses its grasp on
the instantaneous velocity field that defines the flow. Our solution is to
explicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training. We
introduce the Flow-Anchored Consistency Model (FACM), a simple but effective
training strategy that uses a Flow Matching (FM) task as an anchor for the
primary CM shortcut objective. This Flow-Anchoring approach requires no
architectural modifications and is broadly compatible with standard model
architectures. By distilling a pre-trained LightningDiT model, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.32 with two steps (NFE=2) and 1.76 with
just one step (NFE=1) on ImageNet 256x256, significantly outperforming previous
methods. This provides a general and effective recipe for building
high-performance, few-step generative models. Our code and pretrained models:

Conclusion: ChestGPT作为辅助工具，可减轻放射科医生负担，提供初步诊断结果和病灶定位。

Abstract: The global demand for radiologists is increasing rapidly due to a growing
reliance on medical imaging services, while the supply of radiologists is not
keeping pace. Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies
present significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'
capabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),
particularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the
primary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,
vision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into
a format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,
a deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to
classify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The
ViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with
engineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and
localization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning
techniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method
achieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR
dataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by
generating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline
several task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for
scenarios radiologists might encounter. Overall, this framework offers an
assistive tool that can lighten radiologists' workload by providing preliminary
findings and regions of interest to facilitate their diagnostic process.

Result: 训练了一个4B参数的模型，经过蒸馏后实现16 FPS的实时性能，支持512p分辨率视频流生成。

Conclusion: StreamDiT为实时视频生成应用（如流媒体生成和交互生成）提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用事件和帧数据的互补信息，导致训练复杂且计算成本高。

Method: 采用混合框架，包含SNN分支和ANN分支，引入ATW Injector、EDS Injector和CSF模块优化特征融合。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最佳精度，能耗降低65%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且节能，为事件和帧数据的融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Event cameras have recently been introduced into image semantic segmentation,
owing to their high temporal resolution and other advantageous properties.
However, existing event-based semantic segmentation methods often fail to fully
exploit the complementary information provided by frames and events, resulting
in complex training strategies and increased computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose an efficient hybrid framework for image semantic
segmentation, comprising a Spiking Neural Network branch for events and an
Artificial Neural Network branch for frames. Specifically, we introduce three
specialized modules to facilitate the interaction between these two branches:
the Adaptive Temporal Weighting (ATW) Injector, the Event-Driven Sparse (EDS)
Injector, and the Channel Selection Fusion (CSF) module. The ATW Injector
dynamically integrates temporal features from event data into frame features,
enhancing segmentation accuracy by leveraging critical dynamic temporal
information. The EDS Injector effectively combines sparse event data with rich
frame features, ensuring precise temporal and spatial information alignment.
The CSF module selectively merges these features to optimize segmentation
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across the DDD17-Seg, DSEC-Semantic, and
M3ED-Semantic datasets but also significantly reduces energy consumption,
achieving a 65\% reduction on the DSEC-Semantic dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的DINOv2预训练策略，通过频率过滤课程和高斯噪声补丁增强，加速收敛并提高鲁棒性，同时减少计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉基础模型（如DINOv2）需要大量计算资源，难以在私有数据或新模态上复现。本文旨在提出一种更高效的预训练方法。

Method: 采用频率过滤课程（低频优先）和高斯噪声补丁增强策略，应用于ViT-B/16架构，在ImageNet-1K上进行训练。

Result: 预训练时间和FLOPs分别减少1.6倍和2.25倍，同时在ImageNet-C上保持鲁棒性，线性探测性能与基线相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和鲁棒性上取得双重优势，为大规模自监督基础模型提供了更可行的解决方案，并探索了数据课程和增强对模型鲁棒性的影响。

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training
solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific
questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus
propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Motivation: 随着ViT在安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）中的普及，确保其在位翻转故障下的正确功能变得至关重要。

Method: 将参数的最低位替换为奇偶校验位以检测错误，并在检测到故障时通过将受影响参数置零来屏蔽故障。

Result: 该方法将ViT模型对位翻转的鲁棒性提升了三个数量级，且无内存开销。

Conclusion: 该零开销容错技术有效提升了ViT在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as
classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of
self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality
becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their
parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is
introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory
overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for
model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection
mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected,
affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models
are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach
enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters
to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective
zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.

Motivation: 现有VPR方法通常在单一数据集上训练，导致模型泛化能力受限；多数据集联合训练虽有望解决此问题，但特征聚合层的信息容量有限，影响性能。

Method: 提出QAA技术，利用学习到的查询作为参考码本，通过计算跨查询相似性（CS）生成鲁棒描述符，增强信息容量。

Result: QAA在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现平衡的泛化能力，同时保持与数据集专用模型相当的峰值性能。

Conclusion: QAA通过高效的特征聚合机制，显著提升了VPR模型的泛化能力，为多数据集训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced
significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing
approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce
dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While
multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing
universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate limited
information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive
Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned
queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity
without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that
computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features
and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust
descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art
models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while
maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation
studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal
that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.
Code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Abstract: This work focuses on modeling dynamic urban environments for autonomous
driving simulation. Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance
fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer
from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D
Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity
reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect
to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading
to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that
exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance
refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach
is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of
transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple
granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and
dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations
between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained
changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and
VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: HSVF通过双流协作有效解决了长距离雾霾去除问题，并提供了新的数据集支持研究。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Abstract: Recently, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising solution to
mitigate distribution-shift issue in sensor-based human activity recognition
(HAR) scenario. However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on
modeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,
neglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every
sensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and
non-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity
classification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a
casual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation
learning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an
early-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are
respectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an
independence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to
implicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling
strategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain
perturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive
experiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our
causality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related
state-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and
cross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal
underlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and
universality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.

Result: 在Real3D-AD和Anomaly-ShapeNet数据集上，Object-level AUROC分别达到79.9%和79.5%，Point-level AUROC分别达到71.2%和84.7%。

Conclusion: DUS-Net通过保留几何结构和多尺度特征融合，显著提升了3D异常检测的性能，成为当前最佳方法。

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D
anomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling
high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In
this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct
high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group
center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation
module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training
data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a
Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center
point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling
Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by
fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for
construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a
more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an
Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and
84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Human animation recently has advanced rapidly, achieving increasingly
realistic and vivid results, especially with the integration of large-scale
video generation models. However, the slow inference speed and high
computational cost of these large models bring significant challenges for
practical applications. Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as
lip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start
and end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of
large video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important
question: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in
generalization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,
we dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the
details: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for
human animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local
reconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the
interplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and
audio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse
multi-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward
alternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters
to achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters
count. Through these innovations, our work paves the way for efficient,
high-quality, and versatile digital human generation, addressing both
performance and practicality challenges in the field. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EchoMimicV3 outperforms existing models in both facial and
semi-body video generation, providing precise text-based control for creating
videos in a wide range of scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLMs在放射学报告生成中更注重语言流畅性而非临床有效性，且难以捕捉X光图像与文本的关系。

Method: 提出OTDRG框架，通过OT对齐图像与标签特征，并设计疾病预测模块。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU X-Ray数据集上，OTDRG在自然语言生成和临床效果指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OTDRG不仅生成语言连贯的报告，还提高了临床准确性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation represents a significant application within
medical AI, and has achieved impressive results. Concurrently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains.
However, empirical validation indicates that general LLMs tend to focus more on
linguistic fluency rather than clinical effectiveness, and lack the ability to
effectively capture the relationship between X-ray images and their
corresponding texts, thus resulting in poor clinical practicability. To address
these challenges, we propose Optimal Transport-Driven Radiology Report
Generation (OTDRG), a novel framework that leverages Optimal Transport (OT) to
align image features with disease labels extracted from reports, effectively
bridging the cross-modal gap. The core component of OTDRG is Alignment \&
Fine-Tuning, where OT utilizes results from the encoding of label features and
image visual features to minimize cross-modal distances, then integrating image
and text features for LLMs fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a novel disease
prediction module to predict disease labels contained in X-ray images during
validation and testing. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets, OTDRG
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both natural language generation (NLG)
and clinical efficacy (CE) metrics, delivering reports that are not only
linguistically coherent but also clinically accurate.

Conclusion: CSDS框架有效解决了染色和组织结构的变异性问题，为腺体分割提供了新方法。

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DNF-Intrinsic明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNF-Intrinsic通过改进输入和约束机制，实现了高质量且鲁棒的逆渲染。

Abstract: Recent methods have shown that pre-trained diffusion models can be fine-tuned
to enable generative inverse rendering by learning image-conditioned
noise-to-intrinsic mapping. Despite their remarkable progress, they struggle to
robustly produce high-quality results as the noise-to-intrinsic paradigm
essentially utilizes noisy images with deteriorated structure and appearance
for intrinsic prediction, while it is common knowledge that structure and
appearance information in an image are crucial for inverse rendering. To
address this issue, we present DNF-Intrinsic, a robust yet efficient inverse
rendering approach fine-tuned from a pre-trained diffusion model, where we
propose to take the source image rather than Gaussian noise as input to
directly predict deterministic intrinsic properties via flow matching.
Moreover, we design a generative renderer to constrain that the predicted
intrinsic properties are physically faithful to the source image. Experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ASEA通过动态节点选择和外部注意力机制，显著提升了交互建模的适应性和效果。

Abstract: Most GCN-based methods model interacting individuals as independent graphs,
neglecting their inherent inter-dependencies. Although recent approaches
utilize predefined interaction adjacency matrices to integrate participants,
these matrices fail to adaptively capture the dynamic and context-specific
joint interactions across different actions. In this paper, we propose the
Active Node Selection with External Attention Network (ASEA), an innovative
approach that dynamically captures interaction relationships without predefined
assumptions. Our method models each participant individually using a GCN to
capture intra-personal relationships, facilitating a detailed representation of
their actions. To identify the most relevant nodes for interaction modeling, we
introduce the Adaptive Temporal Node Amplitude Calculation (AT-NAC) module,
which estimates global node activity by combining spatial motion magnitude with
adaptive temporal weighting, thereby highlighting salient motion patterns while
reducing irrelevant or redundant information. A learnable threshold,
regularized to prevent extreme variations, is defined to selectively identify
the most informative nodes for interaction modeling. To capture interactions,
we design the External Attention (EA) module to operate on active nodes,
effectively modeling the interaction dynamics and semantic relationships
between individuals. Extensive evaluations show that our method captures
interaction relationships more effectively and flexibly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This work proposes a mmWave radar's scene flow estimation framework
supervised by data from a widespread visual-inertial (VI) sensor suite,
allowing crowdsourced training data from smart vehicles. Current scene flow
estimation methods for mmWave radar are typically supervised by dense point
clouds from 3D LiDARs, which are expensive and not widely available in smart
vehicles. While VI data are more accessible, visual images alone cannot capture
the 3D motions of moving objects, making it difficult to supervise their scene
flow. Moreover, the temporal drift of VI rigid transformation also degenerates
the scene flow estimation of static points. To address these challenges, we
propose a drift-free rigid transformation estimator that fuses kinematic
model-based ego-motions with neural network-learned results. It provides strong
supervision signals to radar-based rigid transformation and infers the scene
flow of static points. Then, we develop an optical-mmWave supervision
extraction module that extracts the supervision signals of radar rigid
transformation and scene flow. It strengthens the supervision by learning the
scene flow of dynamic points with the joint constraints of optical and mmWave
radar measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in smoke-filled
environments, our method even outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches
using costly LiDARs.

Abstract: Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an
important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise
present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often
struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to
consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art
methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative
solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color
distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework
(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting
conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an
illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a
specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition
field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light
conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of
illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more
effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.
To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a
low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview
consistency on standard benchmarks. The codes and data are available at

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂驾驶环境中的OOD语义分割提供了鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the
reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road
environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which
significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic
segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive
analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios
where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle:
(1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small
objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented
challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in
road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning
capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection
through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with
observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard
benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset,
offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in
complex driving environments.

Abstract: Birds' Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is an indispensable perception
task in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform
due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we
explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance
the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our
preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises
efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data
from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning
framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry
Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance
capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from
the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and
the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel
Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,
where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of
multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts
semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to
realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic
Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity
inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest
improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV
segmentation tasks, respectively. The source code will be made publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGFAS方法仅对齐局部决策边界的权重，而偏置未对齐导致分类阈值不一致和目标域性能下降。

Method: 结合FOD（特征正交分解）和GS-RM（组尺度风险最小化）联合对齐权重和偏置，并引入ECE作为评估指标。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，提升了准确性，减少了偏置未对齐，增强了泛化稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了偏置未对齐问题，显著提升了DGFAS的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture
domain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local
decision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with
these boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification
thresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this
issue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and
biases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling
Risk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by
balancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space
explicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing
orthogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during
training using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across
domains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce
Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms
across domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving
accuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on
unseen target domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生境评估依赖专家实地调查，成本高且效率低，AI驱动的自动化工具可优化此过程。地面级图像能捕捉空中遥感无法获取的结构和组成信息。

Method: 使用英国Countryside Survey数据，评估CNN和ViT在监督和监督对比学习范式下的性能。

Result: ViT在分类指标上优于CNN（Top-3准确率91%，MCC=0.66），监督对比学习减少相似生境的误分类。模型性能接近专家水平。

Conclusion: 结合AI与生态专业知识，为地面级生境监测提供了可扩展、经济高效的框架，助力生物多样性保护和土地利用决策。

Abstract: Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and
guiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can
be costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine
this process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,
it is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.
In contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and
compositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,
fine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying
state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat
imagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad
habitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and
supervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification
metrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene
understanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive
learning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar
habitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more
discriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with
experienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,
underscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating
advanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,
cost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate
biodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 替换ViT中的MLPs，以解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。实验表明，KAN-based ViTs在知识保留和任务适应上优于传统MLP-based ViTs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，灾难性遗忘是ViTs使用MLPs时的关键挑战，需要一种能保留旧知识并适应新任务的方法。

Method: 用KANs替换ViTs中的MLPs，利用基于样条的激活函数实现局部可塑性，减少参数更新范围。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR100数据集上，KAN-based ViTs显著减轻了灾难性遗忘，表现优于传统MLP-based ViTs。

Conclusion: KANs与ViTs的结合为动态环境中的鲁棒和适应性模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), the ability of a model to learn new tasks without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a critical challenge in
artificial intelligence, particularly for vision transformers (ViTs) utilizing
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for global representation learning. Catastrophic
forgetting, where new information overwrites prior knowledge, is especially
problematic in these models. This research proposes replacing MLPs in ViTs with
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KANs) to address this issue. KANs leverage local
plasticity through spline-based activations, ensuring that only a subset of
parameters is updated per sample, thereby preserving previously learned
knowledge. The study investigates the efficacy of KAN-based ViTs in CL
scenarios across benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100), focusing on their
ability to retain accuracy on earlier tasks while adapting to new ones.
Experimental results demonstrate that KAN-based ViTs significantly mitigate
catastrophic forgetting, outperforming traditional MLP-based ViTs in knowledge
retention and task adaptation. This novel integration of KANs into ViTs
represents a promising step toward more robust and adaptable models for dynamic
environments.

Motivation: 现有方法仅能生成静态幻灯片或文本摘要，无法满足动态演示需求，因此开发了能模拟人类风格演示的多模态代理。

Result: 在30组文档-演示对上的实验表明，PresentAgent在所有评估指标上接近人类水平。

Conclusion: 可控多模态代理在将静态文本转换为动态演示方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: We present PresentAgent, a multimodal agent that transforms long-form
documents into narrated presentation videos. While existing approaches are
limited to generating static slides or text summaries, our method advances
beyond these limitations by producing fully synchronized visual and spoken
content that closely mimics human-style presentations. To achieve this
integration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically
segments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,
generates contextual spoken narration with large language models and
Text-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise
audio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal
outputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by
Vision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical
dimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension
through prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated
dataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent
approaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics. These results
highlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in
transforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible
presentation formats. Code will be available at

this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast

Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言模型局限于静态观察，缺乏主动感知能力，MTU3D旨在解决这一问题，实现智能体对环境的主动探索与理解。

Method: 1) 在线查询表示学习；2) 统一目标优化；3) 端到端轨迹学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MTU3D的成功率比现有方法提升了14%至23%。

Conclusion: MTU3D展示了视觉定位与探索结合对智能体理解环境的重要性。

Abstract: Embodied scene understanding requires not only comprehending visual-spatial
information that has been observed but also determining where to explore next
in the 3D physical world. Existing 3D Vision-Language (3D-VL) models primarily
focus on grounding objects in static observations from 3D reconstruction, such
as meshes and point clouds, but lack the ability to actively perceive and
explore their environment. To address this limitation, we introduce
\underline{\textbf{M}}ove \underline{\textbf{t}}o
\underline{\textbf{U}}nderstand (\textbf{\model}), a unified framework that
integrates active perception with \underline{\textbf{3D}} vision-language
learning, enabling embodied agents to effectively explore and understand their
environment. This is achieved by three key innovations: 1) Online query-based
representation learning, enabling direct spatial memory construction from RGB-D
frames, eliminating the need for explicit 3D reconstruction. 2) A unified
objective for grounding and exploring, which represents unexplored locations as
frontier queries and jointly optimizes object grounding and frontier selection.
3) End-to-end trajectory learning that combines
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{E}xploration pre-training over a
million diverse trajectories collected from both simulated and real-world RGB-D
sequences. Extensive evaluations across various embodied navigation and
question-answering benchmarks show that MTU3D outperforms state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning and modular navigation approaches by 14\%, 23\%, 9\%,
and 2\% in success rate on HM3D-OVON, GOAT-Bench, SG3D, and A-EQA,
respectively. \model's versatility enables navigation using diverse input
modalities, including categories, language descriptions, and reference images.
These findings highlight the importance of bridging visual grounding and
exploration for embodied intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习依赖单一专家演示，导致行为保守且同质化，难以适应复杂现实场景。

Method: 通过扩散生成机制生成多样轨迹，结合强化学习引入奖励监督，确保安全性和多样性。

Result: 在NAVSIM、Bench2Drive和nuScenes数据集上验证，显著提升轨迹多样性，解决模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: DIVER通过扩散生成和强化学习，有效提升自动驾驶轨迹的多样性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from
single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous
behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this
work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates
reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and
feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based
generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and
surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single
ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that
arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second,
reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where
reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the
generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization
capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop
metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric
to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on
the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop
nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory
diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in
imitation learning.

Conclusion: DiffGRE通过合成数据和多阶段优化，显著提升了在线类别发现的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a practical yet challenging task: On-the-fly
Category Discovery (OCD). This task focuses on the online identification of
newly arriving stream data that may belong to both known and unknown
categories, utilizing the category knowledge from only labeled data. Existing
OCD methods are devoted to fully mining transferable knowledge from only
labeled data. However, the transferability learned by these methods is limited
because the knowledge contained in known categories is often insufficient,
especially when few annotated data/categories are available in fine-grained
recognition. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based OCD
framework, dubbed DiffGRE, which integrates Generation, Refinement, and
Encoding in a multi-stage fashion. Specifically, we first design an
attribute-composition generation method based on cross-image interpolation in
the diffusion latent space to synthesize novel samples. Then, we propose a
diversity-driven refinement approach to select the synthesized images that
differ from known categories for subsequent OCD model training. Finally, we
leverage a semi-supervised leader encoding to inject additional category
knowledge contained in synthesized data into the OCD models, which can benefit
the discovery of both known and unknown categories during the on-the-fly
inference process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
DiffGRE over previous methods on six fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: TCL框架能有效解决HMP中的问题，且易于集成到不同模型和应用中。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the
multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the
video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant
advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains
(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains
(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain
generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose
deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection
on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly
focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial
to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For
some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis
relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in
each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this
fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of
misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization
model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation
detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We
involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a
shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal
learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core
features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through
cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 通过STAB和ACB记忆库及AAA策略，有效提升了动作驱动运动预测的准确性和合理性。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-performing solution to the UAVM 2025
Challenge, which focuses on matching narrow FOV street-level images to
corresponding satellite imagery using the University-1652 dataset. As panoramic
Cross-View Geo-Localisation nears peak performance, it becomes increasingly
important to explore more practical problem formulations. Real-world scenarios
rarely offer panoramic street-level queries; instead, queries typically consist
of limited-FOV images captured with unknown camera parameters. Our work
prioritises discovering the highest achievable performance under these
constraints, pushing the limits of existing architectures. Our method begins by
retrieving candidate satellite image embeddings for a given query, followed by
a re-ranking stage that selectively enhances retrieval accuracy within the top
candidates. This two-stage approach enables more precise matching, even under
the significant viewpoint and scale variations inherent in the task. Through
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results
-specifically attaining R@1 and R@10 retrieval rates of \topone\% and \topten\%
respectively. This underscores the potential of optimised retrieval and
re-ranking strategies in advancing practical geo-localisation performance. Code

Motivation: 解决在复杂环境和动态场景中多目标跟踪的挑战，如轨迹中断、动态参数学习和目标分类。

Method: 利用高斯过程作为运动模型，非齐次泊松过程作为观测模型，结合粒子滤波和MCMC核实现轨迹恢复与拼接。

Result: GaPP-ReaCtion显著减少轨迹中断（如真实雷达数据中减少30%），性能优于现有算法。

Conclusion: GaPP-Class和GaPP-ReaCtion在复杂场景中表现优异，适用于动态跟踪和分类任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking
approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and
against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g.,
in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if
joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises
on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion
model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the
proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly
introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process
with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification
(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme
that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning
(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class
with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle
permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after
deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic
and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other
state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly
reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly
more from simulated data).

Conclusion: PromptSR通过结合全局先验和局部细节，显著扩大了接收域，同时保持低计算成本。

Abstract: Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image
super-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive
field due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic
computational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a
large window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel
prompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the
proposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information
access and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global
anchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL
leverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor
prompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing
computational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used
to provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token
connections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention
and window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a
coarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional
global prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different
granularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB
effectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging
the receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our
PromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,
which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,
qualitative, and complexity evaluations. Our code will be released at

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像合成方法依赖大量人工标注数据且难以精确控制复杂视觉属性和空间关系，Hi-SSLVLM旨在通过自监督学习解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段自监督学习：第一阶段通过多粒度视觉-语言对齐生成层次化标题；第二阶段利用内部组合规划机制和语义一致性损失指导图像生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于主流模型，如Janus-Pro-1B和Stable Diffusion XL 1.0，并在人类评估中表现出更高的生成质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: Hi-SSLVLM在可控性和语义一致性方面取得显著进展，为开放式文本到图像生成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hierarchical Self-Supervised LVLM (Hi-SSLVLM), a novel
generative model designed to significantly advance text-to-image synthesis,
particularly for complex and compositionally challenging prompts. Traditional
methods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired
image-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual
attributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these
limitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The
first stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align
hierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal
semantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The
second stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this
acquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where
the LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image
generation process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for
precise output alignment. Comprehensive experiments against leading baselines,
including Janus-Pro-1B, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, DeepFloyd IF v1.0, and
ControlNet-XL, on multi-dimensional benchmarks such as Gemini-2.0-Flash and
InternVL3-78B, demonstrate Hi-SSLVLM's superior performance across all
fine-grained metrics. An in-depth ablation study confirms the critical role of
each proposed component. Furthermore, human evaluations corroborate our
quantitative findings, highlighting Hi-SSLVLM's enhanced fidelity to prompt,
compositional accuracy, and overall aesthetic quality, marking a significant
step towards more controllable and semantically consistent open-ended
text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: LVLM-Composer为可控且组合准确的文本到图像生成迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The burgeoning field of generative artificial intelligence has fundamentally
reshaped our approach to content creation, with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) standing at its forefront. While current LVLMs have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in text-to-image generation, they often falter when
confronted with complex textual descriptions demanding precise compositional
understanding and visual planning. This limitation particularly impacts the
accurate rendering of multiple objects, their attributes, spatial
relationships, and specific poses within intricate scenes, as evidenced by
benchmarks like LongBench-T2I. To address these challenges, we introduce
LVLM-Composer, a novel 10-billion parameter scale LVLM specifically engineered
for enhanced compositional image synthesis. Our method incorporates a
Hierarchical Semantic Planning Module for structured prompt decomposition and a
Fine-Grained Feature Alignment Mechanism for precise visual guidance during
generation. We propose a multi-stage training paradigm, featuring Hierarchical
Semantic-Visual Grounding Pre-training and Compositional Planning Reinforcement
Learning with Self-Correction, to instill robust compositional reasoning.
Extensive experiments on the LongBench-T2I benchmark, utilizing automatic
evaluation by Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B, demonstrate LVLM-Composer's
superior performance across critical compositional dimensions including object
accuracy, composition fidelity, and pose accuracy, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth ablation study further validates the
indispensable contribution of our proposed modules, while human evaluations
confirm the perceptual superiority of our generated images. LVLM-Composer
represents a significant step towards truly controllable and compositionally
accurate open-ended text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 研究从单视图生成无边界动态场景的问题，应用于增强/虚拟现实和机器人领域。现有方法因依赖多视图训练，生成场景受限。

Method: 将单视图视频映射为动态点云，利用射线上下文外绘视频以生成3D一致运动，并通过更新点云实现无边界场景生成。

Result: 实验表明，模型能生成具有一致运动的无边界场景，且可通过场景提示控制生成内容。

Conclusion: DynamicVoyager通过射线上下文和点云更新，有效解决了单视图动态场景生成的3D一致性问题。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of generating an unbounded dynamic scene from
a single view, which has wide applications in augmented/virtual reality and
robotics. Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need
to be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn
such consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions
are bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To
address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic
scene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D
outpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D
pixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input
with the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the
ray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to
a dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the
partial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the
point cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video
to update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future
novel views. Experiments show that our model is able to generate unbounded
scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras, and the generated
contents can be controlled with scene prompts.

Result: 动态范围扩展了一个数量级，信噪比显著提升，数字分块在高增益下表现优于模拟分块。

Conclusion: 空间变化的增益和分块技术有效提升了图像传感器的性能，适用于高动态范围成像等应用。

Abstract: Pixels in image sensors have progressively become smaller, driven by the goal
of producing higher-resolution imagery. However, ceteris paribus, a smaller
pixel accumulates less light, making image quality worse. This interplay of
resolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the
eventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.
In this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the
noise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by
varying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made
negligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of
magnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that
best balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis
predicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene
brightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %
without sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes
and, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog
counterparts when a larger gain is allowed. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining spatially-varying gain and binning in various applications, including
high dynamic range imaging, vignetting, and lens distortion.

Motivation: 现有零样本方法在图像恢复任务中迭代时间过长，限制了扩散模型的实际应用。

Method: 通过QBM从中间近似初始化以跳过早期去噪步骤，并通过RRP调整随机噪声权重以增强随机性。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CelebA-HQ上的实验表明，该方法能显著加速现有方法且不降低性能。

Conclusion: QBM和RRP有效解决了扩散模型在图像恢复任务中的效率问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success
in various image generation tasks. Building upon these achievements, diffusion
models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,
super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from
degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained
diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,
these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising
process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),
a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing
from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising
steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce
inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts
the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate
potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ
across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,
and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods
can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original
performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional
diffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency
information and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained
model are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.

Abstract: Laboratory mice play a crucial role in biomedical research, yet accurate 3D
mouse surface motion reconstruction remains challenging due to their complex
non-rigid geometric deformations and textureless appearance. Moreover, the
absence of structured 3D datasets severely hinders the progress beyond sparse
keypoint tracking. To narrow the gap, we present MoReMouse, the first monocular
dense 3D reconstruction network tailored for laboratory mice. To achieve this
goal, we highlight three key designs. First, we construct the first
high-fidelity dense-view synthetic dataset for mice, by rendering our
self-designed realistic Gaussian mouse avatar. Second, MoReMouse adopts a
transformer-based feedforward architecture with triplane representation,
achieving high-quality 3D surface generation from a single image. Third, we
create geodesic-based continuous correspondence embeddings on mouse surface,
which serve as strong semantic priors to improve reconstruction stability and
surface consistency. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that MoReMouse significantly outperforms existing open-source
methods in accuracy and robustness. Video results are available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10等基准测试中，GSTDS计算需求减少4倍，性能优于JEST等现有方法。

Conclusion: GSTDS展示了谱分析在高效深度学习中的潜力，为自适应数据管理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Conclusion: LiteIE是资源受限平台上高效实用的低光增强解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time low-light image enhancement on mobile and embedded devices requires
models that balance visual quality and computational efficiency. Existing deep
learning methods often rely on large networks and labeled datasets, limiting
their deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose
LiteIE, an ultra-lightweight unsupervised enhancement framework that eliminates
dependence on large-scale supervision and generalizes well across diverse

convolutional layers to produce compact image features enhancement tensors. In
addition, we develop a parameter-free Iterative Restoration Module, which
reuses the extracted features to progressively recover fine details lost in
earlier enhancement steps, without introducing any additional learnable
parameters. We further propose an unsupervised training objective that
integrates exposure control, edge-aware smoothness, and multi-scale color
consistency losses. Experiments on the LOL dataset, LiteIE achieves 19.04 dB
PSNR, surpassing SOTA by 1.4 dB while using only 0.07\% of its parameters. On a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile processor, LiteIE runs at 30 FPS for 4K images with
just 58 parameters, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. These
results establish LiteIE as an efficient and practical solution for low-light

TL;DR: SeqTex是一个端到端框架，直接生成UV纹理贴图，避免了传统两阶段方法的误差累积和空间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模高质量的3D纹理数据集，现有方法通常依赖后处理生成UV纹理贴图，导致误差累积和空间不一致。

Method: SeqTex利用预训练视频基础模型的视觉知识，将任务重新定义为序列生成问题，并引入多视图和UV分支设计、几何感知注意力等创新。

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端框架和创新的架构设计，成功解决了3D纹理生成中的一致性和效率问题。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

TL;DR: M3-Med是一个多语言、多模态、多跳推理的医学教学视频理解基准，旨在解决现有基准的语言单一性和浅层推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解基准局限于英语且缺乏深度推理能力，无法满足医学教育等专业领域的需求。

Method: M3-Med包含医学问题与视频片段配对，通过专家标注，设计了多跳推理任务，要求模型跨模态整合信息。

Result: 评估显示，现有模型与人类专家在复杂多跳推理任务上存在显著差距。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI在专业领域深度跨模态推理的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但高计算复杂度限制了其在边缘设备上的应用。现有量化方法在极低位量化下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed Quantization处理异常值，采用Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization优化初始化，并通过Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation保持时间一致性。

Result: 在各种生成任务上，MPQ-DMv2显著优于现有方法，尤其在极低位量化下表现突出。

Conclusion: MPQ-DMv2为极低位扩散模型提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance on vision
generation tasks. However, the high computational complexity hinders its wide
application on edge devices. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique
for inference acceleration and memory reduction. However, existing quantization
methods do not generalize well under extremely low-bit (2-4 bit) quantization.
Directly applying these methods will cause severe performance degradation. We
identify that the existing quantization framework suffers from the
outlier-unfriendly quantizer design, suboptimal initialization, and
optimization strategy. We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \textbf{M}ixed
\textbf{P}recision \textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the
imbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly
for uniform quantizer. We propose \textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed
Quantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible
quant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we
theoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and
propose \textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior
quantization error for informative initialization. We then propose
\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online
time-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information
distillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized
and full-precision model. Comprehensive experiments on various generation tasks
show that our MPQ-DMv2 surpasses current SOTA methods by a great margin on
different architectures, especially under extremely low-bit widths.

TL;DR: LEAwareSGD是一种基于Lyapunov Exponent的优化方法，通过动态调整学习率，使模型训练在混沌边缘附近进行，提升了单域泛化任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单域泛化（SDG）任务面临域偏移大和数据多样性不足的挑战，现有方法依赖数据增强但效果有限。

Method: 提出LEAwareSGD，利用Lyapunov Exponent测量动态调整学习率，使模型在混沌边缘附近训练，平衡稳定性和适应性。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet上的实验显示，LEAwareSGD显著提升泛化性能，PACS上最高提升9.47%。

Conclusion: 在混沌边缘附近训练能有效增强模型在SDG任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Result: DLCN数据集具有高多样性和真实性，为评估算法鲁棒性提供了宝贵资源。

Conclusion: DLCN数据集和Happy-rPPG工具包的发布有助于推动复杂条件下rPPG算法的研究。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact technique for measuring
human physiological signals. Due to its convenience and non-invasiveness, it
has demonstrated broad application potential in areas such as health monitoring
and emotion recognition. In recent years, the release of numerous public
datasets has significantly advanced the performance of rPPG algorithms under
ideal lighting conditions. However, the effectiveness of current rPPG methods
in realistic nighttime scenarios with dynamic lighting variations remains
largely unknown. Moreover, there is a severe lack of datasets specifically
designed for such challenging environments, which has substantially hindered
progress in this area of research. To address this gap, we present and release
a large-scale rPPG dataset collected under dynamic lighting conditions at
night, named DLCN. The dataset comprises approximately 13 hours of video data
and corresponding synchronized physiological signals from 98 participants,
covering four representative nighttime lighting scenarios. DLCN offers high
diversity and realism, making it a valuable resource for evaluating algorithm
robustness in complex conditions. Built upon the proposed Happy-rPPG Toolkit,
we conduct extensive experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of the
challenges faced by state-of-the-art rPPG methods when applied to DLCN. The
dataset and code are publicly available at

Result: DMAT在生成湍流的数据集上比现有方法性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: DMAT框架有效解决了AT引起的失真问题，同时提升了图像质量和目标检测性能。

Abstract: Atmospheric Turbulence (AT) degrades the clarity and accuracy of surveillance
imagery, posing challenges not only for visualization quality but also for
object classification and scene tracking. Deep learning-based methods have been
proposed to improve visual quality, but spatio-temporal distortions remain a
significant issue. Although deep learning-based object detection performs well
under normal conditions, it struggles to operate effectively on sequences
distorted by atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that learns to compensate for distorted features while simultaneously
improving visualization and object detection. This end-to-end framework
leverages and exchanges knowledge of low-level distorted features in the AT
mitigator with semantic features extracted in the object detector.
Specifically, in the AT mitigator a 3D Mamba-based structure is used to handle
the spatio-temporal displacements and blurring caused by turbulence. Features
are extracted in a pyramid manner during the mitigation stage and passed to the
detector. Optimization is achieved through back-propagation in both the AT
mitigator and object detector. Our proposed DMAT outperforms state-of-the-art
AT mitigation and object detection systems up to a 15% improvement on datasets
corrupted by generated turbulence.

Motivation: 现有医学VQA方法通常独立提取图像和文本特征，忽略了CT数据的空间连续性和切片间相关性，导致回答不精确。

Method: 构建跨模态图，将CT切片和问题标记作为节点，利用注意力图卷积网络动态融合信息，生成软提示以指导LLM生成答案。

Result: 在M3D-VQA基准测试中，该方法在多个评估指标上均优于基线模型，展现出更强的推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过图表示和LLM的结合，该方法显著提升了医学VQA的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有融合策略无法同时实现高效性、长距离建模和完整场景信息保留。

Method: 提出高度保真LiDAR编码和混合Mamba块，结合局部和全局上下文学习。

Result: 在nuScenes验证基准上取得75.0的NDS最高分，推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 方法在性能和效率上均达到最优，超越高分辨率输入方法。

Abstract: We present the first work demonstrating that a pure Mamba block can achieve
efficient Dense Global Fusion, meanwhile guaranteeing top performance for
camera-LiDAR multi-modal 3D object detection. Our motivation stems from the
observation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability
to simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining
complete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models
(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range
modeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial
since our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity
methods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade
performance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information
during multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To
resolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise
height information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby
enhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba
Block, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local
and global contextual learning. By integrating these components, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with the top-tire NDS score of 75.0 on
the nuScenes validation benchmark, even surpassing methods that utilize
high-resolution inputs. Meanwhile, our method maintains efficiency, achieving
faster inference speed than most recent state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架首次利用大视觉语言模型形式化墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Result: 实验表明，除部分不相关域外，可解释性成功迁移，解释质量提升且分类准确性未下降。ImageNet上学习的可解释性向量具有普适性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，单次推理的解释质量接近需150次推理的Kernel SHAP。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Result: 实验结果表明，CoIBA显著提升了特征归因的忠实性。

Conclusion: CoIBA通过综合多目标层信息，弥补了现有方法的不足，提供了更全面的决策解释。

Abstract: The feature attribution method reveals the contribution of input variables to
the decision-making process to provide an attribution map for explanation.
Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute
information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the
features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the
attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the
decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant
information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our
core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to
estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio
across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed
information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the
relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational
approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper
bounding layer-wise information. Therefore, CoIBA guarantees that the discarded
activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision. The
extensive experimental results demonstrate the enhancement in faithfulness of
the feature attributions provided by CoIBA.

Conclusion: RegistrationMamba通过SSMs和多专家学习策略，显著提升了CRSI注册的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for
multi-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:
significant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and
limited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing
methods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer
architectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,
CNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,
and Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their
application to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes
RegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models
(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of
CRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional
cross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear
complexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under
texture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)
strategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through
multiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically
fuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature
representations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be
seamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting
registration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a
multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local
information and enable effective interaction between global and local features.
Extensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated
that RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sat2City为3D城市生成提供了高效解决方案，适用于游戏、数字孪生等领域。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have enabled 3D urban scene
generation from satellite imagery, unlocking promising applications in gaming,
digital twins, and beyond. However, most existing methods rely heavily on
neural rendering techniques, which hinder their ability to produce detailed 3D
structures on a broader scale, largely due to the inherent structural ambiguity
derived from relatively limited 2D observations. To address this challenge, we
propose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational
capacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored
specifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three
key components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively
recovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at
its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature
grids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy
enabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome
the challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality
geometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D
cities paired with satellite-view height maps. Validated on this dataset, our
framework generates detailed 3D structures from a single satellite image,
achieving superior fidelity compared to existing city generation models.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene
representation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,
depth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth
estimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but
also suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can
be erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this
paper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed
depth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the
distribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and
high-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D
pixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the
view-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the
training of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in
conjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective
regularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments
conducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than
state-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization
methods.

*Guandong Li,Mengxia Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVNet结合3D-CNN、Transformer和Mamba的优势，提出了一种高效的高光谱图像分类网络，解决了高维数据、样本不足和光谱冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维数据、训练样本有限和光谱冗余等挑战，导致过拟合和泛化能力不足。

Method: MVNet采用双分支Mamba模块（SSM分支和非SSM分支）和优化的HSI-MambaVision Mixer模块，实现空间-光谱特征的高效提取与融合。

Result: 在IN、UP和KSC数据集上，MVNet在分类精度和计算效率上优于主流方法。

Conclusion: MVNet展示了处理复杂高光谱数据的强大能力，为高光谱图像分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces challenges such as
high-dimensional data, limited training samples, and spectral redundancy, which
often lead to overfitting and insufficient generalization capability. This
paper proposes a novel MVNet network architecture that integrates 3D-CNN's
local feature extraction, Transformer's global modeling, and Mamba's linear
complexity sequence modeling capabilities, achieving efficient spatial-spectral
feature extraction and fusion. MVNet features a redesigned dual-branch Mamba
module, including a State Space Model (SSM) branch and a non-SSM branch
employing 1D convolution with SiLU activation, enhancing modeling of both
short-range and long-range dependencies while reducing computational latency in
traditional Mamba. The optimized HSI-MambaVision Mixer module overcomes the
unidirectional limitation of causal convolution, capturing bidirectional
spatial-spectral dependencies in a single forward pass through decoupled
attention that focuses on high-value features, alleviating parameter redundancy
and the curse of dimensionality. On IN, UP, and KSC datasets, MVNet outperforms
mainstream hyperspectral image classification methods in both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating robust capability in
processing complex HSI data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个大规模光谱食品（SFOOD）基准套件，填补了食品智能分析领域的空白，并发现光谱数据对食品属性分析至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注食品类别，缺乏全面的大型食品基准，且许多食品属性（如甜度、重量等）难以仅通过RGB摄像头准确感知。

Method: 组织现有食品数据集并收集数百种食品的高光谱图像，使用仪器实验测定甜度、重量等属性，构建包含3,266个食品类别和2,351k数据点的基准。

Result: 大规模模型在数字化食品方面表现不佳，食品成为最难研究的对象之一；光谱数据对分析食品属性（如甜度）至关重要。

Conclusion: SFOOD基准将开源并持续迭代，推动食品智能分析的发展。

Abstract: With the rise and development of computer vision and LLMs, intelligence is
everywhere, especially for people and cars. However, for tremendous food
attributes (such as origin, quantity, weight, quality, sweetness, etc.),
existing research still mainly focuses on the study of categories. The reason
is the lack of a large and comprehensive benchmark for food. Besides, many food
attributes (such as sweetness, weight, and fine-grained categories) are
challenging to accurately percept solely through RGB cameras. To fulfill this
gap and promote the development of intelligent food analysis, in this paper, we
built the first large-scale spectral food (SFOOD) benchmark suite. We spent a
lot of manpower and equipment costs to organize existing food datasets and
collect hyperspectral images of hundreds of foods, and we used instruments to
experimentally determine food attributes such as sweetness and weight. The
resulting benchmark consists of 3,266 food categories and 2,351 k data points
for 17 main food categories. Extensive evaluations find that: (i) Large-scale
models are still poor at digitizing food. Compared to people and cars, food has
gradually become one of the most difficult objects to study; (ii) Spectrum data
are crucial for analyzing food properties (such as sweetness). Our benchmark
will be open source and continuously iterated for different food analysis
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在图像生成与动作预测结合中存在冗余信息和缺乏全面世界知识的问题，DreamVLA旨在通过动态区域引导的世界知识预测来解决这些问题。

Method: DreamVLA采用动态区域引导的世界知识预测，结合空间和语义线索，并使用块状结构化注意力机制防止信息泄漏。此外，采用基于扩散的Transformer解耦动作表示。

Result: 在真实和仿真环境中，DreamVLA在真实机器人任务中达到76.7%的成功率，在CALVIN ABC-D基准测试中平均长度为4.44。

Conclusion: DreamVLA通过整合全面的世界知识预测和结构化注意力机制，显著提升了机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise in
integrating image generation with action prediction to improve generalization
and reasoning in robot manipulation. However, existing methods are limited to
challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information
and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,
spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose
DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge
forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a
perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,
DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,
integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet
comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how
humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning
chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and
semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured
attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information
leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to
model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a
diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from
shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation
environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real
robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在复杂场景中难以实现输入文本与空间组合的对齐，布局规划与生成过程脱节。

Method: CoT-Diff框架在扩散过程中集成MLLM驱动的3D布局规划，通过动态更新布局并转换为语义条件和深度图，利用条件感知注意力机制指导生成。

Result: 在3D场景基准测试中，CoT-Diff在复杂场景空间准确性上比现有方法提升了34.7%。

Conclusion: CoT-Diff验证了这种紧密耦合生成范式的有效性，显著提升了空间对齐和语义控制。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models struggle to align spatial
composition with the input text, especially in complex scenes. Even
layout-based approaches yield suboptimal spatial control, as their generation
process is decoupled from layout planning, making it difficult to refine the
layout during synthesis. We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings
step-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the
diffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a
single diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate
predictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides
the generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic
conditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a
condition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and
semantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff
significantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial
accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation
paradigm.

Motivation: 边缘设备上的实时视频抠图网络存在计算限制，二值化方法虽常见但存在精度和效率问题。

Method: 提出弹性快捷连接和可进化拓扑的二值化计算结构，稀疏化解码器中间特征，并构建局部二值化感知模仿框架。

Result: BiVM在计算和存储成本上分别节省14.3倍和21.6倍，性能优于现有二值化方法。

Conclusion: BiVM通过信息瓶颈理论优化，显著提升了二值化视频抠图的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for real-time video matting suffer significant
computational limitations on edge devices, hindering their adoption in
widespread applications such as online conferences and short-form video
production. Binarization emerges as one of the most common compression
approaches with compact 1-bit parameters and efficient bitwise operations.
However, accuracy and efficiency limitations exist in the binarized video
matting network due to its degenerated encoder and redundant decoder. Following
a theoretical analysis based on the information bottleneck principle, the
limitations are mainly caused by the degradation of prediction-relevant
information in the intermediate features and the redundant computation in
prediction-irrelevant areas. We present BiVM, an accurate and
resource-efficient Binarized neural network for Video Matting. First, we
present a series of binarized computation structures with elastic shortcuts and
evolvable topologies, enabling the constructed encoder backbone to extract
high-quality representation from input videos for accurate prediction. Second,
we sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking
homogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse
details while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.
Furthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework
with the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation
in full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative
binarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)
binarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves
significant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,
respectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) models and the ever-increasing size
of available datasets have raised the interest of the research community in the
always important field of vision-based hand gesture recognition (VHGR), and
delivered a wide range of applications, such as sign language understanding and
human-computer interaction using cameras. Despite the large volume of research
works in the field, a structured and complete survey on VHGR is still missing,
leaving researchers to navigate through hundreds of papers in order to find the
right combination of data, model, and approach for each task. The current
survey aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of this
aspect of computer vision. With a systematic research methodology that
identifies the state-of-the-art works and a structured presentation of the
various methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, this review aims to
constitute a useful guideline for researchers, helping them to choose the right
strategy for delving into a certain VHGR task. Starting with the methodology
used for study selection, literature retrieval, and the analytical framing, the
survey identifies and organizes key VHGR approaches using a taxonomy-based
format in various dimensions such as input modality and application domain. The
core of the survey provides an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques
across three primary VHGR tasks: static gesture recognition, isolated dynamic
gestures and continuous gesture recognition. For each task, the architectural
trends and learning strategies are listed. Additionally, the study reviews
commonly used datasets - emphasizing on annotation schemes - and evaluates
standard performance metrics. It concludes by identifying major challenges in
VHGR, including both general computer vision issues and domain-specific
obstacles, and outlines promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法为风格个性化图像生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a training-free framework for style-personalized image generation
that controls content and style information during inference using a scale-wise
autoregressive model. Our method employs a three-path design--content, style,
and generation--each guided by a corresponding text prompt, enabling flexible
and efficient control over image semantics without any additional training. A
central contribution of this work is a step-wise and attention-wise
intervention analysis. Through systematic prompt and feature injection, we find
that early-to-middle generation steps play a pivotal role in shaping both
content and style, and that query features predominantly encode
content-specific information. Guided by these insights, we introduce two
targeted mechanisms: Key Stage Attention Sharing, which aligns content and
style during the semantically critical steps, and Adaptive Query Sharing, which
reinforces content semantics in later steps through similarity-aware query
blending. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive style fidelity and prompt fidelity compared to fine-tuned
baselines, while offering faster inference and greater deployment flexibility.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个定位任务中达到最先进性能，并在大规模自动驾驶车队测试中表现稳定。

Conclusion: U-ViLAR框架在城市环境中实现了高精度和鲁棒性的视觉定位。

Abstract: Accurate localization using visual information is a critical yet challenging
task, especially in urban environments where nearby buildings and construction
sites significantly degrade GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signal
quality. This issue underscores the importance of visual localization
techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes
U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to
address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using
high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first
extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we
introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors
caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided
Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By
effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of
association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of
registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has
undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has
demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过结合视觉语言模型和多模态数据，显著提升了多场景相机重定位的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

Motivation: 现有CLIP方法依赖外部数据或泛化能力有限，FA旨在通过ID知识提升OOD检测。

Method: 学习包含多样化ID类描述的强制提示，通过强制系数增强语义相似性。

Result: FA在OOD检测中显著优于现有方法，无需外部数据。

Conclusion: FA通过ID知识优化OOD检测，效果显著且高效。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection recently. However, existing CLIP-based methods often focus on
learning OOD-related knowledge to improve OOD detection, showing limited
generalization or reliance on external large-scale auxiliary datasets. In this
study, instead of delving into the intricate OOD-related knowledge, we propose
an innovative CLIP-based framework based on Forced prompt leArning (FA),
designed to make full use of the In-Distribution (ID) knowledge and ultimately
boost the effectiveness of OOD detection. Our key insight is to learn a prompt
(i.e., forced prompt) that contains more diversified and richer descriptions of
the ID classes beyond the textual semantics of class labels. Specifically, it
promotes better discernment for ID images, by forcing more notable semantic
similarity between ID images and the learnable forced prompt. Moreover, we
introduce a forced coefficient, encouraging the forced prompt to learn more
comprehensive and nuanced descriptions of the ID classes. In this way, FA is
capable of achieving notable improvements in OOD detection, even when trained
without any external auxiliary datasets, while maintaining an identical number
of trainable parameters as CoOp. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our
method consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is

Conclusion: 该研究为空间基础手势生成和具身多模态交互提供了新的研究基础和工具。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Motivation: 现实世界的数据收集偏向常见场景和对象，导致新颖案例代表性不足，影响模型泛化能力和安全性。

Method: 使用动态Mean Shift算法为图像帧分配数据驱动的新颖性分数，基于均值和协方差统计建模正常内容，识别并丢弃冗余帧。

Result: 减少训练数据集大小可提高模型性能，而数据冗余增加时更激进的过滤方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实时部署，能持续更新正常内容的定义，高效检测连续数据流中的新颖性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in
autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward
common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance
hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the
curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard
logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of
redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to
biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused
on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.
The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel
dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and
covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those
with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training
dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher
redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more
aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random
sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and
unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment
with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating
the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties
in a continuous data stream.

Abstract: Discrete video tokenization is essential for efficient autoregressive

introduces a state-of-the-art discrete video tokenizer with two key
contributions. First, we propose a novel Mamba-based encoder-decoder

quantization, which significantly enhances the representational power of
quantized latents while preserving the token count. Our model sets a new
state-of-the-art, outperforming both causal 3D convolutionbased and
Transformer-based approaches across multiple datasets. Experimental results
further demonstrate its robustness as a tokenizer for autoregressive video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在需要细粒度控制的编辑任务（如人脸编辑）中表现不佳，容易丢失身份信息或修改无关区域。

Method: 通过微调模型将身份信息嵌入可学习的文本标记，并使用正交约束和对象掩码实现语义解耦和空间聚焦。

Result: 实验表明，S$^2$Edit在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，并能应用于多种图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: S$^2$Edit在保持身份信息的同时实现了精确的局部编辑，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality generation and
manipulation of images guided by texts, as well as concept learning from
images. However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that
require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal
solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the
editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts.
In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise
semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the
identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we
disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by
enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure
that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks
to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs
localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with
semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally,
we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such
as makeup transfer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CVFusion的跨视图两阶段融合网络，用于提升4D雷达在自动驾驶中的3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣天气下具有鲁棒性，但其稀疏点和噪声测量限制了性能提升，现有研究多依赖相机图像融合，潜力未充分挖掘。

Method: 设计了两阶段融合网络：第一阶段通过雷达引导的迭代BEV融合模块生成高召回率的3D提案框；第二阶段聚合多视图特征（点、图像、BEV）以优化提案。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优异，View-of-Delft和TJ4DRadSet的mAP分别提升了9.10%和3.68%。

Conclusion: CVFusion通过跨视图融合显著提升了4D雷达的3D物体检测性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: 4D radar has received significant attention in autonomous driving thanks to
its robustness under adverse weathers. Due to the sparse points and noisy
measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object
detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in
BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is
still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study,
we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first
stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to
generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate
features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for
each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine
the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on
public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on
View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively. Our code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态嵌入模型主要针对自然图像，对其他视觉形式（如视频和视觉文档）支持有限，限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出VLM2Vec-V2框架，并扩展MMEB-V2基准，新增五种任务类型，训练通用嵌入模型。

Result: VLM2Vec-V2在新任务和原有任务上均表现优异，验证了其通用性和性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态嵌入模型的通用性和统一学习策略提供了见解，为研究和实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种基于QR分解的新型微调框架，用于在文本到图像模型中分离内容和风格属性，减少参数数量并避免特征纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如LoRA）在结合多个模型时会导致内容和风格属性的特征纠缠，影响生成效果。

Method: 利用QR分解，固定Q和R矩阵，仅训练额外的ΔR矩阵，实现结构化参数更新。

Result: QR-LoRA在内容和风格融合任务中表现出更好的解耦效果，参数数量仅为传统LoRA的一半。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA为生成模型提供了一种参数高效且解耦的微调新范式。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image models often rely on parameter fine-tuning techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to customize visual attributes. However,
when combining multiple LoRA models for content-style fusion tasks,
unstructured modifications of weight matrices often lead to undesired feature
entanglement between content and style attributes. We propose QR-LoRA, a novel
fine-tuning framework leveraging QR decomposition for structured parameter
updates that effectively separate visual attributes. Our key insight is that
the orthogonal Q matrix naturally minimizes interference between different
visual features, while the upper triangular R matrix efficiently encodes
attribute-specific transformations. Our approach fixes both Q and R matrices
while only training an additional task-specific $\Delta R$ matrix. This
structured design reduces trainable parameters to half of conventional LoRA
methods and supports effective merging of multiple adaptations without
cross-contamination due to the strong disentanglement properties between
$\Delta R$ matrices. Experiments demonstrate that QR-LoRA achieves superior
disentanglement in content-style fusion tasks, establishing a new paradigm for
parameter-efficient, disentangled fine-tuning in generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HiLa的分层视觉语言协作框架，用于改进癌症生存预测，通过多级视觉特征和语言提示的优化对齐，结合跨层次传播和互对比学习模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏的幻灯片级标签，难以从千兆像素WSI中学习判别性表示，且现有视觉语言模型在生存预测中未充分探索，存在语言提示简单和层次交互不足的问题。

Method: HiLa框架利用预训练特征提取器生成多级视觉特征，通过最优提示学习（OPL）对齐语言提示，并引入跨层次传播（CLP）和互对比学习（MCL）模块优化层次协作。

Result: 在三个TCGA数据集上的实验表明，HiLa实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉语言协作和优化提示学习，显著提升了生存预测的准确性，为WSI分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Result: 实验表明模型性能提升，训练成本显著降低，达到较高准确率时成本减半。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了3D视觉问答中的误导性标注问题，提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA) is crucial for enabling models to
perceive the physical world and perform spatial reasoning. In 3D VQA, the
free-form nature of answers often leads to improper annotations that can
confuse or mislead models when training on the entire dataset. While other text
generation tasks can mitigate this issue by learning on large-scale datasets,
the scarcity of 3D scene data enlarges the negative effect of misleading
annotations. Although active learning strategies can select valuable instances
for training, they fail to identify and resolve misleading labels, which the
oracle inevitably provides in practice. To address this issue, we propose a
multi-turn interactive active learning strategy. This strategy selects data
based on models' semantic uncertainty to form a solid knowledge foundation more
effectively and actively requests reannotation from an oracle to resolve
potentially misleading labels. For uncertainty assessment, we utilize a
variance-based metric that takes semantic relationships between terms into
consideration, thus avoiding the uniform inter-class similarity assumption of
previous assessment metrics. Extensive experiments exhibit better model
performance and a substantial reduction in training costs, with a halving of
training costs for achieving relatively high accuracy. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中实现了最优的跨域和联合泛化性能，无需特定数据集适配。

Conclusion: SMoEStereo通过动态模块融合和轻量级决策，显著提升了立体匹配的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Motivation: 现有研究常忽略局部时间依赖性和高阶运动状态属性，影响轨迹预测的准确性。

Method: 提出LTMSformer框架，包括局部趋势感知注意力机制、运动状态编码器和轻量级提案细化模块。

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%，模型大小减少68%。

Conclusion: LTMSformer在减少模型复杂度的同时，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

Result: 在21个基准数据集上的实验验证了MODA在感知、认知和情感任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MODA通过改进的注意力机制显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in
integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable
attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on
language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through
attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained
cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention
deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent
cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To
address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex
Attention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and
inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to
effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the
alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis
vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.
Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked
attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable
masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,
and emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in

Conclusion: UGG-ReID通过不确定性引导的方法有效提升了多模态对象重识别的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) has gained considerable attention
with the goal of retrieving specific targets across cameras using heterogeneous
visual data sources. Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification
performance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,
such as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is
particularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame
loss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above
challenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model
for multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise
interference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both
local and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their
dependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph
representation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local
cues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the
expressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated
embeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an
uncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples
to experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses
noise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design
an uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,
improving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five
representative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral
modalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
excellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current
methods in terms of noise immunity. Our code will be made public upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Automatically extracting vectorized building contours from remote sensing
imagery is crucial for urban planning, population estimation, and disaster
assessment. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on complex multi-stage
pipelines involving pixel segmentation, vectorization, and polygon refinement,
which limits their scalability and real-world applicability. Inspired by the
remarkable reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce
VectorLLM, the first Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) designed for
regular building contour extraction from remote sensing images. Unlike existing
approaches, VectorLLM performs corner-point by corner-point regression of
building contours directly, mimicking human annotators' labeling process. Our
architecture consists of a vision foundation backbone, an MLP connector, and an
LLM, enhanced with learnable position embeddings to improve spatial
understanding capability. Through comprehensive exploration of training
strategies including pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference
optimization across WHU, WHU-Mix, and CrowdAI datasets, VectorLLM significantly
outperformed the previous SOTA methods by 5.6 AP, 7.1 AP, 13.6 AP, respectively
in the three datasets. Remarkably, VectorLLM exhibits strong zero-shot
performance on unseen objects including aircraft, water bodies, and oil tanks,
highlighting its potential for unified modeling of diverse remote sensing
object contour extraction tasks. Overall, this work establishes a new paradigm
for vector extraction in remote sensing, leveraging the topological reasoning
capabilities of LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and exceptional
generalization. All the codes and weights will be published for promoting
community development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AVL研究局限于图像级关联，忽略了时间动态性，且假设场景过于简化（如单一可见声源）。AVATAR旨在填补这一空白，提供更全面的评估场景。

Method: 提出AVATAR基准，包含四种场景（单声源、混合声源、多实体、屏幕外），并开发TAVLO模型，通过高分辨率时间建模整合时间信息。

Result: 传统方法因依赖全局音频特征和帧级映射而难以跟踪时间变化，TAVLO则通过时间建模实现了更鲁棒的音频-视觉对齐。

Conclusion: 研究证明了时间动态性在AVL中的重要性，AVATAR和TAVLO为视频中心AVL设立了新标准。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Localization (AVL) aims to identify sound-emitting sources
within a visual scene. However, existing studies focus on image-level
audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative methods, especially diffusion models, have
made great progress in remote sensing image synthesis. Despite these
advancements, existing methods have not explored the simulation of future
scenarios based on given scenario images. This simulation capability has wide
applications for urban planning, land managementChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal
Image Generation with Multimodal Controls, and beyond. In this work, we propose
ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal diffusion model. Given pre-event
images and conditioned on multimodal spatial controls (e.g., text prompts,
instance layouts, and semantic maps), ChangeBridge can synthesize post-event
images. The core idea behind ChangeBridge is to modeling the noise-to-image
diffusion model, as a pre-to-post diffusion bridge. Conditioned on multimodal
controls, ChangeBridge leverages a stochastic Brownian-bridge diffusion,
directly modeling the spatiotemporal evolution between pre-event and post-event
states. To the best of our knowledge, ChangeBridge is the first spatiotemporal
generative model with multimodal controls for remote sensing. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChangeBridge can simulate high-fidelity future
scenarios aligned with given conditions, including event and event-driven
background variations. Code will be available.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Accurate histopathological
grading of CRC is essential for prognosis and treatment planning but remains a
subjective process prone to observer variability and limited by global
shortages of trained pathologists. To promote automated and standardized
solutions, we organized the ICIP Grand Challenge on Colorectal Cancer Tumor
Grading and Segmentation using the publicly available METU CCTGS dataset. The
dataset comprises 103 whole-slide images with expert pixel-level annotations
for five tissue classes. Participants submitted segmentation masks via Codalab,
evaluated using metrics such as macro F-score and mIoU. Among 39 participating
teams, six outperformed the Swin Transformer baseline (62.92 F-score). This
paper presents an overview of the challenge, dataset, and the top-performing

Abstract: Digital orthodontics represents a prominent and critical application of
computer vision technology in the medical field. So far, the labor-intensive
process of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D
orthodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth
arrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation
methods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and
are insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each
comprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a
novel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-
and post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth
arrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:
(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn
the distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the
generation of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style
generation module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models
by incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns
closely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth
alignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构引导和细节恢复，实现了高质量的肖像阴影去除。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based portrait shadow removal approach that can
robustly produce high-fidelity results. Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow
removal as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a
shadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait
dataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a
shadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the
unwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to
train a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a
generative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,
moles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the
gradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration
diffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing
methods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial
identity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and
loss of details. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在组合推理上表现不佳，主要因缺乏高质量的图像-文本数据。

Method: 利用大语言模型识别实体及其空间关系，独立生成图像块并按组合规则排列，同时引入专用损失函数区分样本。

Result: 实验表明，使用反事实数据微调模型显著提升了视觉推理性能，并在多个基准测试中达到最优。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少训练数据需求的同时，实现了高性能的组合推理。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with compositional reasoning due
to insufficient high-quality image-text data. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel block-based diffusion approach that automatically generates
counterfactual datasets without manual annotation. Our method utilizes large
language models to identify entities and their spatial relationships. It then
independently generates image blocks as "puzzle pieces" coherently arranged
according to specified compositional rules. This process creates diverse,
high-fidelity counterfactual image-text pairs with precisely controlled
variations. In addition, we introduce a specialized loss function that
differentiates inter-set from intra-set samples, enhancing training efficiency
and reducing the need for negative samples. Experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs with our counterfactual datasets significantly improves visual
reasoning performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple benchmarks while using substantially less training data than existing
methods.

TL;DR: Tempo-R0是一种视频多模态大语言模型，通过多模态时间感知强化解决时间视频定位任务，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频信息量大且冗余，模型需全面理解视频以准确检索查询相关片段。

Method: 采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳模态对齐（ETA）预处理，并在微调阶段应用部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）。

Result: 在QVHighlights测试集上比现有方法提升约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化有效提升了时间视频定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Result: 实验验证了方法在身份保留、文本相关性和视频质量上的优异表现，并在2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge中获得亚军。

Conclusion: 通过简单而有效的解耦机制，实现了高质量的文本到视频生成。

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create
high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for
downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a
critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts
of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises
instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism
risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework
that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal
features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic
prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The
former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components.
Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts
guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features,
while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to
ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach
achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding
performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By
leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the
runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

TL;DR: GeoSapiens是一种基于少样本学习的新框架，用于在有限标注的CBCT数据上实现稳健的牙科标志点检测，显著提高了检测成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙科标志点的准确检测对临床治疗至关重要，但传统手动标注耗时且存在主观差异，而深度学习因数据稀缺和标注成本高难以广泛应用。

Method: GeoSapiens结合了Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，优化了对解剖结构几何关系的捕捉能力。

Result: 在严格0.5毫米阈值下，GeoSapiens的检测成功率比现有方法高8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens为牙科标志点检测提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案，尤其适用于数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Method: 采用预分配固定ETF原型，设计一致性ETF对齐损失和语义一致性匹配器（SCM），统一监督和无监督学习目标。

Result: 在多个GCD基准测试中表现优异，显著提升新类别分类准确率。

Conclusion: NC-GCD框架通过几何结构优化和一致性目标，有效解决了GCD任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) focuses on classifying known categories
while simultaneously discovering novel categories from unlabeled data. However,
previous GCD methods face challenges due to inconsistent optimization
objectives and category confusion. This leads to feature overlap and ultimately
hinders performance on novel categories. To address these issues, we propose
the Neural Collapse-inspired Generalized Category Discovery (NC-GCD) framework.
By pre-assigning and fixing Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) prototypes, our
method ensures an optimal geometric structure and a consistent optimization
objective for both known and novel categories. We introduce a Consistent ETF
Alignment Loss that unifies supervised and unsupervised ETF alignment and
enhances category separability. Additionally, a Semantic Consistency Matcher
(SCM) is designed to maintain stable and consistent label assignments across
clustering iterations. Our method achieves strong performance on multiple GCD
benchmarks, significantly enhancing novel category accuracy and demonstrating
its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对ControlNets的新型数据投毒攻击方法，能够在无文本触发的情况下生成特定内容，揭示了开源ControlNets管道的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开数据集和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，本文旨在揭示这一漏洞。

Method: 通过注入毒化样本（将轻微触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时可靠生成NSFW输出，同时保持正常提示的保真度。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，攻击成功率高且原始输入中不可察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ControlNets的严重漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: 可解释的神经分析方法在生成复杂视频描述方面表现出色，并为端到端学习提供了有效指导。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval is essential for applications like
information retrieval and recommendation systems, particularly in specialized
domains such as manufacturing, where product information often consists of
visual samples paired with a textual description. This paper investigates the
use of Vision Language Models(VLMs) for zero-shot text-to-image retrieval on
fabric samples. We address the lack of publicly available datasets by
introducing an automated annotation pipeline that uses Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate two types of textual descriptions: freeform
natural language and structured attribute-based descriptions. We produce these
descriptions to evaluate retrieval performance across three Vision-Language
Models: CLIP, LAION-CLIP, and Meta's Perception Encoder. Our experiments
demonstrate that structured, attribute-rich descriptions significantly enhance
retrieval accuracy, particularly for visually complex fabric classes, with the
Perception Encoder outperforming other models due to its robust feature
alignment capabilities. However, zero-shot retrieval remains challenging in
this fine-grained domain, underscoring the need for domain-adapted approaches.
Our findings highlight the importance of combining technical textual
descriptions with advanced VLMs to optimize cross-modal retrieval in industrial
applications.

Conclusion: SalBench是衡量LVLM与人类视觉注意力一致性的重要工具，揭示了LVLM的局限性。

Abstract: We present Saliency Benchmark (SalBench), a novel benchmark designed to
assess the capability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) in detecting
visually salient features that are readily apparent to humans, such as a large
circle amidst a grid of smaller ones. This benchmark focuses on low-level
features including color, intensity, and orientation, which are fundamental to
human visual processing. Our SalBench consists of images that highlight rare,
unusual, or unexpected elements within scenes, and naturally draw human
attention. It comprises three novel tasks for evaluating the perceptual
capabilities of LVLM: Odd-One-Out Detection, Referring Odd-One-Out, and Visual
Referring Odd-One-Out. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLM using SalBench and our findings reveal a surprising
limitation: LVLM struggle to identify seemingly obvious visual anomalies, with
even the advanced GPT-4o achieving only 47.6\% accuracy on such a simple task.
SalBench will be an important step in measuring the capabilities of LVLM that
align with the subtle definition of human attention.

Abstract: We present MatDecompSDF, a novel framework for recovering high-fidelity 3D
shapes and decomposing their physically-based material properties from
multi-view images. The core challenge of inverse rendering lies in the
ill-posed disentanglement of geometry, materials, and illumination from 2D
observations. Our method addresses this by jointly optimizing three neural
components: a neural Signed Distance Function (SDF) to represent complex
geometry, a spatially-varying neural field for predicting PBR material
parameters (albedo, roughness, metallic), and an MLP-based model for capturing
unknown environmental lighting. The key to our approach is a physically-based
differentiable rendering layer that connects these 3D properties to the input
images, allowing for end-to-end optimization. We introduce a set of carefully
designed physical priors and geometric regularizations, including a material
smoothness loss and an Eikonal loss, to effectively constrain the problem and
achieve robust decomposition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets (e.g., DTU) demonstrate that MatDecompSDF surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in geometric accuracy, material fidelity, and novel
view synthesis. Crucially, our method produces editable and relightable assets
that can be seamlessly integrated into standard graphics pipelines, validating
its practical utility for digital content creation.

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，结合语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督模块，实现多模态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著降低幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

### [337] [Taming the Tri-Space Tension: ARC-Guided Hallucination Modeling and Control for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04946)
*Jianjiang Yang,Ziyan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知启发的方法，将文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型中的幻觉现象解释为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并开发了TensionModulator（TM-ARC）控制器以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管T2I扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度方面取得了显著进展，但仍存在幻觉现象，即生成内容与提示语义不一致。作者认为这些失败反映了生成过程中更深层次的结构性错位。

Method: 作者提出了Hallucination Tri-Space理论，将幻觉归因于语义连贯性、结构对齐和知识基础三个关键轴上的张力失衡，并开发了TM-ARC控制器来动态调整对齐张力。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC显著减少了幻觉现象，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解T2I系统中的生成失败提供了一种统一且可解释的方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最小二乘图的多智能体3D LiDAR场景抗噪声框架，通过多智能体合作提升对抗性攻击下的目标跟踪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EdgeAI系统（如自动驾驶车辆）需要具备对抗性威胁的鲁棒性，而单智能体跟踪缺乏情境感知，因此需要多智能体合作以增强上下文理解和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用最小二乘图工具，通过差分坐标和锚点，在多智能体对抗性边界框上减少检测中心的位置误差，分两阶段进行目标跟踪以抑制对抗性威胁。

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上的实验表明，该方法在对抗性条件下比现有单智能体和多智能体跟踪框架性能提升高达23.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外防御机制即可作为对抗性威胁的鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了多智能体场景下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous
vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling
accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over
time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to
adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for
multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This
paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against
adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on
multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the
least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each
detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected
graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle
detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and
associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further
suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the
real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly
outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by
up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient
approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.

*Eunseop Yoon,Hee Suk Yoon,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'对齐可回答性'的框架，旨在提升视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）评估问题相关性的能力，并拒绝超出视频范围的问题。同时，提出了一个评估框架和数据集构建流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs虽然在视频理解方面取得进展，但无法有效拒绝与视频内容无关的问题，导致在实际应用中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了'对齐可回答性'框架，通过训练模型评估问题相关性并拒绝不相关问题；设计了评估指标和数据集构建流程。

Result: 实验表明，现有最佳Video-LLMs无法拒绝不相关问题，而新框架能显著提升模型在这方面的表现。

Conclusion: 通过'对齐可回答性'框架，Video-LLMs能够更准确地评估问题相关性并拒绝不相关问题，提升了实际应用中的实用性。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

TL;DR: GraphBrep提出了一种显式表示和学习紧凑拓扑的B-Rep生成模型，通过构建无向加权图表示表面拓扑，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将拓扑隐式嵌入几何特征中，导致冗余信息和高计算成本，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用无向加权图表示表面拓扑，并采用图扩散模型学习拓扑，基于表面特征确定原始表面之间的连接性。

Result: 在两个大规模无条件数据集和一个类别条件数据集上，训练和推理时间分别减少了31.3%和56.3%，同时保持高质量的CAD生成。

Conclusion: GraphBrep通过显式表示拓扑，有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了生成质量，为B-Rep生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Direct B-Rep generation is increasingly important in CAD workflows,
eliminating costly modeling sequence data and supporting complex features. A
key challenge is modeling joint distribution of the misaligned geometry and
topology. Existing methods tend to implicitly embed topology into the geometric
features of edges. Although this integration ensures feature alignment, it also
causes edge geometry to carry more redundant structural information compared to
the original B-Rep, leading to significantly higher computational cost. To
reduce redundancy, we propose GraphBrep, a B-Rep generation model that
explicitly represents and learns compact topology. Following the original
structure of B-Rep, we construct an undirected weighted graph to represent
surface topology. A graph diffusion model is employed to learn topology
conditioned on surface features, serving as the basis for determining
connectivity between primitive surfaces. The explicit representation ensures a
compact data structure, effectively reducing computational cost during both
training and inference. Experiments on two large-scale unconditional datasets
and one category-conditional dataset demonstrate the proposed method
significantly reduces training and inference times (up to 31.3% and 56.3% for
given datasets, respectively) while maintaining high-quality CAD generation
compared with SOTA.

Motivation: 当前法律框架缺乏系统标准和可靠方法评估AI艺术版权，需建立明确标准和技术解决方案。

Method: 通过法律案例分析确立艺术风格三要素，提出ArtBulb框架，结合风格描述的多模态聚类和MLLMs。

Result: ArtBulb在定量和定性评估中优于现有模型，AICD数据集为AI艺术版权提供基准。

Conclusion: ArtBulb填补法律与技术间的空白，提升社会对AI艺术版权问题的关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式通道剪枝框架（PCP），通过迭代剪枝少量通道来加速CNN，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常逐层一次性剪枝，可能导致较大的精度损失。PCP旨在通过渐进式剪枝减少整体精度下降。

Method: 采用三步流程（尝试-选择-剪枝）迭代剪枝，包括估计精度损失、贪婪策略选择剪枝层、实际剪枝。还扩展至迁移学习场景。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP框架简单有效，显著减少了剪枝过程中的精度损失，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集样本不平衡且隐私限制严格，阻碍了机器学习模型的开发。合成图像可提升数据可用性并保护隐私。

Method: 通过微调的稳定扩散模型（使用LoRA权重）生成合成图像，结合少量真实样本指导，增强分类器性能。

Result: ResNet分类器准确率从27.3%提升至78.4%，CLIP分类器从61.8%提升至76.8%。合成图像与真实图像高度相似。

Conclusion: 合成图像是生物医学研究中克服数据限制、提升模型泛化能力的有效工具，有助于医学诊断和研究。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有掩码点云建模方法过度关注掩码区域的细节重建，导致无法学习通用特征。

Method: 提出在线码本引导的师生框架，包括几何感知分区策略、在线k-means更新码本、以及学生模型对齐掩码特征分配。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种下游任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: PointGAC通过聚类中心对齐策略，显著提升了特征学习的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Most masked point cloud modeling (MPM) methods follow a regression paradigm
to reconstruct the coordinate or feature of masked regions. However, they tend
to over-constrain the model to learn the details of the masked region,
resulting in failure to capture generalized features. To address this
limitation, we propose \textbf{\textit{PointGAC}}, a novel clustering-based MPM
method that aims to align the feature distribution of masked regions.
Specially, it features an online codebook-guided teacher-student framework.
Firstly, it presents a geometry-aware partitioning strategy to extract initial
patches. Then, the teacher model updates a codebook via online k-means based on
features extracted from the complete patches. This procedure facilitates
codebook vectors to become cluster centers. Afterward, we assigns the unmasked
features to their corresponding cluster centers, and the student model aligns
the assignment for the reconstructed masked features. This strategy focuses on
identifying the cluster centers to which the masked features belong, enabling
the model to learn more generalized feature representations. Benefiting from a
proposed codebook maintenance mechanism, codebook vectors are actively updated,
which further increases the efficiency of semantic feature learning.
Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on various
downstream tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/LAB123-tech/PointGAC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档因时间退化严重，现有修复方法无法满足实际需求，需更高效的多模态修复方案。

Method: AutoHDR采用三阶段方法：OCR辅助损伤定位、视觉-语言上下文文本预测和块自回归外观修复。

Result: AutoHDR将严重受损文档的OCR精度从46.83%提升至84.05%，人机协作下可达94.25%。

Conclusion: AutoHDR在自动化历史文档修复中取得显著进展，为文化遗产保护做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and

Result: 在Pmi-GMA数据集上验证了模型在预测不良运动模式中的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过不确定性建模显著提升了自动化GMA的可靠性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，SeqGrowGraph实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SeqGrowGraph通过模拟人类绘图过程，有效解决了复杂车道拓扑建模问题，为自动驾驶提供了更准确的车道结构表示。

Abstract: Accurate lane topology is essential for autonomous driving, yet traditional
methods struggle to model the complex, non-linear structures-such as loops and
bidirectional lanes-prevalent in real-world road structure. We present
SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph
expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane
graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines
($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one
vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n
\times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric
matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph
is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively
predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering.
Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工变换或3D数据，RIPE通过最小化监督需求，扩展训练数据范围，提升关键点提取器的泛化能力。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现优异，简化数据准备的同时达到先进水平。

Conclusion: RIPE在关键点提取和描述领域取得显著进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce RIPE, an innovative reinforcement learning-based framework for
weakly-supervised training of a keypoint extractor that excels in both
detection and description tasks. In contrast to conventional training regimes
that depend heavily on artificial transformations, pre-generated models, or 3D
data, RIPE requires only a binary label indicating whether paired images
represent the same scene. This minimal supervision significantly expands the
pool of training data, enabling the creation of a highly generalized and robust
keypoint extractor.
  RIPE utilizes the encoder's intermediate layers for the description of the
keypoints with a hyper-column approach to integrate information from different
scales. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary loss to enhance the
discriminative capability of the learned descriptors.
  Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that RIPE
simplifies data preparation while achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art techniques, marking a significant advancement in robust
keypoint extraction and description. To support further research, we have made
our code publicly available at https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/RIPE.

Motivation: 现有度量方法在时间和空间复杂度上代价高昂，且难以确保嵌入数据保留原始数据的局部和全局结构。

Result: 在合成、生物和图像数据集上验证了CMET的优越性能，表现出高效、稳定和适应性强的特点。

Conclusion: CMET是一种可靠且高效的嵌入质量度量方法，适用于各种数据类型和规模。

Abstract: Due to rapid advancements in technology, datasets are available from various
domains. In order to carry out more relevant and appropriate analysis, it is
often necessary to project the dataset into a higher or lower dimensional space
based on requirement. Projecting the data in a higher-dimensional space helps
in unfolding intricate patterns, enhancing the performance of the underlying
models. On the other hand, dimensionality reduction is helpful in denoising
data while capturing maximal information, as well as reducing execution time
and memory.In this context, it is not always statistically evident whether the
transformed embedding retains the local and global structure of the original
data. Most of the existing metrics that are used for comparing the local and
global shape of the embedding against the original one are highly expensive in
terms of time and space complexity. In order to address this issue, the
objective of this study is to formulate a novel metric, called Clustering
guided METric (CMET), for quantifying embedding quality. It is effective to
serve the purpose of quantitative comparison between an embedding and the
original data. CMET consists of two scores, viz., CMET_L and CMET_G, that
measure the degree of local and global shape preservation capability,
respectively. The efficacy of CMET has been demonstrated on a wide variety of
datasets, including four synthetic, two biological, and two image datasets.
Results reflect the favorable performance of CMET against the state-of-the-art
methods. Capability to handle both small and large data, low algorithmic
complexity, better and stable performance across all kinds of data, and
different choices of hyper-parameters feature CMET as a reliable metric.

Motivation: 卫星数据的快速分析对遥感应用至关重要，但现代卫星数据量大，传输延迟高。现有ML模型体积大、功耗高，不适合卫星部署。

Method: 采用定制化的YOLOv8架构，针对FPGA优化，功耗低于10W，并在xView3-SAR数据集上训练和评估。

Result: FPGA模型性能仅比GPU模型低2%和3%，但体积小2-3个数量级。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了小型高性能ML模型在SAR分析中的应用，为自主、响应式的地球观测系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Rapid analysis of satellite data is vital for many remote sensing
applications, from disaster response to environmental monitoring, but is
becoming harder to achieve with the increasing volumes of data generated by
modern satellites. On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential
solution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data
volumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or
power-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security
that exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been
demonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite
deployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or
have only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not
sufficiently represent the real-world task. Here we address this issue by
developing and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel
detection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized
for FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We
train and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel
dataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our
FPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%
lower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to
three orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet
highly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for

Abstract: 3D spatial graphs play a crucial role in biological and clinical research by
modeling anatomical networks such as blood vessels,neurons, and airways.
However, generating 3D biological graphs while maintaining anatomical validity
remains challenging, a key limitation of existing diffusion-based methods. In
this work, we propose a novel 3D biological graph generation method that
adheres to structural and semantic plausibility conditions. We achieve this by
using a novel projection operator during sampling that stochastically fixes
inconsistencies. Further, we adopt a superior edge-deletion-based noising
procedure suitable for sparse biological graphs. Our method demonstrates
superior performance on two real-world datasets, human circle of Willis and
lung airways, compared to previous approaches. Importantly, we demonstrate that
the generated samples significantly enhance downstream graph labeling
performance. Furthermore, we show that our generative model is a reasonable
out-of-the-box link predictior.

TL;DR: 该研究通过两阶段范式（大规模语言冷启动微调+多模态强化学习）提升多模态大语言模型的视觉推理能力，揭示了三项关键发现，并开发了性能领先的Open-Vision-Reasoner模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），以解锁高级视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段范式：1）大规模语言冷启动微调；2）多模态强化学习（RL），共近1000步训练。

Result: 模型Open-Vision-Reasoner在多个推理基准测试中表现优异（如MATH500 95.3%、MathVision 51.8%、MathVerse 54.6%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更强大、行为对齐的多模态推理模型提供了关键见解和资源。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made

Conclusion: HV-MMBench填补了现有基准的空白，为多模态大语言模型在人类中心视频理解中的评估提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Conclusion: 自监督特征为航拍图像分割提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying regions affected by disasters is a vital step in effectively
managing and planning relief and rescue efforts. Unlike the traditional
approaches of manually assessing post-disaster damage, analyzing images of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an objective and reliable way to assess
the damage. In the past, segmentation techniques have been adopted to identify
post-flood damage in UAV aerial images. However, most of these supervised
learning approaches rely on manually annotated datasets. Indeed, annotating
images is a time-consuming and error-prone task that requires domain expertise.
This work focuses on leveraging self-supervised features to accurately identify
flooded regions in UAV aerial images. This work proposes two
encoder-decoder-based segmentation approaches, which integrate the visual
features learned from DINOv2 with the traditional encoder backbone. This study
investigates the generalization of self-supervised features for UAV aerial
images. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of features from the DINOv2
model, trained on non-aerial images, for segmenting aerial images, noting the
distinct perspectives between the two image types. Our results demonstrate that
DINOv2's self-supervised pretraining on natural images generates transferable,
general-purpose visual features that streamline the development of aerial
segmentation workflows. By leveraging these features as a foundation, we
significantly reduce reliance on labor-intensive manual annotation processes,
enabling high-accuracy segmentation with limited labeled aerial data.

Result: 模型在分布外区域性能显著下降，扩展训练域可部分改善泛化，但无法完全克服地理差异。

Conclusion: 通过数据对齐等方法可提升空间泛化能力，推动降尺度方法的全球适用性，减少高分辨率气候信息获取的不平等。

Abstract: Earth System Models (ESM) are our main tool for projecting the impacts of
climate change. However, running these models at sufficient resolution for
local-scale risk-assessments is not computationally feasible. Deep
learning-based super-resolution models offer a promising solution to downscale
ESM outputs to higher resolutions by learning from data. Yet, due to regional
variations in climatic processes, these models typically require retraining for
each geographical area-demanding high-resolution observational data, which is
unevenly available across the globe. This highlights the need to assess how
well these models generalize across geographic regions. To address this, we
introduce RainShift, a dataset and benchmark for evaluating downscaling under
geographic distribution shifts. We evaluate state-of-the-art downscaling
approaches including GANs and diffusion models in generalizing across data gaps
between the Global North and Global South. Our findings reveal substantial
performance drops in out-of-distribution regions, depending on model and
geographic area. While expanding the training domain generally improves
generalization, it is insufficient to overcome shifts between geographically
distinct regions. We show that addressing these shifts through, for example,
data alignment can improve spatial generalization. Our work advances the global
applicability of downscaling methods and represents a step toward reducing
inequities in access to high-resolution climate information.

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了虚假相关问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an
untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite
existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the
issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These
spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in
the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,
and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in
video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with
incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor
generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual
reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and
enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task
from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address
unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or
phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to
estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is
performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on
video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows
us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video
from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click通过对象级视觉特征和音频对齐，显著提升了视频到音频生成的精确性和交互性。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Result: 实验表明InterGSEdit在3DGS编辑中实现了最先进的性能，提供了一致且高保真的编辑效果。

Conclusion: InterGSEdit通过交互式设计和注意力融合，显著提升了3D编辑的质量和用户体验。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting based 3D editing has demonstrated impressive
performance in recent years. However, the multi-view editing often exhibits
significant local inconsistency, especially in areas of non-rigid deformation,
which lead to local artifacts, texture blurring, or semantic variations in
edited 3D scenes. We also found that the existing editing methods, which rely
entirely on text prompts make the editing process a "one-shot deal", making it
difficult for users to control the editing degree flexibly. In response to
these challenges, we present InterGSEdit, a novel framework for high-quality
3DGS editing via interactively selecting key views with users' preferences. We
propose a CLIP-based Semantic Consistency Selection (CSCS) strategy to
adaptively screen a group of semantically consistent reference views for each
user-selected key view. Then, the cross-attention maps derived from the
reference views are used in a weighted Gaussian Splatting unprojection to
construct the 3D Geometry-Consistent Attention Prior ($GAP^{3D}$). We project
$GAP^{3D}$ to obtain 3D-constrained attention, which are fused with 2D
cross-attention via Attention Fusion Network (AFN). AFN employs an adaptive
attention strategy that prioritizes 3D-constrained attention for geometric
consistency during early inference, and gradually prioritizes 2D
cross-attention maps in diffusion for fine-grained features during the later
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterGSEdit achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering consistent, high-fidelity 3DGS editing
with improved user experience.

Abstract: As a long-term complication of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (DR) progresses
slowly, potentially taking years to threaten vision. An accurate and robust
evaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.
Ordinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories
to achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,
there exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The
uneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed
pattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining
category boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification
process more complex and prone to inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel
autoregressive ordinal regression method called AOR-DR to address the above
challenges by leveraging the clinical knowledge of inherent ordinal information
in DR grading dataset settings. Specifically, we decompose the DR grading task
into a series of ordered steps by fusing the prediction of the previous steps
with extracted image features as conditions for the current prediction step.
Additionally, we exploit the diffusion process to facilitate conditional
probability modeling, enabling the direct use of continuous global image
features for autoregression without relearning contextual information from
patch-level features. This ensures the effectiveness of the autoregressive
process and leverages the capabilities of pre-trained large-scale foundation
models. Extensive experiments were conducted on four large-scale publicly
available color fundus datasets, demonstrating our model's effectiveness and
superior performance over six recent state-of-the-art ordinal regression
methods. The implementation code is available at

Conclusion: TLB-VFI在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为视频帧插值提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to predict the intermediate frame $I_n$
(we use n to denote time in videos to avoid notation overload with the timestep
$t$ in diffusion models) based on two consecutive neighboring frames $I_0$ and
$I_1$. Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and
video-based) in this task and achieve strong performance. However, image-based
diffusion models are unable to extract temporal information and are relatively
inefficient compared to non-diffusion methods. Video-based diffusion models can
extract temporal information, but they are too large in terms of training
scale, model size, and inference time. To mitigate the above issues, we propose
Temporal-Aware Latent Brownian Bridge Diffusion for Video Frame Interpolation
(TLB-VFI), an efficient video-based diffusion model. By extracting rich
temporal information from video inputs through our proposed 3D-wavelet gating
and temporal-aware autoencoder, our method achieves 20% improvement in FID on
the most challenging datasets over recent SOTA of image-based diffusion models.
Meanwhile, due to the existence of rich temporal information, our method
achieves strong performance while having 3times fewer parameters. Such a
parameter reduction results in 2.3x speed up. By incorporating optical flow
guidance, our method requires 9000x less training data and achieves over 20x
fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models. Codes and results are
available at our project page: https://zonglinl.github.io/tlbvfi_page.

Conclusion: OPAL高效且准确，结合主动学习可进一步减少人工标注。

Abstract: The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep
learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus
on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of
human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label
noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large
training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes
to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as
possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce
OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a
desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for
labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified
accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing
vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of
test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on
seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,
relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just
1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.
Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in
labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all
methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated
test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while
achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we
show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional
4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal ophthalmic imaging-based diagnosis integrates color fundus image
with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide a comprehensive view of
ocular pathologies. However, the uneven global distribution of healthcare
resources often results in real-world clinical scenarios encountering
incomplete multimodal data, which significantly compromises diagnostic
accuracy. Existing commonly used pipelines, such as modality imputation and
distillation methods, face notable limitations: 1)Imputation methods struggle
with accurately reconstructing key lesion features, since OCT lesions are
localized, while fundus images vary in style. 2)distillation methods rely
heavily on fully paired multimodal training data. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel multimodal alignment and fusion framework capable of
robustly handling missing modalities in the task of ophthalmic diagnostics. By
considering the distinctive feature characteristics of OCT and fundus images,
we emphasize the alignment of semantic features within the same category and
explicitly learn soft matching between modalities, allowing the missing
modality to utilize existing modality information, achieving robust cross-modal
feature alignment under the missing modality. Specifically, we leverage the
Optimal Transport for multi-scale modality feature alignment: class-wise
alignment through predicted class prototypes and feature-wise alignment via
cross-modal shared feature transport. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric
fusion strategy that effectively exploits the distinct characteristics of OCT
and fundus modalities. Extensive evaluations on three large ophthalmic
multimodal datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance under various
modality-incomplete scenarios, achieving Sota performance in both complete
modality and inter-modality incompleteness conditions. Code is available at

<details>

Motivation: CVS识别在腹腔镜胆囊切除术中至关重要，但现有方法依赖高成本的视觉标注，且多模态模型在多标签任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出CVS-AdaptNet，利用正负提示对齐图像和文本嵌入，增强多标签分类性能。

Result: 在Endoscapes-CVS201数据集上，CVS-AdaptNet达到57.6 mAP，比基线ResNet50提升6点。

Conclusion: 多模态框架结合文本提示显著提升CVS识别性能，展示了通用模型在专业手术任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Conclusion: MML-SurgAdapt是首个将SPML应用于整合多外科任务数据的方法，为外科计算机视觉中的多任务学习提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object
grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning
and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can
significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass
estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This
paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth
images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of
point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome
the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using
ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This
synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense
depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired
with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks
across all evaluated metrics. The data generation
(https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training
of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and
the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在生成响应时可能出现与视觉内容不一致的幻觉现象，而人类认知中很少出现此问题。作者认为人类能够有效利用多模态交互信息，因此希望通过模仿人类认知行为来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出INTER算法，通过显式引导LVLM在生成响应时重新应用对多模态交互信息的理解，无需额外数据或训练。

Conclusion: INTER通过模仿人类的多模态信息处理方式，有效减少了LVLM的幻觉现象，且无需额外训练或数据。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Conclusion: MoDiT在音频驱动说话头生成中表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is critical for applications such as
virtual assistants, video games, and films, where natural lip movements are
essential. Despite progress in this field, challenges remain in producing both
consistent and realistic facial animations. Existing methods, often based on
GANs or UNet-based diffusion models, face three major limitations: (i) temporal
jittering caused by weak temporal constraints, resulting in frame
inconsistencies; (ii) identity drift due to insufficient 3D information
extraction, leading to poor preservation of facial identity; and (iii)
unnatural blinking behavior due to inadequate modeling of realistic blink
dynamics. To address these issues, we propose MoDiT, a novel framework that
combines the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a Diffusion-based Transformer. Our
contributions include: (i) A hierarchical denoising strategy with revised
temporal attention and biased self/cross-attention mechanisms, enabling the
model to refine lip synchronization and progressively enhance full-face
coherence, effectively mitigating temporal jittering. (ii) The integration of
3DMM coefficients to provide explicit spatial constraints, ensuring accurate
3D-informed optical flow prediction and improved lip synchronization using
Wav2Lip results, thereby preserving identity consistency. (iii) A refined
blinking strategy to model natural eye movements, with smoother and more
realistic blinking behaviors.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

Conclusion: 通过异步捕捉和生成模型，成功实现了低成本的高速4D重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing fast-dynamic scenes from multi-view videos is crucial for
high-speed motion analysis and realistic 4D reconstruction. However, the
majority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames
per second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS
input may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D
capturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and
processing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture
scheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of
cameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our
method achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring
specialized high-speed cameras. On processing side, we also propose a novel
generative model to fix artifacts caused by 4D sparse-view reconstruction, as
asynchrony reduces the number of viewpoints at each timestamp. Specifically, we
propose to train a video-diffusion-based artifact-fix model for sparse 4D
reconstruction, which refines missing details, maintains temporal consistency,
and improves overall reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances high-speed 4D reconstruction compared to
synchronous capture.

Abstract: Social networks can be a valuable source of information during crisis events.
In particular, users can post a stream of multimodal data that can be critical
for real-time humanitarian response. However, effectively extracting meaningful
information from this large and noisy data stream and effectively integrating
heterogeneous data remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we explore
vision language models (VLMs) and advanced fusion strategies to enhance the
classification of crisis data in three different tasks. We incorporate
LLaVA-generated text to improve text-image alignment. Additionally, we leverage
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based vision and text embeddings,
which, without task-specific fine-tuning, outperform traditional models. To
further refine multimodal fusion, we employ Guided Cross Attention (Guided CA)
and combine it with the Differential Attention mechanism to enhance feature
alignment by emphasizing critical information while filtering out irrelevant
content. Our results show that while Differential Attention improves
classification performance, Guided CA remains highly effective in aligning
multimodal features. Extensive experiments on the CrisisMMD benchmark data set
demonstrate that the combination of pretrained VLMs, enriched textual
descriptions, and adaptive fusion strategies consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy, contributing to more
reliable and interpretable models for three different tasks that are crucial
for disaster response. Our code is available at

Abstract: Generating intermediate video content of varying lengths based on given first
and last frames, along with text prompt information, offers significant
research and application potential. However, traditional frame interpolation
tasks primarily focus on scenarios with a small number of frames, no text
control, and minimal differences between the first and last frames. Recent
community developers have utilized large video models represented by Wan to
endow frame-to-frame capabilities. However, these models can only generate a
fixed number of frames and often fail to produce satisfactory results for
certain frame lengths, while this setting lacks a clear official definition and
a well-established benchmark. In this paper, we first propose a new practical
Semantic Frame Interpolation (SFI) task from the perspective of academic
definition, which covers the above two settings and supports inference at
multiple frame rates. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel SemFi model
building upon Wan2.1, which incorporates a Mixture-of-LoRA module to ensure the
generation of high-consistency content that aligns with control conditions
across various frame length limitations. Furthermore, we propose SFI-300K, the
first general-purpose dataset and benchmark specifically designed for SFI. To
support this, we collect and process data from the perspective of SFI,
carefully designing evaluation metrics and methods to assess the model's
performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing image and video, and
various aspects, including consistency and diversity. Through extensive
experiments on SFI-300K, we demonstrate that our method is particularly
well-suited to meet the requirements of the SFI task.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种基于物候学的分类框架，用于监测印度Telangana地区的水稻种植面积，显著提高了准确性，并揭示了农业景观的时空多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遥感方法难以应对碎片化农业景观的时空异质性，因此需要一种适应性更强的监测方法以支持粮食安全和农业政策。

Method: 采用物候驱动的分类框架，针对32个地区的农业生态差异进行本地化校准。

Result: 该方法整体准确率达93.3%，比传统方法提高8.0个百分点，并成功绘制了732,345公顷的水稻种植面积。

Conclusion: 研究证明，遥感框架应适应而非简化景观复杂性，为区域农业监测提供了科学且实用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate rice area monitoring is critical for food security and agricultural
policy in smallholder farming regions, yet conventional remote sensing
approaches struggle with the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristic of
fragmented agricultural landscapes. This study developed a phenology-driven
classification framework that systematically adapts to local agro-ecological
variations across 32 districts in Telangana, India during the 2018-19 Rabi rice
season. The research reveals significant spatiotemporal diversity, with
phenological timing varying by up to 50 days between districts and field sizes
ranging from 0.01 to 2.94 hectares. Our district-specific calibration approach
achieved 93.3% overall accuracy, an 8.0 percentage point improvement over
conventional regional clustering methods, with strong validation against
official government statistics (R^2 = 0.981) demonstrating excellent agreement
between remotely sensed and ground truth data. The framework successfully
mapped 732,345 hectares by adapting to agro-climatic variations, with Northern
districts requiring extended land preparation phases (up to 55 days) while
Southern districts showed compressed cultivation cycles. Field size analysis
revealed accuracy declining 6.8 percentage points from medium to tiny fields,
providing insights for operational monitoring in fragmented landscapes. These
findings demonstrate that remote sensing frameworks must embrace rather than
simplify landscape complexity, advancing region-specific agricultural
monitoring approaches that maintain scientific rigor while serving practical
policy and food security applications.

TL;DR: VDG-Uni3DSeg提出了一种新框架，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过多模态线索增强3D点云分割，显著提升了细粒度类别和实例的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云分割中稀疏结构、有限标注和复杂环境下细粒度类别区分困难的问题。

Method: 整合预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）和大型语言模型，利用LLM生成的文本描述和网络参考图像，设计语义-视觉对比损失和空间增强模块。

Result: 在语义、实例和全景分割任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg为3D理解提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CTA（跨任务对齐）的新方法，通过结合监督学习和自监督学习的表示对齐，提升测试时训练（TTT）的效果，无需专用模型架构即可增强模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但在面对分布变化（如领域或数据集变化）时性能显著下降。测试时训练（TTT）通过引入辅助无监督任务来提升模型鲁棒性，但现有方法需要专用架构。CTA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CTA利用多模态对比学习的成功经验，将监督编码器与自监督编码器的表示对齐，避免梯度干扰，保留自监督学习的鲁棒性，并在测试时实现更有语义意义的更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，CTA在多个基准数据集上显著提升了鲁棒性和泛化能力，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CTA通过跨任务对齐，无需专用架构即可有效提升TTT的效果，为模型在分布变化下的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低帧率无人机视频中，由于目标外观和位置的快速变化以及图像降质，多目标跟踪任务变得复杂且具有挑战性。

Method: 通过从单帧标注中学习实例关联，并利用场景的全局特征提供上下文信息，以提高跟踪的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法在减少输入图像分辨率和潜在表示尺寸的情况下，仍能保持较高的关联质量，且对干扰物和检测间隙具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在复杂场景下表现优异，并提供了一个军事车辆的标注基准数据集。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects
across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by
moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex
due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The
task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud
video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association
learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show
that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance
association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in
detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high
association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent
representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark
dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data
sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology
Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology
(IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督机器学习方法，通过双隐式神经表示框架分离信号中的背景和失真，无需标记数据或预定义字典。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先进实验和观测技术中数据信号被背景和失真干扰的问题。

Result: 在四维参数空间的大规模模拟和实验数据中成功分离物理信号与复杂背景。

Conclusion: 该方法为多领域信号分离问题提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

TL;DR: SegmentDreamer通过Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD)解决CD-based方法中的自一致性和跨一致性不平衡问题，提升文本到3D生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Consistency Distillation (CD)的方法因自一致性和跨一致性不平衡导致生成结果不理想。

Method: 提出SCTD，将PF-ODE轨迹分段并确保每段一致性，同时优化蒸馏流程。

Result: 实验表明SegmentDreamer在视觉质量上优于现有方法，支持高保真3D生成。

Conclusion: SegmentDreamer通过SCTD有效解决了CD-based方法的局限性，实现了高质量的文本到3D生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation improve the visual quality of
Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and its variants by directly connecting
Consistency Distillation (CD) to score distillation. However, due to the
imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based
methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to
sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present
SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of
consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we
reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory
Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly
defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD
partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE)
trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each
segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on
distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more
swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling
high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Method: 开发了一个框架收集大规模数据集REA，并提出了ST-LLM模型，通过投影器增强空间环境和时间观察的理解。

Result: 在REA数据集上，ST-LLM显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ST-LLM有效提升了MLLMs的时空理解能力，为智能体操作提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are
available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.

Conclusion: X-Planner通过自动化规划和数据生成，显著提升了复杂指令下的图像编辑效果和身份保持能力。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based image editing methods have significantly advanced
text-guided tasks but often struggle to interpret complex, indirect
instructions. Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity
preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address
these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing
model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to
systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear
sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates
precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and
ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits. Additionally, we propose a novel
automated pipeline for generating large-scale data to train X-Planner which
achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing benchmarks and our newly
introduced complex editing benchmark.

Conclusion: LiMA为自动驾驶提供了更有效的预训练范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

Conclusion: MoDA通过多模态融合和简化扩散过程，有效提升了说话头部生成的性能。

Abstract: Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a
crucial problem in the realm of digital humans and the virtual metaverse.
Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this
field with their strong generation and generalization capabilities. However,
several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference
and visual artifacts, which arise from the implicit latent space of Variational
Auto-Encoders (VAE), complicating the diffusion process; 2) authentic facial
expressions and head movements, resulting from insufficient multi-modal
information interaction. In this paper, MoDA handle these challenges by 1)
defines a joint parameter space to bridge motion generation and neural
rendering, and leverages flow matching to simplify the diffusion learning
process; 2) introduces a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the
interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, ultimately
enhancing overall facial expressiveness. Subsequently, a coarse-to-fine fusion
strategy is adopted to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring
effective integration across feature spaces. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoDA significantly improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency,
making it suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 3D PixBrush提供了一种无需用户干预的高效3D网格编辑方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present 3D PixBrush, a method for performing image-driven edits of local
regions on 3D meshes. 3D PixBrush predicts a localization mask and a
synthesized texture that faithfully portray the object in the reference image.
Our predicted localizations are both globally coherent and locally precise.
Globally - our method contextualizes the object in the reference image and
automatically positions it onto the input mesh. Locally - our method produces
masks that conform to the geometry of the reference image. Notably, our method
does not require any user input (in the form of scribbles or bounding boxes) to
achieve accurate localizations. Instead, our method predicts a localization
mask on the 3D mesh from scratch. To achieve this, we propose a modification to
the score distillation sampling technique which incorporates both the predicted
localization and the reference image, referred to as localization-modulated
image guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique on a
wide variety of meshes and images.

Conclusion: F-Hash为时间变化特征跟踪和演化可视化提供了一种高效且统一的编码解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive time-varying volume visualization is challenging due to its
complex spatiotemporal features and sheer size of the dataset. Recent works
transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous
Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression,
rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However,
training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling
large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash,
a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to
greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding
methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design
incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D
multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding
capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to
time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution
for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash
achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying
volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray
marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the
time-varying neural representation.

Result: 在ModelNet、ShapeNet等数据集上表现优异，在真实场景数据集ScanObjectNN和S3DIS上也具竞争力。

Conclusion: PointAMaLR在多尺度语义理解和实际应用中均表现出色。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a prominent research direction in
point cloud processing. While existing models predominantly concentrate on
reconstruction tasks at higher encoder layers, they often neglect the effective
utilization of low-level local features, which are typically employed solely
for activation computations rather than directly contributing to reconstruction
tasks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PointAMaLR, a novel
self-supervised learning framework that enhances feature representation and
processing accuracy through attention-guided multi-scale local reconstruction.
PointAMaLR implements hierarchical reconstruction across multiple local
regions, with lower layers focusing on fine-scale feature restoration while
upper layers address coarse-scale feature reconstruction, thereby enabling
complex inter-patch interactions. Furthermore, to augment feature
representation capabilities, we incorporate a Local Attention (LA) module in
the embedding layer to enhance semantic feature understanding. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmark datasets ModelNet and ShapeNet demonstrate
PointAMaLR's superior accuracy and quality in both classification and
reconstruction tasks. Moreover, when evaluated on the real-world dataset
ScanObjectNN and the 3D large scene segmentation dataset S3DIS, our model
achieves highly competitive performance metrics. These results not only
validate PointAMaLR's effectiveness in multi-scale semantic understanding but
also underscore its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) significantly transforms immersive digital interfaces,
greatly enhancing education, professional practices, and entertainment by
increasing user engagement and opening up new possibilities in various
industries. Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.
Nevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high

rendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices
such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual
behavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user
experience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,
a technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's
gaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated
rendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering
process.
  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the
computational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes
outweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To
address this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework
called~\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated
rendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering
processes. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a
state-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate
that A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\times$ while
maintaining visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型神经方法，实现高效稳定的动态头发模拟，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时头发模拟对虚拟角色真实感至关重要，但现有方法无法捕捉动态行为。

Method: 完全自监督的神经方法，无需人工干预或艺术家生成数据，结合紧凑高效的神经网络。

Result: 验证了方法在多种发型上的有效性，展示了实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 新方法突破了现有神经技术的局限，实现了动态头发模拟的高效与稳定。

Abstract: Real-time hair simulation is a vital component in creating believable virtual
avatars, as it provides a sense of immersion and authenticity. The dynamic
behavior of hair, such as bouncing or swaying in response to character
movements like jumping or walking, plays a significant role in enhancing the
overall realism and engagement of virtual experiences. Current methods for
simulating hair have been constrained by two primary approaches: highly
optimized physics-based systems and neural methods. However, state-of-the-art
neural techniques have been limited to quasi-static solutions, failing to
capture the dynamic behavior of hair. This paper introduces a novel neural
method that breaks through these limitations, achieving efficient and stable
dynamic hair simulation while outperforming existing approaches. We propose a
fully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual
intervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be
integrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end
methods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,
memory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing
for the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational
resources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: AutoLayout提出了一种双系统框架，通过慢速系统的详细推理和快速系统的坐标生成，结合自验证机制，有效解决了布局生成中的空间幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮或重叠，且难以平衡语义保真度和物理合理性。

Method: 采用双系统框架：慢速系统通过RRG管道提取对象属性和空间约束；快速系统生成坐标和拓扑关系，并通过自验证机制联合验证。引入LLM-based ARL库优化规则。

Result: 在8种场景中验证，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性上比SOTA方法提升10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢快协作推理和自验证机制，显著提升了布局生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IMMP的新方法，通过合并参数检查点来解决运动规划中的领域适应问题，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹数据集在目标领域应用时存在领域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本等问题。

Method: IMMP采用两步法：预合并捕获代理行为与交互，合并构建可适应模型。

Result: 在多个规划基准和模型上表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP有效解决了领域适应问题，提升了运动规划性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Result: 在零售环境中，机器人定位相对位姿误差为0.83米，物体映射位置误差为0.97米。

Conclusion: 系统高效、易部署，适用于商用机器人的视觉监控和物体映射。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Conclusion: StreamVLN通过慢-快设计实现了高效且鲁棒的多模态推理，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world
deployment. The project page is:

Motivation: 研究细胞形态、基因表达和空间组织如何共同影响组织功能是生物学中的核心挑战。现有方法通常孤立或低分辨率分析这些模态。

Conclusion: SPATIA为空间转录组学提供了统一的多尺度表示方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Motivation: 尽管机械取栓已成为大血管闭塞卒中的标准治疗，但仅50%的患者预后良好，因此需要更精准的预测工具。

Method: 使用449名患者的临床数据和影像数据（NCCT和CTA），结合新型基础模型，开发深度学习模型。

Result: 临床变量预测效果较好（AUC 0.719），加入CTA影像略有提升（AUC 0.737），但NCCT无额外贡献。个体化治疗效果预测能力有限。

Conclusion: 模型整合了影像和临床数据，预测性能达到先进水平，但个体化治疗效果估计仍需改进。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.

Result: 在多个真实低光数据集上表现优异，显著提升图像质量，抑制噪声并恢复细节。

Conclusion: EvRWKV在低光图像增强中达到先进水平，为实际应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Capturing high-quality visual content under low-light conditions remains a
challenging problem due to severe noise, motion blur, and underexposure, which
degrade the performance of downstream applications. Traditional frame-based
low-light enhancement methods often amplify noise or fail to preserve
structural details, especially in real-world scenarios. Event cameras, offering
high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution by asynchronously
capturing brightness changes, emerge as promising alternatives for low-light
imaging. However, existing event-image fusion methods suffer from simplistic
fusion strategies and inadequate handling of spatial-temporal misalignment and
noise. To address these challenges, we propose EvRWKV, a novel framework that
enables continuous cross-modal interaction through dual-domain processing. Our
approach incorporates a Cross-RWKV module, leveraging the Receptance Weighted
Key Value (RWKV) architecture for fine-grained temporal and cross-modal fusion,
and an Event Image Spectral Fusion Enhancer (EISFE) module, which jointly
performs adaptive frequency-domain noise suppression and spatial-domain
deformable convolution alignment. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on real-world low-light datasets(SDE, SDSD, RELED) demonstrate that
EvRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively enhancing image
quality by suppressing noise, restoring structural details, and improving
visual clarity in challenging low-light conditions.

Abstract: Small vibrations observed in video can unveil information beyond what is
visual, such as sound and material properties. It is possible to passively
record these vibrations when they are visually perceptible, or actively amplify
their visual contribution with a laser beam when they are not perceptible. In
this paper, we improve upon the active sensing approach by leveraging
event-based cameras, which are designed to efficiently capture fast motion. We
demonstrate our method experimentally by recovering audio from vibrations, even
for multiple simultaneous sources, and in the presence of environmental
distortions. Our approach matches the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality
at much faster speeds, approaching real-time processing.

Abstract: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) based methods have received extensive and
sufficient attention in the field of PolSAR image classification, which show
excellent performance. However, due to the ``black-box" nature of DL methods,
the interpretation of the high-dimensional features extracted and the
backtracking of the decision-making process based on the features are still
unresolved problems. In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt
to achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image
classification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition
(PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique
to the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the
polarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept
Bottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are
transformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable
polarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)
is used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise
and understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced
non-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR
datasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of
achieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the
analytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can
be obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the
interpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色图像常用于检测癌细胞区域，但CMOS图像缺乏诊断所需细节，而高光谱图像提供更全面的信息。然而，高光谱图像数据获取困难且存在噪声。

Method: 使用深度学习模型检测高光谱图像中的癌细胞细胞质，并提出数据增强方法，利用CMOS图像进行增强以解决数据不足和噪声问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的数据增强方法在定量和定性上均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强提高了高光谱图像中癌细胞细胞质的检测准确性。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images are commonly used to detect
nuclear or cancerous regions in cells from images captured by a microscope.
Identifying cancer cytoplasm is crucial for determining the type of cancer;
hence, obtaining accurate cancer cytoplasm regions in cell images is important.
While CMOS images often lack detailed information necessary for diagnosis,
hyperspectral images provide more comprehensive cell information. Using a deep
learning model, we propose a method for detecting cancer cell cytoplasm in
hyperspectral images. Deep learning models require large datasets for learning;
however, capturing a large number of hyperspectral images is difficult.
Additionally, hyperspectral images frequently contain instrumental noise,
depending on the characteristics of the imaging devices. We propose a data
augmentation method to account for instrumental noise. CMOS images were used
for data augmentation owing to their visual clarity, which facilitates manual
annotation compared to original hyperspectral images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: 提出的GAN框架有效解决了fUS数据稀缺问题，生成的图像具有高保真度和实用性。

Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) is a neuroimaging technique known for its high
spatiotemporal resolution, enabling non-invasive observation of brain activity
through neurovascular coupling. Despite its potential in clinical applications
such as neonatal monitoring and intraoperative guidance, the development of fUS
faces challenges related to data scarcity and limitations in generating
realistic fUS images. This paper explores the use of a generative adversarial
network (GAN) framework tailored for fUS image synthesis. The proposed method
incorporates architectural enhancements, including feature enhancement modules
and normalization techniques, aiming to improve the fidelity and physiological
plausibility of generated images. The study evaluates the performance of the
framework against existing generative models, demonstrating its capability to
produce high-quality fUS images under various experimental conditions.
Additionally, the synthesized images are assessed for their utility in
downstream tasks, showing improvements in classification accuracy when used for
data augmentation. Experimental results are based on publicly available fUS
datasets, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in addressing data
limitations.

Motivation: TRUS在前列腺癌诊断中因低对比度和各向异性分辨率存在局限性，需改进以准确识别临床显著性前列腺癌。

Method: 采用CNN-transformer混合架构，结合局部特征提取和全局依赖建模，通过HVA模块（包括视图内和跨视图注意力）及自适应融合模块动态整合特征。

Result: 在包含590名患者的内部数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的HVA网络显著提升了临床显著性前列腺癌的分类性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men,
and accurate identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) is critical
for timely intervention. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is widely used for
prostate biopsy; however, its low contrast and anisotropic spatial resolution
pose diagnostic challenges. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
hybrid-view attention (HVA) network for csPCa classification in 3D TRUS that
leverages complementary information from transverse and sagittal views. Our
approach integrates a CNN-transformer hybrid architecture, where convolutional
layers extract fine-grained local features and transformer-based HVA models
global dependencies. Specifically, the HVA comprises intra-view attention to
refine features within a single view and cross-view attention to incorporate
complementary information across views. Furthermore, a hybrid-view adaptive
fusion module dynamically aggregates features along both channel and spatial
dimensions, enhancing the overall representation. Experiments are conducted on
an in-house dataset containing 590 subjects who underwent prostate biopsy.
Comparative and ablation results prove the efficacy of our method. The code is
available at https://github.com/mock1ngbrd/HVAN.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为PhotIQA的数据集，用于开发和测试图像质量评估（IQA）方法，特别针对光声成像（PAI）中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏质量评分的医学图像，现有的IQA方法主要针对自然图像，不适用于医学图像，尤其是光声成像中的独特问题。

Method: 研究者构建了包含1134张光声图像的PhotIQA数据集，由专家对五种质量属性进行评分，并提供地面真实数据用于全参考评估。

Result: 实验表明，HaarPSI$_{med}$在相关性上显著优于SSIM（SRCC：0.83 vs. 0.62）。

Conclusion: PhotIQA数据集为光声成像中的IQA方法开发提供了重要资源，并展示了HaarPSI$_{med}$的优越性。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel
algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning
based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most
commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA)
have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application
inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not
surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In
photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for
assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a
multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be
solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to
both, acoustic and optical, artifacts.
  To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures
we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic
(PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties
(overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background
intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow
full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used,
providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$
significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC:
0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续学习框架，通过双重对齐策略（CNA和CRA模块）缓解医学图像分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中跨域数据获取导致的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法未能捕捉任务间复杂依赖关系。

Method: 采用双对齐策略：CNA模块对齐当前与历史网络的特征，CRA模块对齐历史缓冲数据与当前输入数据的特征。使用HSIC的线性和非线性形式设计特征映射与配对模块。

Result: 实验证明该框架在医学图像分割任务中有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: 提出的双重对齐策略显著提升了跨域持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning in medical image segmentation involves sequential data
acquisition across diverse domains (e.g., clinical sites), where task
interference between past and current domains often leads to catastrophic
forgetting. Existing continual learning methods fail to capture the complex
dependencies between tasks. We introduce a novel framework that mitigates
forgetting by establishing and enhancing complex dependencies between
historical data and the network in the present task. Our framework features a
dual-alignment strategy, the cross-network alignment (CNA) module aligns the
features extracted from the bottleneck layers of the current and previous
networks, respectively, while the cross-representation alignment (CRA) module
aligns the features learned by the current network from historical buffered
data and current input data, respectively. Implementing both types of alignment
is a non-trivial task. To address this, we further analyze the linear and
nonlinear forms of the well-established Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(HSIC) and deliberately design feature mapping and feature pairing blocks
within the CRA module. Experiments on medical image segmentation task
demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
under domain shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动脉夹层是一种严重疾病，需要紧急处理。通过分离真假腔，可以更好地辅助医生诊断并增强现有研究。

Method: 利用数学形态学操作和Aktouf等人的闭合算法，生成填充撕裂的3D表面，并以此切断腔体间的连接。

Result: 成功分离了主动脉夹层中的真假腔，首次实现了填充表面作为图像处理操作的应用，并提供了可视化的夹层图谱。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为诊断提供了可视化工具，还可能推动其他研究（如配准、分割和血流动力学）的发展。

Abstract: Aortic dissection is a serious pathology and requires an emergency
management. It is characterized by one or more tears of the intimal wall of the
normal blood duct of the aorta (true lumen); the blood under pressure then
creates a second blood lumen (false lumen) in the media tissue. The two lumens
are separated by an intimal wall, called flap. From the segmentation of
connected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection
3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us
to retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and
characterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces
are obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the
framework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the
intimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete
data, it is nevertheless possible to "materialize" them with these 3D filling
surfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these
holes.
  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections
between lumens in order to separate them.
  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image
processing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen
separation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic
dissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.
  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance
several current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于目标运动的新型傅里叶叠层成像方法，避免了传统方法中改变照明角度或相机位置的高成本与复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶叠层成像方法需要改变照明角度或相机位置，导致高昂的成本和复杂性，因此需要一种更简便的替代方案。

Method: 通过目标运动引入测量多样性，并结合基于学习的方法从双平面强度测量中估计k空间坐标，实现无需目标旋转信息的合成孔径成像。

Result: 在仿真和桌面光学系统中验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为傅里叶叠层成像提供了一种低成本、高灵活性的新途径。

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture
imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide
field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of
low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is
introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the
camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's
spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and
complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes
changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates
measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a
novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane
intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without
knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in
simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

TL;DR: PLUS是一个即插即用框架，用于增强非对比CT（NCCT）图像上肝脏局灶性病变（FLL）的分析，显著提高了恶性与良性病变的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D分割方法在区分肝脏恶性与良性病变时存在局限，且依赖专用成像技术，而NCCT更普遍。PLUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出PLUS框架，通过增强现有3D分割模型，优化NCCT图像上的FLL分析。

Result: 在8,651名患者的实验中，PLUS显著提升了病变级别和患者级别的F1分数。

Conclusion: PLUS有潜力通过广泛可用的NCCT成像显著改善恶性FLL筛查。

Abstract: Focal liver lesions (FLL) are common clinical findings during physical
examination. Early diagnosis and intervention of liver malignancies are crucial
to improving patient survival. Although the current 3D segmentation paradigm
can accurately detect lesions, it faces limitations in distinguishing between
malignant and benign liver lesions, primarily due to its inability to
differentiate subtle variations between different lesions. Furthermore,
existing methods predominantly rely on specialized imaging modalities such as
multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging, whereas
non-contrast CT (NCCT) is more prevalent in routine abdominal imaging. To
address these limitations, we propose PLUS, a plug-and-play framework that
enhances FLL analysis on NCCT images for arbitrary 3D segmentation models. In
extensive experiments involving 8,651 patients, PLUS demonstrated a significant
improvement with existing methods, improving the lesion-level F1 score by
5.66%, the malignant patient-level F1 score by 6.26%, and the benign
patient-level F1 score by 4.03%. Our results demonstrate the potential of PLUS
to improve malignant FLL screening using widely available NCCT imaging
substantially.

TL;DR: EdgeSRIE是一种轻量级混合深度学习框架，用于便携式超声成像中的实时斑点抑制和图像增强，具有低计算成本和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像中的斑点模式会掩盖解剖细节，导致诊断不确定性。现有深度学习方法计算成本高，难以在低资源设备上应用。

Method: EdgeSRIE包含两个分支：无监督去斑点分支和去模糊分支，网络量化后部署在低功耗SoC上。

Result: 在性能评估中，EdgeSRIE在CNR和AGM上优于基线方法，并实现实时推理（>60帧/秒）。

Conclusion: EdgeSRIE在资源有限环境下实现了实时高质量超声成像的可行性。

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details,
leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based
techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their
high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as
portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a
lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image
enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed
framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch,
which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a
deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware
implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and
deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption.
In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE
achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient
magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based
methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time
inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational
requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These
results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality
ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

Motivation: 血管分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有算法因血管的低对比度和复杂拓扑结构而表现不佳，导致分割不完整或拓扑错误。

Method: PASC Net包含两个关键模块：SSL模块通过优化卷积核设计增强对血管结构的适应性，HTC模块通过分层拓扑约束确保血管连通性。

Result: 在U-Net、FCN等架构中替换标准卷积为SSL卷积后，性能均有所提升；在nnUNet框架中，该方法在多个指标上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PASC Net通过创新的模块设计，显著提升了血管分割的准确性和拓扑完整性，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation is crucial to assist in clinical diagnosis by
medical experts. However,
  the intricate tree-like tubular structure of blood vessels poses significant
challenges for existing
  segmentation algorithms. Small vascular branches are often overlooked due to
their low contrast
  compared to surrounding tissues, leading to incomplete vessel segmentation.
Furthermore, the
  complex vascular topology prevents the model from accurately capturing and
reconstructing vascular
  structure, resulting in incorrect topology, such as breakpoints at the
bifurcation of the vascular tree.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vessel segmentation
framework called PASC Net. It includes two key modules: a plug-and-play shape
self-learning convolutional (SSL) module
  that optimizes convolution kernel design, and a hierarchical topological
constraint (HTC) module
  that ensures vascular connectivity through topological constraints.
Specifically, the SSL module
  enhances adaptability to vascular structures by optimizing conventional
convolutions into learnable
  strip convolutions, which improves the network's ability to perceive
fine-grained features of tubular
  anatomies. Furthermore, to better preserve the coherence and integrity of
vascular topology, the HTC
  module incorporates hierarchical topological constraints-spanning linear,
planar, and volumetric
  levels-which serve to regularize the network's representation of vascular
continuity and structural
  consistency. We replaced the standard convolutional layers in U-Net, FCN,
U-Mamba, and nnUNet
  with SSL convolutions, leading to consistent performance improvements across
all architectures.
  Furthermore, when integrated into the nnUNet framework, our method
outperformed other methods
  on multiple metrics, achieving state-of-the-art vascular segmentation
performance.

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，Grid-Reg表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Grid-Reg通过全局匹配和特征提取网络，有效解决了异构图像配准问题。

Abstract: Registering airborne SAR with spaceborne optical images is crucial for SAR
image interpretation and geo-localization. It is challenging for this
cross-platform heterogeneous image registration due to significant geometric
and radiation differences, which current methods fail to handle. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a novel grid-based multimodal registration
framework (Grid-Reg) across airborne and space-born platforms, including a new
domain-robust descriptor extraction network, Hybrid Siamese Correlation Metric
Learning Network (HSCMLNet) and a grid-based solver (Grid-solver) for
transformation parameters estimation. Our Grid-Reg is based on detector-free
and global matching loss rather than accurate keypoint correspondences. These
accurate correspondences are inherently difficult in heterogeneous images with
large geometric deformation. By Grid-Solver, our Grid-Reg estimates
transformation parameters by optimizing robust global matching loss-based patch
correspondences of whole images in a coarse-to-fine strategy. To robustly
calculate the similarity between patches, specifically that have noise and
change objects, we propose HSCMLNet, including a hybrid Siamese module to
extract high-level features of multimodal images and a correlation learning
module (CMLModule) based equiangular unit basis vectors (EUBVs). Moreover, we
propose a manifold loss EUBVsLoss to constrain the normalized correlation
between local embeddings of patches and EUBVs. Furthermore, we curate a new
challenging benchmark dataset of SAR-to-optical registration using real-world
UAV MiniSAR data and optical images from Google Earth. We extensively analyze
factors affecting registration accuracy and compare our method with
state-of-the-art techniques on this dataset, showing superior performance.

Abstract: COVID-19 is a severe and acute viral disease that can cause symptoms
consistent with pneumonia in which inflammation is caused in the alveolous
regions of the lungs leading to a build-up of fluid and breathing difficulties.
Thus, the diagnosis of COVID using CT scans has been effective in assisting
with RT-PCR diagnosis and severity classifications. In this paper, we proposed
a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on
GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including
Label Distribution Aware Loss(LDAM Loss) and Class-balanced(CB) Loss to solve
the long-tail problem existing in datasets. Our model reaches more than 0.983
MCC in the benchmark test dataset.

Result: 在EndoVis2018和EndoVis2017数据集上分别达到0.80和0.54的mIoU。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效帮助手术学员独立理解复杂手术场景，减轻专家负担。

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables
surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools,
and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm
intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide
detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This
challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to
trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones
inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a
solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.
However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,
rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an
hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel
prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.
Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the
EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust
and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces
the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently
and effectively understand complex surgical environments.

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for
patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated
during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training
sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive
language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for
surgical scenes. CLIP-RL presents a new segmentation approach which involves
reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement
of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has
shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions,
texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.
CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic
context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL
module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through
iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018

state-of-the-art models, and a mean IoU of 74.12% on EndoVis 2017. This
superior performance was achieved due to the combination of contrastive
learning with reinforcement learning and curriculum learning.

Motivation: 早期卵巢肿瘤检测对女性健康至关重要，但现有公共数据集不足，限制了深度神经网络的应用。

Method: 构建包含视觉、表格和语言模态的ViTaL数据集，提出基于THOAM的ViTaL-Net模型进行多模态特征融合和多病理分类。

Result: 模型在两种常见卵巢肿瘤类型上准确率超过90%，整体性能达85%。

Conclusion: ViTaL数据集和ViTaL-Net为卵巢肿瘤的多病理、多模态分类提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Ovarian tumor, as a common gynecological disease, can rapidly deteriorate
into serious health crises when undetected early, thus posing significant
threats to the health of women. Deep neural networks have the potential to
identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public
datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian
tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains
\textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496
patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three
subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from
2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations
of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients.
It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian
tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of
ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset
Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion
of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and
complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves
as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification
of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method
exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the
two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance
of 85\%. Our dataset and code are available at

### [422] [Dynamic Frequency Feature Fusion Network for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04510)
*Yikang Zhao,Feng Gao,Xuepeng Jin,Junyu Dong,Qian Du*

Motivation: 现有方法在建模频域特征时缺乏对不同地物类型的适应性，需要一种更灵活的方法来处理多源数据分类问题。

Method: 设计了动态滤波器块动态学习频域特征，并引入频域上下文知识；提出光谱-空间自适应融合块，通过通道洗牌操作增强跨模态特征融合。

Conclusion: DFFNet通过动态频域特征学习和跨模态融合，显著提升了多源遥感数据分类的性能。

Abstract: Multi-source data classification is a critical yet challenging task for
remote sensing image interpretation. Existing methods lack adaptability to
diverse land cover types when modeling frequency domain features. To this end,
we propose a Dynamic Frequency Feature Fusion Network (DFFNet) for
hyperspectral image (HSI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) / Light Detection
and Ranging (LiDAR) data joint classification. Specifically, we design a
dynamic filter block to dynamically learn the filter kernels in the frequency
domain by aggregating the input features. The frequency contextual knowledge is
injected into frequency filter kernels. Additionally, we propose
spectral-spatial adaptive fusion block for cross-modal feature fusion. It
enhances the spectral and spatial attention weight interactions via channel
shuffle operation, thereby providing comprehensive cross-modal feature fusion.
Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our DFFNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-source data classification. The codes will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/oucailab/DFFNet.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FB-Diff是一种基于傅里叶基的扩散模型，用于4D医学影像的时间插值任务，通过引入生理运动先验和频谱信息，模拟非线性呼吸运动，实现了更好的时间一致性和重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于线性运动假设，无法准确模拟非线性、准周期性的呼吸运动，因此需要从频率角度解决时间插值问题。

Method: 提出FB-Diff模型，结合生理运动先验和傅里叶基，通过扩散模型生成中间帧，利用变分自编码器提取频谱信息。

Result: FB-Diff在感知性能和时间一致性上达到SOTA，同时保持优异的重建指标。

Conclusion: FB-Diff通过频率视角和生成式方法，显著提升了4D医学影像时间插值的性能。

Abstract: The temporal interpolation task for 4D medical imaging, plays a crucial role
in clinical practice of respiratory motion modeling. Following the simplified
linear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models
to interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions
should be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by
this property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency
perspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed
FB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration,
physiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics
of temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately
devised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors
and case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational
Autoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions
with motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and
ending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases
via the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation
task in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal
consistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics. Codes are
available.

Abstract: The spectral response of a digital camera defines the mapping between scene
radiance and pixel intensity. Despite its critical importance, there is
currently no comprehensive model that considers the end-to-end interaction
between light input and pixel intensity output. This paper introduces a novel
technique to model the spectral response of an RGB digital camera, addressing
this gap. Such models are indispensable for applications requiring accurate
color and spectral data interpretation. The proposed model is tested across
diverse imaging scenarios by varying illumination conditions and is validated
against experimental data. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving
color fidelity and spectral accuracy, with significant implications for
applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and spectral imaging. This
approach offers a powerful tool for optimizing camera systems in scientific,
industrial, and creative domains where spectral precision is paramount.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DDU的高效深度展开框架，用于解决DSSI系统中的重建问题，通过分析解和网络初始化策略提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSSI系统的光学编码机制独特，现有重建算法不兼容，需开发新方法。

Method: 提出DDU框架，结合分析解和网络初始化策略，优化迭代重建过程。

Result: 实验验证DDU性能优越，参数和计算复杂度与现有SOTA模型相当。

Conclusion: DDU为DSSI中的展开方法提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems acquire spectral data cubes through
compressed sensing. Recently, diffractive snapshot spectral imaging (DSSI)
methods have attracted significant attention. While various optical designs and
improvements continue to emerge, research on reconstruction algorithms remains
limited. Although numerous networks and deep unfolding methods have been
applied on similar tasks, they are not fully compatible with DSSI systems
because of their distinct optical encoding mechanism. In this paper, we propose
an efficient deep unfolding framework for diffractive systems, termed
diffractive deep unfolding (DDU). Specifically, we derive an analytical
solution for the data fidelity term in DSSI, ensuring both the efficiency and
the effectiveness during the iterative reconstruction process. Given the
severely ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ a network-based
initialization strategy rather than non-learning-based methods or linear
layers, leading to enhanced stability and performance. Our framework
demonstrates strong compatibility with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,
which effectively address the initialization and prior subproblem. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of the proposed DDU framework, showcasing
improved performance while maintaining comparable parameter counts and
computational complexity. These results suggest that DDU provides a solid
foundation for future unfolding-based methods in DSSI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI诊断中的深度学习需要大量标注数据，但医学图像分割标注成本极高，尤其是病理图像中恶性肿瘤边界模糊，上下文信息重要。

Method: 在传统CP技术基础上增加膨胀操作（CP-Dilatation），以保留恶性肿瘤边界上下文信息。

Result: 在病理图像基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他先进基线方法。

Conclusion: CP-Dilatation能有效提升病理图像分割性能，尤其在保留边界信息方面表现突出。

Abstract: Medical AI diagnosis including histopathology segmentation has derived
benefits from the recent development of deep learning technology. However, deep
learning itself requires a large amount of training data and the medical image
segmentation masking, in particular, requires an extremely high cost due to the
shortage of medical specialists. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data
augmentation method built upon the conventional Copy and Paste (CP)
augmentation technique, called CP-Dilatation, and apply it to histopathology
image segmentation. To the well-known traditional CP technique, the proposed
method adds a dilation operation that can preserve the boundary context
information of the malignancy, which is important in histopathological image
diagnosis, as the boundary between the malignancy and its margin is mostly
unclear and a significant context exists in the margin. In our experiments
using histopathology benchmark datasets, the proposed method was found superior
to the other state-of-the-art baselines chosen for comparison.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SPIDER是一种新型监督框架，用于从双平面X射线图像重建CT体积，通过结合组织结构和隐式神经表示解码器，解决了稀疏输入和结构模糊的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双平面X射线成像在临床应用中存在3D体积重建的困难，现有方法常导致骨骼结构不完整和组织边界不精确，限制了其临床实用性。

Method: SPIDER通过联合监督将组织结构（如解剖分割）纳入隐式神经表示解码器，采用统一的编码器-解码器架构，直接嵌入解剖约束以增强结构连续性。

Result: 在临床头部CT数据集上的实验表明，SPIDER仅需两个投影即可生成解剖学上准确的重建，并在下游分割任务中表现出潜力。

Conclusion: SPIDER在个性化治疗规划和图像引导手术导航中具有显著临床价值。

Abstract: Biplanar X-ray imaging is widely used in health screening, postoperative
rehabilitation evaluation of orthopedic diseases, and injury surgery due to its
rapid acquisition, low radiation dose, and straightforward setup. However, 3D
volume reconstruction from only two orthogonal projections represents a
profoundly ill-posed inverse problem, owing to the intrinsic lack of depth
information and irreducible ambiguities in soft-tissue visualization. Some
existing methods can reconstruct skeletal structures and Computed Tomography
(CT) volumes, they often yield incomplete bone geometry, imprecise tissue
boundaries, and a lack of anatomical realism, thereby limiting their clinical
utility in scenarios such as surgical planning and postoperative assessment. In
this study, we introduce SPIDER, a novel supervised framework designed to
reconstruct CT volumes from biplanar X-ray images. SPIDER incorporates tissue
structure as prior (e.g., anatomical segmentation) into an implicit neural
representation decoder in the form of joint supervision through a unified
encoder-decoder architecture. This design enables the model to jointly learn
image intensities and anatomical structures in a pixel-aligned fashion. To
address the challenges posed by sparse input and structural ambiguity, SPIDER
directly embeds anatomical constraints into the reconstruction process, thereby
enhancing structural continuity and reducing soft-tissue artifacts. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on clinical head CT datasets and show that SPIDER
generates anatomically accurate reconstructions from only two projections.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong potential in downstream
segmentation tasks, underscoring its utility in personalized treatment planning
and image-guided surgical navigation.

Motivation: 解决医学影像数据集有限的问题，通过合成图像增强模型性能，并验证FID作为评估指标的实用性。

Method: 使用PGGAN生成合成图像，结合U-Net进行DME分割任务，分析FID与性能提升的关系。

Result: FID越低，合成数据对分割性能的提升越显著；合成数据比标准增强技术更有效。

Conclusion: 相似性高的数据集（低FID）能显著提升模型性能，但需注意图像需足够相似才能有效。

Abstract: Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging
datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A
common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this
study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement
which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative
Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular
Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with
limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with
standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments.
Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve
segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets
decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and
robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is
significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations
follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model
performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard
augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower
FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the
results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are
sufficiently dissimilar.

Abstract: Brain tumor resection is a complex procedure with significant implications
for patient survival and quality of life. Predictions of patient outcomes
provide clinicians and patients the opportunity to select the most suitable
onco-functional balance. In this study, global features derived from structural
magnetic resonance imaging in a clinical dataset of 49 pre- and post-surgery
patients identified potential biomarkers associated with survival outcomes. We
propose a framework that integrates Explainable AI (XAI) with
neuroimaging-based feature engineering for survival assessment, offering
guidance for surgical decision-making. In this study, we introduce a global
explanation optimizer that refines survival-related feature attribution in deep
learning models, enhancing interpretability and reliability. Our findings
suggest that survival is influenced by alterations in regions associated with
cognitive and sensory functions, indicating the importance of preserving areas
involved in decision-making and emotional regulation during surgery to improve
outcomes. The global explanation optimizer improves both fidelity and
comprehensibility of explanations compared to state-of-the-art XAI methods. It
effectively identifies survival-related variability, underscoring its relevance
in precision medicine for brain tumor treatment.

Motivation: 癌症生存预测需要整合病理全切片图像和基因组数据，但现有方法未能全面捕捉模态间和模态内的交互，导致预测性能受限。

Method: 提出多模态表示分解模块（MRD）和深度整体正交融合策略（DHOF），结合正则化训练优化表示。

Result: 在六个TCGA癌症队列上的实验表明，MurreNet达到了最先进的生存预测性能。

Conclusion: MurreNet通过解耦和优化多模态表示，显著提升了癌症生存分析的准确性。

Abstract: Cancer survival prediction requires integrating pathological Whole Slide
Images (WSIs) and genomic profiles, a challenging task due to the inherent
heterogeneity and the complexity of modeling both inter- and intra-modality
interactions. Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies
for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture
modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited
understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance.
To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation
Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis.
Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD)
module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and
modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between
modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined
then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes
constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of
modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated
into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF)
strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts
demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
survival prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）通常以千兆像素大小获取，计算上难以完全分析，且诊断标签通常仅在切片级别可用，精细标注成本高。

Method: SASHA结合轻量级分层注意力多实例学习（MIL）模型学习特征，并通过强化学习智能采样和放大高分辨率区域。

Result: SASHA在计算和内存成本显著降低的情况下，性能与全高分辨率分析方法相当，并优于稀疏采样方法。

Conclusion: SASHA为医学影像中自动化诊断提供了一种高效智能采样解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology.
Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering
it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution.
Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert
annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive.
Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small
fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full
resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based
{\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep
reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological
images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight
hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second,
SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction
(10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show
that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at
high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs.
In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods.
We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging
challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images
containing sparsely informative features.

Conclusion: 该方法对临床应用、医学教育和数据扩展有重要意义。

Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal
human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary
information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring
images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates
clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from
a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range,
resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer
to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for
stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over
viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for
clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension,
enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and
analysis. Our code is available at GitHub.

Abstract: The identification of cardiac phase is an essential step for analysis and
diagnosis of cardiac function. Automatic methods, especially data-driven
methods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an
unsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection
through self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from
4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for
manual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric
measurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable
spatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the
approach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2
frames (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised
methods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust
performance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for
ES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized
heart views due to fetal heart positioning variability. Our results demonstrate
the potential of the proposed latent motion trajectory strategy for cardiac
phase detection in adult and fetal echocardiography. This work advances
unsupervised cardiac motion analysis, offering a scalable solution for clinical
populations lacking annotated data. Code will be released at

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the
focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In
clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the
screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist
is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this
area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality
instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with
narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring
detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression
in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,
which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating
expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist
bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)
Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for
wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional
radiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level
instance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548
images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks
related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression
quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte
detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal
bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the
barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within
the RA-related domain.

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This
study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization
framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five

generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how
prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases
demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use
case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed
notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a
substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the
router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and
of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was
explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,
using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.
Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt
optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning
and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by
task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt
optimization research.

*Henri Aïdasso,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少样本学习（FSL）的新方法，用于检测持续集成中的间歇性任务失败，解决了现有方法因数据标签不准确导致的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间歇性任务失败是持续集成中的主要挑战，现有方法依赖启发式规则导致标签不准确，影响模型性能。

Method: 使用少样本学习（FSL）微调小型语言模型，生成丰富的嵌入向量，再训练机器学习分类器。

Result: FSL方法在仅需12个样本的情况下，F1分数达到70-88%，优于现有方法的34-52%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据质量的重要性，并提供了一种更高效的间歇性任务失败检测框架。

Abstract: One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous
integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job
failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky
tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such
as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large
datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or
regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on
non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job
failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not
an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In
fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1
open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job
failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using
few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model
using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich
embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based
approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,
outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4
projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over
quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the
detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.

Motivation: 定量成像在临床应用中展现出潜力，但需要客观评估以推动临床转化。

Method: 提出四种评估框架：虚拟成像试验、无金标准评估、联合检测与量化任务评估、多维参数输出评估。

Result: 这些框架为QI方法的评估提供了多样化工具，但各有局限性。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究QI评估方法，尤其是在PET等先进技术中的应用。

Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple
clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective
evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need,
multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on
previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation
studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials
(VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation
framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a
framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks
is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output
multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these
frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine
future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent
advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the
development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks
in the context of PET.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了联邦学习在多标签ICD代码分类中的可行性和性能，提出了一种轻量级且可扩展的流程，结合冻结文本嵌入和简单多层感知器（MLP）分类器。实验表明，嵌入质量对预测性能的影响远超分类器复杂性，联邦学习在理想条件下可接近集中式训练的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在为临床NLP应用提供一种隐私保护且易于部署的解决方案，特别适合分布式医疗环境。

Method: 采用冻结文本嵌入与简单MLP分类器结合的轻量级流程，测试了六种公开嵌入模型和三种MLP架构，并在集中式和联邦配置下进行实验。

Result: 嵌入质量对性能影响显著，联邦学习在理想条件下表现接近集中式训练，模型虽小但性能竞争性强。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了构建可扩展、隐私保护的医疗编码系统的可行性，并为未来联邦学习和领域自适应临床AI研究提供了方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning
(FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the
MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training
or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable
pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and
deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly
suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both
centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly
available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard
and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits
assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially
outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that
federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized
conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than
state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1
scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the
simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way
toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step
toward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了领域特定专业化对大型语言模型（LLM）检索能力的影响，发现数学专业化和长推理能力会降低检索效果，而视觉语言模型和代码专业化模型在零样本检索中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在领域特定专业化后对检索能力的影响，以推动统一检索器的发展。

Method: 使用八种Qwen2.5 7B LLM（包括基础、指令调优、代码/数学专业化、长推理和视觉语言模型），在零样本和监督设置下进行实验。

Result: 数学专业化和长推理能力导致检索性能下降，视觉语言和代码专业化模型在零样本检索中表现优异，甚至超越BM25。

Conclusion: 研究为跨领域和多模态融合的统一检索任务提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense
retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval
effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines
how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities,
an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling
text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments
with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned,
code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across
zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot
retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code
retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance,
all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical
specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation
in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and
semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs
demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even
surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance
to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising
directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and
cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Although the amount of available spoken content is steadily increasing,
extracting information and knowledge from speech recordings remains
challenging. Beyond enhancing traditional information retrieval methods such as
speech search and keyword spotting, novel approaches for navigating and
searching spoken content need to be explored and developed. In this paper, we
propose a novel navigational method for speech archives that leverages recent
advances in language and multimodal generative models. We demonstrate our
approach with a Web application that organizes data into a structured format
using interactive mind maps and image generation tools. The system is
implemented using the TED-LIUM~3 dataset, which comprises over 2,000 speech
transcripts and audio files of TED Talks. Initial user tests using a System
Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire indicate the application's potential to
simplify the exploration of large speech collections.

Motivation: 挑战任务和领域特定微调的必要性，探索通用文本嵌入模型的潜力。

Method: 使用GTEs进行实验，比较其在顺序推荐和产品搜索中的性能，并通过PCA压缩嵌入维度。

Result: GTEs在两项任务中均表现优异，归因于其在嵌入空间中更均匀的特征分布。

Conclusion: GTEs具有更强的表示能力，且通过PCA压缩可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic
representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential
recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,
while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.
Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to
improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing
that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale
corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and
fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We
attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute
features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that
compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions
(e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of
specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at

Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical
and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and
quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common
linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural
language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and
cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and
drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a
small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning
about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide
normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical
notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we
discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,
and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form
methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to
additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple
counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We
also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility
relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such
as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the
architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and
syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of
logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the
qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical
findings in cognitive science.

Motivation: 通过结合LLM与领域专用工具，提高药物发现流程的效率和准确性。

Method: 框架结合LLM推理与领域工具，执行生物医学数据检索、分子生成、性质预测等任务。

Result: 在针对BCL-2的案例中，框架成功生成多样化分子并优化其性质，提高了药物样分子的比例。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选和结构评估。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 在LLM生成长文本时，如何安全地融入私有信息仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过隔离和裁剪敏感信息，以及从私有令牌的小超集中采样，实现差分隐私。

Result: 计算成本降低8倍，生成的长文本与非私有生成相比成本不到10倍。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk在保护隐私的同时高效生成长文本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调对LLM对齐性的脆弱性，强调需要更鲁棒的微调策略以保持跨领域的安全性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine

relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Result: DOTResize在多个LLM家族和规模上优于现有剪枝技术，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize通过重新投影神经元宽度，有效保留和重新分配信号，是一种高效的模型压缩方法。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an

TL;DR: 本文探讨了世界模型的本质、构建方法及其在人工智能中的应用，提出了一种基于分层、多级和混合连续/离散表示的新架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对开发具有人工（通用）智能的虚拟代理的需求增加，世界模型成为近年来的热门话题。本文旨在澄清世界模型的本质及其目标。

Method: 通过批判现有思想流派，提出了一种基于分层、多级和混合连续/离散表示的新架构，并结合生成和自监督学习框架。

Result: 提出了一种通用世界模型的新架构，展望了由该模型支持的物理、代理和嵌套（PAN）AGI系统。

Conclusion: 世界模型的主要目标是模拟现实世界中所有可操作的可能性，以支持有目的的推理和行动。

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

*Joschka Braun,Bálint Mucsányi,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级方法，通过直接调整主题相关标记的logits来增强生成摘要的主题相关性，避免了资源密集的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的摘要对语言模型仍具挑战性，传统方法如微调资源消耗大，而提示工程在小模型上难以保持主题聚焦。

Method: 提出了三种logits重加权技术：常量偏移、因子缩放和阈值选择，用于在生成过程中增强主题相关词汇的使用。

Result: 在NEWTS数据集上的实验表明，这些方法有效提高了主题相关词汇的使用，尤其是阈值选择法在不影响摘要质量的情况下提升了主题聚焦。

Conclusion: 直接重加权logits是一种实用且资源高效的方法，为精确控制生成文本的主题内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

<details>

Motivation: 解决时空预测任务中复杂模型训练效率低和内存消耗高的问题。

Method: 采用频谱对齐知识蒸馏策略，从教师模型的潜在空间提取多尺度频谱特征，指导学生模型捕捉局部细节和全局模式。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上，MSE降低81.3%，MAE降低52.3%。

Conclusion: SDKD框架有效平衡了高频变化和长期趋势的捕捉，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,

Result: 实验表明，该方法能学习到有意义的表示，提升性能并在动作偏差时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在交互式模拟环境中表现出色，为高级动作规划提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据保护方法在生成式AI中已不足，需明确保护范围和严格实施。

Method: 提出四层分类法（不可用性、隐私保护、可追溯性、可删除性），分析技术方法并揭示监管盲点。

Result: 框架提供了数据效用与控制之间的权衡，为开发者、研究者和监管者提供指导。

Conclusion: 需重新思考现代AI技术中的数据保护，以对齐可信赖的数据实践。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学成像常面临间接、噪声和稀疏的测量数据，需要一种模型无关的方法来重建复杂动态。

Method: NeuralDMD结合神经网络的表达能力与DMD的线性动态模式，实现低维表示和预测。

Result: 在风速场和等离子体演化两个实际问题上，NeuralDMD表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一种通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文学等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI视觉系统与人类视觉存在显著差异，如过度依赖纹理特征、对图像扭曲和对抗攻击缺乏鲁棒性。论文旨在通过模拟人类视觉发展过程来缩小这一差距。

Method: 通过整合心理物理学和神经生理学研究，设计了一种人类启发的视觉发展训练方法（DVD），指导AI系统逐步学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在形状识别、抗干扰和对抗攻击方面表现优异，甚至超越了参数规模更大的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，AI视觉的鲁棒性可以通过优化学习方式而非单纯增加学习量来实现，为更安全、更接近人类视觉的AI系统提供了资源高效的路径。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic

ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test
distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative
expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs
models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and
actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply
depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant
behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种无法治愈的神经退行性疾病，早期检测对延缓病情进展至关重要。本研究旨在通过利用患者历史访问数据，开发一种更准确的预测模型。

Method: 研究提出了一种Transformer模型，用于预测AD患者的下一次临床访问阶段的进展。同时，与多种RNN模型（如LSTM、GRU等）进行了性能比较，并评估了不同特征类别和访问历史的重要性。

Result: 模型在数据缺失和不平衡的情况下表现出色，尤其在识别病情加重的患者方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 该Transformer模型在AD早期诊断和患者预后方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC有效提升了多模态数据融合的质量，代码将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at

Motivation: SAM在训练中通过损失景观几何提升泛化能力，但面临噪声数据和隐私问题。现有数据影响评估工具（如IF）直接应用于SAM不适用或不准。

Method: 开发了两种创新方法：Hessian-based IF（基于闭式度量）和Gradient Trajectory-based IF（利用梯度轨迹信息）。

Result: 实验证明两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，可用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑和增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为SAM中的数据影响评估提供了高效准确的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Motivation: 解决Dreamer算法因潜在空间压缩导致关键信息丢失的问题，同时避免现有方法（如Δ-IRIS和DIAMOND）因直接从像素训练而效率低下的缺点。

Method: 引入EMERALD模型，采用空间潜在状态和MaskGIT预测生成准确的潜在空间轨迹。

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中取得新SOTA性能，首次在10M环境步骤内超越人类专家表现，并解锁全部22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD为世界建模提供了一种高效且准确的替代方案，显著提升了代理性能。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对抗陷阱逃逸（ATEsc）方法，用于在无数据知识蒸馏（DFKD）中识别和过滤OOD样本，以提高对不可信教师的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFKD方法通常假设教师模型可信，但忽略了不可信教师（如NTL教师）对知识蒸馏的负面影响，特别是其对生成器的误导行为。

Method: 提出ATEsc方法，通过分析合成样本的对抗鲁棒性，将其分为ID-like和OOD-like两组，分别用于知识蒸馏和遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验证明ATEsc能有效提升DFKD对NTL教师的鲁棒性，改善知识蒸馏效果。

Conclusion: ATEsc为DFKD提供了一种对抗不可信教师的新方法，解决了OOD知识干扰的问题。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

*Saeed Jamshidiha,Alireza Rezaee,Farshid Hajati,Mojtaba Golzan,Raymond Chiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的Retformer模型，用于通过视网膜成像检测阿尔茨海默病，结合可解释AI技术，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病缺乏有效治疗手段，早期诊断至关重要。视网膜成像作为一种非侵入性方法，具有潜力成为诊断工具。

Method: 采用Transformer架构Retformer，结合Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping算法，可视化特征重要性。

Result: Retformer在多种性能指标上优于基准算法，最高提升11%。

Conclusion: Retformer为阿尔茨海默病的早期诊断提供了高效且可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

*Moti Rattan Gupta,Anupam Sobti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出三种农业特定的自监督学习任务（TD、FP、FF），显著提升了农作物分类和产量预测性能，并在印度全国范围内验证了效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感基础模型（如SatMAE、DoFA）的自监督学习任务忽视了农业景观的独特时间特性（如自然周期），因此需要针对农业场景设计更有效的预训练任务。

Method: 提出三种农业特定的预训练任务：时间差异预测（TD）、时间频率预测（FP）和未来帧预测（FF），并在SICKLE和FTW India数据集上验证。

Result: FF在农作物分类上达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE，TD在多数任务中表现优异；FF在印度全国范围内实现54.2% IoU。

Conclusion: 农业特定的自监督学习任务显著优于现有方法，验证了时间特性在农业遥感中的重要性。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

*Linfeng Ye,Shayan Mohajer Hamidi,Guang Li,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出信息引导扩散采样（IGDS）方法，通过信息论视角解决低IPC下扩散模型生成样本多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在低IPC（每类图像数）设置下生成的样本缺乏多样性，影响数据集蒸馏效果。

Method: 提出最大化原型信息I(X;Y)和上下文信息H(X|Y)的加权和，通过变分估计实现，并集成到扩散模型中。

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上，IGDS显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC场景。

Conclusion: IGDS通过信息论指导扩散采样，有效提升数据集蒸馏性能，尤其在低IPC条件下表现突出。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DANCE提出了一种动态神经架构搜索方法，通过连续演化学习架构分布，解决了现有NAS方法在适应性、成本和性能一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS方法在真实部署中面临适应性差、搜索成本高和性能不一致的挑战。

Method: DANCE将架构搜索重新定义为连续演化问题，引入连续架构分布、统一架构空间和多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在五个数据集上，DANCE在准确性和搜索成本上均优于现有NAS方法，并能适应不同硬件需求。

Conclusion: DANCE通过动态演化显著提升了神经架构搜索的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for
automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical
limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across
scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and
performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

*Wenhao Li,Xiu Su,Jingyi Wu,Feng Yang,Yang Liu,Yi Chen,Shan You,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出SEED方法，通过自我进化蒸馏减少大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多领域表现优异，但幻觉问题限制了其可信度和应用潜力。现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理，增加了推理时间。

Method: 提出SEED方法，通过识别、隔离和清除模型内部知识中的幻觉，并将净化后的知识蒸馏回模型，实现自我进化。同时提出Mode-Seeking Evolving方法和Hallucination Elimination Adapter。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SEED的优越性，显著减少了幻觉问题。例如，LLaVA-1.5在POPE-Random指标上的F1分数从81.3提升到88.3。

Conclusion: SEED方法通过自我进化蒸馏有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，提升了模型性能，且无需依赖外部工具或多轮推理。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

*Hanseon Joo,Hayoung Choi,Ook Lee,Minjong Cheon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MJKAN是一种新型神经网络层，结合了KAN的非线性表达能力和MLP的效率，在函数回归任务中表现优异，但在图像和文本分类中需谨慎调整参数以避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决KANs的高计算成本和性能缺陷，提出一种更高效的混合架构。

Method: 结合FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，构建MJKAN层，并在多种任务中验证其性能。

Result: 在函数回归中优于MLPs，图像和文本分类中性能与MLPs相当，但需调整基础函数数量以优化泛化能力。

Conclusion: MJKAN继承了KAN的理论优势，同时提高了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

*Pablo G. Morato,Charalampos P. Andriotis,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种贝叶斯主动学习策略（ConBatch-BAL），用于预算约束下的批量数据获取，动态阈值和贪婪策略均基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性度量。实验表明，这些策略能减少迭代次数和成本，优于无约束基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，数据点标注成本差异和预算限制阻碍了主动学习策略的采用，因此需要开发适应这些约束的策略。

Method: 提出两种策略：动态阈值策略（在批次内重新分配预算）和贪婪策略（逐步选择最优样本）。两者均基于贝叶斯神经网络的不确定性度量。

Result: 在真实地理空间数据集上的实验表明，ConBatch-BAL策略能减少迭代和成本，甚至优于无约束基线。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL策略在预算和成本约束下表现优异，为实际应用提供了有效的主动学习解决方案。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SESLR是一种新型在线持续学习方法，通过结合睡眠增强的潜在重放方案和脉冲神经网络（SNNs），显著降低了内存开销并减少了任务分类偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算场景需要高效硬件支持的在线持续学习算法，但现有算法存在高内存开销和偏向新任务的问题。

Method: SESLR利用SNNs的二进制脉冲特性存储重放特征，并通过噪声增强的睡眠阶段训练模型以减少分类偏差。

Result: 在Split CIFAR10上，SESLR平均准确率提升近30%，内存消耗仅为基线方法的三分之一；在Split CIFAR10-DVS上，准确率提升约10%，内存开销减少32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR是资源受限边缘计算场景中在线持续学习的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising direction in the
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, offering computational and memory
advantages by harnessing superposition and entanglement. However, QML models
often face challenges in scalability and expressiveness due to hardware
constraints. In this paper, we propose quantum mixture of experts (QMoE), a
novel quantum architecture that integrates the mixture of experts (MoE)
paradigm into the QML setting. QMoE comprises multiple parameterized quantum
circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing
mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input.
The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks,
highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work
paves the way for scalable and interpretable quantum learning frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于计算机视觉的自动化Vug检测模型，用于高效识别地下岩层中的孔洞（vugs），解决了传统手动和半自动方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动和半自动方法存在个体偏差、劳动密集和参数调整不灵活的问题，需要更高效的vug检测方法。

Method: 采用六步法：top-k模式提取、自适应阈值、轮廓识别、聚合、高级过滤及可选低vug区域过滤，并结合统计分析方法。

Result: 模型验证显示其准确性优于专家手动标记，并提供了孔洞数量、均值、标准差等详细指标。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅提高了vug检测效率，还通过统计分析增强了储层孔洞特征的理解。

Abstract: Image logs are crucial in capturing high-quality geological information about
subsurface formations. Among the various geological features that can be
gleaned from Formation Micro Imager log, vugs are essential for reservoir
evaluation. This paper introduces an automated Vug Detection Model, leveraging
advanced computer vision techniques to streamline the vug identification
process. Manual and semiautomated methods are limited by individual bias,
labour-intensity and inflexibility in parameter finetuning. Our methodology
also introduces statistical analysis on vug characteristics. Pre-processing
steps, including logical file extraction and normalization, ensured
standardized and usable data. The sixstep vug identification methodology
encompasses top-k mode extraction, adaptive thresholding, contour
identification, aggregation, advanced filtering, and optional filtering for low
vuggy regions. The model's adaptability is evidenced by its ability to identify
vugs missed by manual picking undertaken by experts. Results demonstrate the
model's accuracy through validation against expert picks. Detailed metrics,
such as count, mean, and standard deviation of vug areas within zones, were
introduced, showcasing the model's capabilities compared to manual picking. The
vug area distribution plot enhances understanding of vug types in the
reservoir. This research focuses on the identification and characterization of
vugs that in turn aids in the better understanding of reservoirs.

TL;DR: LVM4CSI利用计算机视觉模型处理无线通信中的CSI问题，无需微调，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI方法在CSI获取中依赖任务特定神经网络和大量数据的问题。

Method: 将CSI任务映射为计算机视觉任务，转换CSI为视觉格式，并集成轻量可训练层。

Result: 在信道估计、活动识别和定位等任务中表现优异，参数更少。

Conclusion: LVM4CSI提供了一种通用高效的CSI处理框架，减少了对任务特定设计的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of
wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and
complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial
intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and
utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks
(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting
their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we
propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the
structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly
apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to
wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language
model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI
tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats
compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt
extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI
through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human
activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI
achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an
improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%
reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN
design.

TL;DR: RECA-PD是一种新颖的、可解释的交叉注意力架构，用于基于语音的帕金森病早期检测，结合了可解释的语音特征和自监督表示，性能与现有技术相当，同时提供更一致且临床意义更强的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）影响全球超过1000万人，语音障碍常早于运动症状多年出现，因此语音成为早期、非侵入性检测的重要方式。现有深度学习模型虽然准确性高，但缺乏临床所需的可解释性。

Method: 提出RECA-PD架构，结合可解释的语音特征和自监督表示，通过分段处理长录音缓解某些语音任务（如独白）的性能下降。

Result: RECA-PD在语音检测PD方面达到与现有技术相当的准确性，同时提供更一致且临床意义更强的解释。性能与可解释性并非互斥。

Conclusion: RECA-PD展示了性能和可解释性的平衡，未来工作将提升非专业人士对解释的使用性，并探索严重程度估计以增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在音乐性、创造力、节拍一致性等方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Expotion 在多模态音乐生成中表现出色，并提供了新的数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal
Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls -
specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a
novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing
expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and
interactive music generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字人技术的瓶颈在于如何根据文本或语音输入生成自然的动作，DeepGesture旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型，结合文本、语音、情感和种子动作作为输入，引入快速文本转录和情感引导的无分类器扩散，并使用轻量级Transformer进行特征融合。

Result: 在ZeroEGGS数据集上，DeepGesture在手势的自然度和上下文适配上优于基线，支持情感状态插值和泛化到分布外语音。

Conclusion: DeepGesture为多模态、情感感知的数字人技术迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware
digital humans.

Conclusion: 简单的界面修改能有效促使用户输入更多内容并增强心理所有权，而AI扩展建议的效果有限。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

Method: 系统文献综述，分析38项同行评审研究，总结LLMs在设计生命周期中的应用。

Result: LLMs通过提示工程、人机协作等方式重塑设计流程，但仍存在幻觉、提示不稳定等问题。

Conclusion: LLMs是设计中的新兴协作工具，需进一步研究其伦理与有效集成。

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of large language models
(LLMs) in UI/UX design, synthesizing findings from 38 peer-reviewed studies
published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4,
Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from
ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering,
human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping
design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and
limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging
collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive,
and effective integration of these technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在心理学研究中被广泛使用，但存在测量不可靠的问题（如人格评估失效、道德偏好反转等），威胁研究有效性。

Method: 基于双效度框架，提出六阶段工作流程，包括明确研究目标、验证计算工具、控制实验设计、透明执行、适当数据分析及结果报告。

Result: 通过系统验证，可以区分真实的计算现象与测量伪象，如“LLM自我性”评估。

Conclusion: 该工作流程为AI心理学研究提供了稳健的实证基础，强调透明实践和验证工具的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through
an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic
validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement
artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent
practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical
foundation for AI psychology research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化妆对自我表达和自信至关重要，但现有辅助工具未能满足视障人士在化妆流程中的复杂需求。

Method: 通过15名视障化妆用户的实地调查和5名专业化妆师的访谈，分析化妆行为和反馈需求。

Result: 研究发现视障用户依赖触觉策略，面临对称性和评估挑战，并希望获得实时反馈。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于对话交互和情境感知的辅助系统设计框架，以支持独立化妆。

Abstract: Makeup plays a vital role in self-expression, identity, and confidence - yet
remains an underexplored domain for assistive technology, especially for people
with vision impairments. While existing tools support isolated tasks such as
color identification or product labeling, they rarely address the procedural
complexity of makeup routines: coordinating step sequences, managing product
placement, and assessing the final look with accessible feedback. To understand
the real-world process, we conducted a contextual inquiry with 15 visually
impaired makeup users, capturing real-time makeup application behaviors and
their step-by-step information needs and assessment approaches. Our findings
reveal embodied, tactile-first strategies; persistent challenges in blending,
symmetry, and assessment; and a desire for honest, real-time, goal-aligned
feedback. We also interviewed five professional makeup artists, who reviewed
participant makeup videos and provided expert responses to participant-raised
questions and assessment practices. We contribute a taxonomy of feedback needs
in non-visual makeup, and outline design implications for future assistive
systems - emphasizing hands-free, conversational interaction and context-aware,
procedural support for expressive and independent beauty practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了GDGB基准，用于解决动态文本属性图（DyTAG）生成任务中数据集质量差和标准化任务缺失的问题，并设计了新的生成任务和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DyTAG数据集文本质量差，且缺乏针对生成任务的标准化评估方法，限制了DyTAG生成研究的发展。

Method: 提出GDGB基准，包含8个高质量DyTAG数据集，定义了两个新的生成任务（TDGG和IDGG），并设计了多维度评估指标。

Result: 实验表明GDGB能有效评估生成任务，揭示了结构和文本特征在DyTAG生成中的关键作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为生成DyTAG研究提供了基础资源，推动了实际应用的进一步发展。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards
are available at \href{https://gdgb-algo.github.io/}{here}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长期规划任务中容易因错误累积导致不安全或低效行为，限制了其通用性。

Method: 采用模块化架构，LLM行动者选择高层动作，LTLCrit批评器分析轨迹并提出新的LTL约束，结合语言模型的推理能力和形式逻辑的保证。

Result: 在Minecraft钻石挖掘基准测试中，实现了100%完成率，并提高了效率。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督LLM是一种强大且灵活的范式，可实现安全、通用的决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在调用企业API时因工具相似或参数不明确而失败的问题。

Method: 三阶段流程：生成多轮对话、监督微调模型、动态评估模型表现。

Result: 在DiaBENCH动态测试中，DiaFORGE训练的模型比GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet分别提高了27%和49%的工具调用成功率。

Conclusion: DiaFORGE提供了一种可靠的企业级工具调用代理构建方法，并发布了相关数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM问答系统的效率和质量，通过多轮交互自动解决提问中的不完整或模糊问题。

Method: 使用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，分类、解决或回答问题。

Result: 代理架构缩短了交互时间，提高了答案质量，并能解释问题缺陷的解决过程，但可能增加LLM调用和延迟。

Conclusion: 基于代理的方法在大多数情况下优于传统方法，适合开发更健壮的问答系统。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

TL;DR: SmartThinker框架通过两阶段学习优化推理链长度控制，减少冗余推理，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在冗余和低效问题，全局长度惩罚方法效果不佳，需更精细的步骤级控制。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 短形式推理模式适应；2) 步骤级长度控制策略优化（SCPO），包含重要性估计、奖励函数等组件。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SmartThinker显著减少冗余推理，性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: SmartThinker提供了一种高效且精细的推理链长度控制方法，解决了冗余问题并提升了效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning
while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Method: 采用贝叶斯启发的提示策略，尊重临床数据的时间顺序，利用LLM生成临床指导。

Result: 初步实验表明，MedGellan生成的指导提高了诊断性能，尤其是在召回率和F1分数上。

Conclusion: MedGellan为医疗决策提供了一种实用的混合框架，结合了机器智能与人类监督的优势。

Abstract: Medical decision-making is a critical task, where errors can result in
serious, potentially life-threatening consequences. While full automation
remains challenging, hybrid frameworks that combine machine intelligence with
human oversight offer a practical alternative. In this paper, we present
MedGellan, a lightweight, annotation-free framework that uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate clinical guidance from raw medical records, which is
then used by a physician to predict diagnoses. MedGellan uses a
Bayesian-inspired prompting strategy that respects the temporal order of
clinical data. Preliminary experiments show that the guidance generated by the
LLM with MedGellan improves diagnostic performance, particularly in recall and
$F_1$ score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自发思维的动态交互作用，探索语言作为揭示自发认知状态的窗口。

Method: 分析参与者描述这些思维类型的语言模式特征。

Result: Deja Vu以抽象和空间语言为特征，非自愿自传体记忆富含个人情感细节，意外思维表现为不可预测性和认知中断。

Conclusion: 语言分析能深入揭示自发认知状态的表现形式。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

TL;DR: MARBLE是一种多智能体规则驱动的LLM引擎，用于交通事故严重性预测，通过模块化推理和共识机制显著提高了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通事故严重性预测因数据不完整、特征依赖性强和类别不平衡而困难，现有方法难以应对噪声和解释性不足的问题。

Method: MARBLE通过多个专门推理智能体分解任务，每个智能体关注特定特征子集，采用规则或LLM引导的共识机制协调预测。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE准确率接近90%，显著优于传统方法和SOTA提示推理方法（如CoT、L2M、ToT）。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare
applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to
healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy.
Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less
task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of
healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical
vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma
demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,
significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and
approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong
foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to
significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了链式思维（CoT）监控在AI安全防御中的可靠性问题，提出了区分CoT作为合理化与CoT作为计算的概念框架，并强调监控性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究发现CoT监控存在‘不忠实’问题，尤其是在审计偏见等应用中可能成为事后合理化工具，这引发了对CoT可靠性的质疑。

Method: 通过实验增加不良行为的难度，迫使模型暴露其推理过程，使其可监控；并提出压力测试方法以评估CoT监控的抗规避能力。

Result: 研究发现模型可以学会隐藏意图，但需要显著的外部帮助（如详细的人类策略或针对监控的迭代优化）。

Conclusion: 尽管不完美，CoT监控仍是一个重要的防御层，需要主动保护和持续压力测试。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

*Franklin Mingzhe Li,Kaitlyn Ng,Bin Zhu,Patrick Carrington*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSCAR是一个基于对象状态识别的技术框架，旨在为非视觉烹饪提供上下文感知支持，通过整合食谱解析、对象状态提取和实时步骤跟踪，显著提高了步骤预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪对日常生活独立性和幸福感至关重要，但对视力障碍者来说，由于缺乏进度跟踪和上下文反馈的支持，烹饪仍然具有挑战性。对象状态（食材和工具的转化状态）为上下文感知烹饪支持提供了潜力。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，支持实时步骤跟踪。在173个教学视频和12个非视觉烹饪会话数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 对象状态显著提升了跨视觉语言模型的步骤预测准确性，并揭示了影响实际性能的关键因素（如隐含任务、摄像头位置和光照）。

Conclusion: OSCAR为非视觉烹饪提供了有效的上下文感知支持，贡献了技术框架、真实数据集和设计见解，为未来辅助烹饪系统的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个公开的幻灯片动画数据集，并利用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型，在多个指标上显著优于GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI驱动的幻灯片生成工具缺乏动画支持的问题，以及现有视觉语言模型在动画任务上的局限性。

Method: 发布包含12,000个自然语言描述、动画JSON文件和渲染视频的数据集，并使用LoRA微调Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L、SPICE和CODA指标上显著提升，尤其在CODA细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA增强模型和CODA指标为未来动态幻灯片生成研究提供了基准和基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于聚类任务，因此提出了CLUDI框架。

Method: CLUDI采用师生范式，教师模型通过随机扩散采样生成多样化的聚类分配，学生模型将其优化为稳定的预测。

Result: CLUDI在多个数据集上表现出色，实现了无监督分类的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CLUDI为高维数据的聚类提供了鲁棒性和适应性，设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,
have not yet been applied to clustering. We introduce Clustering via Diffusion
(CLUDI), a self-supervised framework that combines the generative power of
diffusion models with pre-trained Vision Transformer features to achieve robust
and accurate clustering. CLUDI is trained via a teacher-student paradigm: the
teacher uses stochastic diffusion-based sampling to produce diverse cluster
assignments, which the student refines into stable predictions. This
stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Monty的千脑系统，旨在模拟生物智能的快速持续学习和结构化知识表示，并在3D物体感知任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统缺乏生物智能的核心特性，如快速持续学习和基于感知运动的表示。受神经科学启发，千脑系统试图通过模拟皮质柱结构缩小这一差距。

Method: 通过Monty系统评估其在3D物体识别和姿态估计任务中的表现，利用YCB数据集测试其感知运动学习和模块化架构。

Result: Monty通过结构化表示和模块化设计实现了鲁棒的泛化能力，支持快速推理和高效学习。

Conclusion: 千脑系统是一种有前景的AI新方法，Monty的初步成果验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Result: 实验表明，FurniMAS在生成高质量3D装饰方面显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FurniMAS通过多代理协作，成功实现了高效且高质量的家具装饰自动化。

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and
requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore
how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是比较IL和RL在手术动作规划中的表现，探索RL是否优于IL。

Method: 提出了双任务自回归模仿学习（DARIL）基线，并评估了三种RL变体：基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强。

Result: DARIL表现最佳（34.6% mAP），而所有RL方法表现较差（最低3.1% mAP）。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在专家标注测试集上，IL优于RL，挑战了RL在顺序决策中的优越性假设。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Motivation: 探索口音强度与发音特征的关系，为自动化口音分析和语音处理提供支持。

Method: 利用自监督学习的发音反演技术估计发音特征，并通过音素级差异量化口音强度。

Result: 舌位模式在英式和美式英语中存在显著差异，尤其在rhotic和低后元音中。

Conclusion: 研究为口音分析和发音建模提供了新方法，有助于语音处理应用。

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory
features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare
phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based
references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength.
The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory
inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of
read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines
correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength
proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent
strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two
dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back
vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory
modeling for speech processing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非侵入式评估模型仅预测语音的单一平均意见分数（MOS），无法泛化到其他音频领域。

Method: MMMOS融合了三个预训练编码器的帧级嵌入，并评估了三种聚合策略和四种损失函数。

Result: MMMOS在多个指标上表现优异，包括误差减少20-30%、相关性提升4-5%，并在多个挑战指标中排名靠前。

Conclusion: MMMOS显著提升了多领域音频质量评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating
audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive
assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging
diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose
MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that
estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity,
Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and
environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained
encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with
four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30%
reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus
baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and
ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Motivation: 大语言模型训练成本高，模型重用普遍，现有水印技术对持续训练不鲁棒，威胁模型归属和版权保护。

Method: 利用注意力参数矩阵的标准差分布作为指纹，因其在持续训练中保持稳定。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，并发现华为Pangu Pro MoE模型可能基于Qwen-2.5 14B模型升级而非从头训练。

Conclusion: 开发鲁棒指纹方法对保护大模型知识产权至关重要，持续训练无法完全掩盖模型来源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant copyright and intellectual
property challenges as the cost of training increases and model reuse becomes
prevalent. While watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect model
ownership, they may not be robust to continue training and development, posing
serious threats to model attribution and copyright protection. This work
introduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based
on intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation
distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit
distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued
training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints
that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright
infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication. Notably,
our investigation uncovers evidence that a recently Pangu Pro MoE model
released by Huawei is derived from Qwen-2.5 14B model through upcycling
techniques rather than training from scratch, highlighting potential cases of
model plagiarism, copyright violation, and information fabrication. These
findings underscore the critical importance of developing robust fingerprinting
methods for protecting intellectual property in large-scale model development
and emphasize that deliberate continued training alone is insufficient to
completely obscure model origins.

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based
security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we
present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning
techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as
their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing
to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for
guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its
application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage
functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the
field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing
multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization,
reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised
finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of
RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of
LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会和技术中的重要性增加，确保其安全性变得至关重要。越狱攻击利用漏洞绕过安全防护，但相关机制尚不明确。

Method: 研究发现越狱攻击中普遍存在“注意力滑移”现象，并提出“注意力锐化”防御方法，通过温度缩放调整注意力分数分布。

Result: 实验表明，注意力锐化能有效抵抗多种越狱攻击，且在良性任务上保持性能，且无额外计算或内存开销。

Conclusion: 注意力锐化是一种高效实用的防御方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and
technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit
vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.
However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this
paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:
Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the
attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack
process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is
consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token
replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.
Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token
Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention
Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of
mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,
a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the
attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four
leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)
show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while
maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention
Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it
an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: AttackBench为对抗攻击的鲁棒性验证提供了可靠的基础，解决了评估中的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion
attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often
remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched
models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can
lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness
claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a
false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation
reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess
the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible
conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack
implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers
and practitioners to identify the most reliable and effective attack for use in
subsequent robustness evaluations. The framework enforces consistent testing
conditions and enables continuous updates, making it a reliable foundation for
robustness verification.

<details>

Motivation: 解决基于文本提示的图像编辑技术可能引发的伦理和版权问题，防止未经授权的修改。

Method: 将图像分为允许和禁止集，对禁止集引入模糊或语义模糊的输出训练目标，同时保持允许集的高质量编辑。

Result: SecureT2I在多个数据集和模型上有效降低了禁止集的编辑质量，同时保持了允许集的性能，且泛化能力优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SecureT2I通过选择性编辑策略，成功平衡了安全性和编辑质量，为扩散模型的安全应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image manipulation with diffusion models enables flexible and
precise editing based on prompts, but raises ethical and copyright concerns due
to potential unauthorized modifications. To address this, we propose SecureT2I,
a secure framework designed to prevent unauthorized editing in diffusion-based
generative models. SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and
domain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning
without architectural changes. We categorize images into a permit set and a
forbid set based on editing permissions. For the permit set, the model learns
to perform high-quality manipulations as usual. For the forbid set, we
introduce training objectives that encourage vague or semantically ambiguous
outputs (e.g., blurred images), thereby suppressing meaningful edits. The core
challenge is to block unauthorized editing while preserving editing quality for
permitted inputs. To this end, we design separate loss functions that guide
selective editing behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and
models show that SecureT2I effectively degrades manipulation quality on
forbidden images while maintaining performance on permitted ones. We also
evaluate generalization to unseen inputs and find that SecureT2I consistently
outperforms baselines. Additionally, we analyze different vagueness strategies
and find that resize-based degradation offers the best trade-off for secure
manipulation control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习水印模型在嵌入容量和抗比特错误能力上不足，无法满足数字签名等加密应用的需求。

Method: 结合裁剪容量扩展机制和ERPA模块（基于DCSS的轻量级错误校正），无需微调现有模型。

Result: Z.B.I.R从1.2%提升至86.3%，支持公开验证和抗篡改。

Conclusion: README填补了信号级水印与加密安全之间的空白，为高保障应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for
robust image authentication and protection. However, existing models are
limited by low embedding capacity and vulnerability to bit-level errors, making
them unsuitable for cryptographic applications such as digital signatures,
which require over 2048 bits of error-free data. In this paper, we propose
README (Robust Error-Aware Digital Signature via Deep WaterMarking ModEl), a
novel framework that enables robust, verifiable, and error-tolerant digital
signatures within images. Our method combines a simple yet effective
cropping-based capacity scaling mechanism with ERPA (ERror PAinting Module), a
lightweight error correction module designed to localize and correct bit errors
using Distinct Circular Subsum Sequences (DCSS). Without requiring any
fine-tuning of existing pretrained watermarking models, README significantly
boosts the zero-bit-error image rate (Z.B.I.R) from 1.2% to 86.3% when
embedding 2048-bit digital signatures into a single image, even under
real-world distortions. Moreover, our use of perceptual hash-based signature
verification ensures public verifiability and robustness against tampering. The
proposed framework unlocks a new class of high-assurance applications for deep
watermarking, bridging the gap between signal-level watermarking and
cryptographic security.

Motivation: 探讨为何美国股市收益主要来自隔夜时段，而日内收益表现不佳。

Method: 使用240万篇新闻文章，采用监督式主题分析技术，筛选能解释市场收益的新闻主题。

Result: 新闻主题的流行度变化和市场反应差异共同影响隔夜与日内收益差异。方法能预测隔夜表现优异和日内表现不佳的股票。

Conclusion: 新闻是解释隔夜与日内收益差异的重要因素，与其他文献提出的机制形成对比。

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have
been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or
flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through
features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4
million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis
that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous
market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics
and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the
difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our
approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and
particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of
continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the
effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain
overnight returns.

### [510] [Street design and driving behavior: evidence from a large-scale study in Milan, Amsterdam, and Dubai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04434)
*Giacomo Orsi,Titus Venverloo,Andrea La Grotteria,Umberto Fugiglando,Fábio Duarte,Paolo Santi,Carlo Ratti*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，仅降低限速不足以有效减少车速，街道设计对限速遵守至关重要。通过计算机视觉分析，窄街和高密度建筑环境有助于降低车速，而视野开阔的道路则相反。研究还验证了方法在其他城市的适用性，并开发了预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市降低限速以提升道路安全、减少噪音污染和促进可持续交通，但如何确保驾驶员遵守新限速是规划者的挑战。

Method: 利用计算机视觉语义分割模型分析Google街景图像，研究街道特征对车速的影响，并在米兰、阿姆斯特丹和迪拜验证结果。

Result: 窄街和高密度建筑环境与较低车速相关，视野开阔的道路则相反。方法在其他城市验证有效，并开发了预测模型。

Conclusion: 街道设计对限速遵守至关重要，研究为城市规划者提供了实用工具和设计指南。

Abstract: In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h
to 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote
sustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these
new limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates
drivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how
street characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that
the mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving
speeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can
improve speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply
computer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View
images. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built
environments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater
visibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the
influence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed
methodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to
Milan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and
Dubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric
design. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in
Milan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines
for driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a
machine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street
characteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the
compliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed
limit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners,
supporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.

*Dumitran Adrian Marius,Theodor-Pierre Moroianu,Buca Mihnea-Vicentiu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高级计算机科学竞赛中的表现，揭示了其优缺点，并探讨了伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在高级计算机科学教育和竞赛中的潜力与局限性。

Method: 构建了一个双语多模态数据集，并系统评估了LLMs在理论编程任务中的表现。

Result: 揭示了LLMs的优缺点，包括语言选择的影响，并讨论了伦理问题。

Conclusion: 为计算机科学教育和竞赛中LLMs的应用提供了见解，并发布了数据集和教育应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various
domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising
questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This
study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)
dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science
competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived
such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for
others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The
Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical
programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current
LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),
providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition
settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding
educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM
usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and
policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly
available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational
application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using
the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

### [513] [From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996)
*Jiangbo Yu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出“代理车辆”（AgVs）概念，区别于传统自动驾驶车辆（AuVs），强调其具备认知和社交能力，并提出了系统级框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶车辆的定义无法涵盖其与人类和机器的交互、目标适应等复杂行为，需引入代理AI以填补技术自主性与未来需求间的概念差距。

Method: 提出AgVs的系统级框架，整合代理AI、机器人技术、多智能体系统及人机交互的进展，突出其认知和通信层。

Result: AgVs通过高级推理和工具使用，成为嵌入移动生态系统的交互代理，而非仅计算工具。

Conclusion: 开发AgVs面临安全、实时控制、公众接受度、伦理对齐和监管框架等挑战。

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity
to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly,
autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their
environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.
However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase
vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE
levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,
contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly
with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.
These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the
broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered
mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles
(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and
interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level
framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative
layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant
advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine
interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and
tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive
agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key
challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety,
real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory
frameworks.

Conclusion: 该模拟器的可微分性结合语义标签，能够学习环境的电磁特性，为无线电传播模拟提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used deterministic method for radio propagation
simulations, capable of producing physically accurate multipath components. The
accuracy depends on the quality of the environment model and its
electromagnetic properties. Recent advances in computer vision and machine
learning have made it possible to reconstruct detailed environment models
augmented with semantic segmentation labels.
  In this letter, we propose a differentiable ray tracing-based radio
propagation simulator that operates directly on point clouds. We showcase the
efficiency of our method by simulating multi-bounce propagation paths with up
to five interactions with specular reflections and diffuse scattering in two
indoor scenarios, each completing in less than 90 ms. Lastly, we demonstrate
how the differentiability of electromagnetic computations can be combined with
segmentation labels to learn the electromagnetic properties of the environment.
