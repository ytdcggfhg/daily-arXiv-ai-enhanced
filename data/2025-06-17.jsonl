However, creating open-ended study or\nexamination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This\nthesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded\nin class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a\nsophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically\ntargeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks,\nincluding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that\nhigh-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study\nmaterial. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short\nanswers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of\nvarious grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models\n(LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from\ntheir pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of\nthe LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need\nhuman oversight, especially in examination scenarios."}

We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from\nconsumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition\nargumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both\ngeneral manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals\nthree key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative\nwhen explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in\napproximately 84\\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to\nbe ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently\ndefault to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and\nfear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as\nBERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with\nlarger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet\nreliable for real-world oversight.

While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual\nsupervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent\naudio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates\naudio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic\ncontent of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the\ncontext of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping\nmethod by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals\nextracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video\nlabel spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection\nbetween the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the\ngenerated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines\nthe optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes\nin loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized\nadaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used\ndatasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed\naudio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach.

However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of\nconcept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated\nwith the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a\nblind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and\nthus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,\nimpairing model interpretability.

MGDFIS comprises three\nsynergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries\ntoken-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight\nspectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration\nModule, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and\nparallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and\nthe Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps\nto rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen\nresponses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone\nbenchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,\nachieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an\noptimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a\npractical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV\nplatforms."}

This approach\nenables the model to adaptively employ both reasoning patterns: it prioritizes\nthe Short CoT patterns and activates the Long CoT patterns only when necessary.\nExperiments on various mathematical datasets demonstrate that QFFT reduces\naverage response length by more than 50\\%, while achieving performance\ncomparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, QFFT exhibits\nsuperior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource\nscenarios."}

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method\nfor blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates\napplication across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for\ntraining-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate\nthe features before and after dropout adaptively.

This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures.

We\nconduct a comparative analysis of conversations between LLMs and human users on\nsocial media platforms, using five advanced models: three open-source LLMs\n(Gemma, Llama 3, and Llama 3.3) and two commercial systems (GPT-4o by OpenAI\nand Claude 3.5 by Anthropic). Through sentiment analysis, we assess the\nemotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results\nreveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs\nconsistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment\nthan human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across\ncontexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings\nsuggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the\nquality of public discourse on controversial topics.

Existing\njailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or\nsuffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms\nof these models.\n  In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic\ncomplexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any\nadded prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs\ndirectly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.\n  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a\njailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,\ninformation-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.\nSpecifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase\nmalicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is\nunsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the\nfailure while preserving its malicious intent.\n  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used\nLLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their\njailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks,\nachieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing\ndefenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM,\nfail to mitigate these attacks. This highlights a critical weakness in\ntraditional AI safety guardrails when confronted with information\noverload-based jailbreaks."}

To tackle this, we introduce Multiple Aspects of\nPlanning (MAoP), enabling LLMs to conduct wide-horizon thinking to solve\ncomplex planning problems. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the\nstrategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the\nplanning blueprint for planning models, enabling strong inference-time\nscalability for better performance. In addition, current benchmarks overlook\ntravel's dynamic nature, where past events impact subsequent journeys, failing\nto reflect real-world feasibility. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an\nagent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world travel simulation. This\nwork advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights\nfor evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation."}

In\nour paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a\nsemantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to\nencode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without\npredefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,\nwhich accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a\ncomplete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their\nrelations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or\npredefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate\nsemantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged\nsuperpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency.

To\naddress these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary\nframework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a\nparticular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud\nframework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,\nand cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model\ninference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to\na series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling\neffective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource\nconstraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based\nintelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow.

Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment.

A popular class of methods, based on\nDiffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable\nposterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression\nfor the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in\nterms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze\nthe time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step\nsizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that\nthese step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as\ncolorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity,\nthis approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables\nsampling with fewer time steps than DPS."}

Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously\nprovide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model\nresponses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal\nexperience."}

A fundamental challenge in\ndeveloping such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with\nthe robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly\nfine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers\nfrom a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and\nheavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level\nsemantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical\nspace; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models\nanticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\ntraining paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve\nalignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state\nestimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model\nto gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting\nperformance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in\nlow-data regimes."}

Specifically, we recast\nPDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward\nprediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states\nfrom initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based\narchitecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer\nmissing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video\ndiffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,\nwhile enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.\nExtensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model\noffers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and\nproblem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

Given a\nfull-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local,\nhigh-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and\nscale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance\npaired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to\nlearn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply\nthe model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these\npairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full\nimage for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,\nrobust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,\nin-the-wild captures.

We introduce VisuoTactile Local\n(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation\ntasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a\nvision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the\nobject of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,\nscene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric\nvision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that\nwhile scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across\ntask instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they\ncan generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%\nsuccess on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to\ndistractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)\nfoundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via\nbehavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies\nlearned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts\nperformance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these\ninsights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs,\nenabling robust, reusable low-level skills.

In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss\nvalue for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the\noptimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,\nand develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant\nscalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias.

Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B\nparameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting\nthe optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled\nsetting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models."}
