While\nprior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable\nrepresentations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and\npropagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,\nwe propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how\npredictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations\nand target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to\ntrace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during\ntraining. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a\nconsistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle\nlayers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,\nreflecting a transition between generalization and memorization.

To address these challenges, we developed a vision\nguided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed\npresence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation\nin real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep\nlearning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,\nand uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated\nnozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted\nusing 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to\nsimulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean\naverage precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close\nto 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision\nof 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water\nsensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones\nwhere canopy was present.

However, because data from different modalities are\ntypically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental\nconditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution\ndiscrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.\nFurthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater\nchallenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the\ninconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to\neffectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To\nfurther address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning\ncomplementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as\nauxiliary modalities.

This paper\nintroduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional\ndiffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a\nstaged joint optimization strategy.

Existing works pay more attention to\nimproving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding\nspeed.

Moreover, these convolution-based video\nrepresentation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds\nper frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose\nGSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS\nand 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.\nSpecifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of\nthe video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and\nthe polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object\nmotion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing\nstrategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)\nbased on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion\nand non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to\navoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to\ncompress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the\nBunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than\nexisting methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other\nmethods.

Thus, we introduce our new\nRAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a \"think before answering\"\nstrategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by\nutilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought.

It\nenables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a\nmodification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding\nthe considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its\nnascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and\nnoisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,\nand 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is\noverlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias.

However, when applied to PolSAR data, traditional real-valued\ndiffusion models face challenges in capturing complex-valued phase\ninformation.Moreover, these models often struggle to preserve fine structural\ndetails. To address these limitations, we leverage the Contourlet transform,\nwhich provides rich multiscale and multidirectional representations well-suited\nfor PolSAR imagery. We propose a structural knowledge-guided complex diffusion\nmodel for PolSAR image classification in the Contourlet domain.

A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct\nvalidity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended\ntrait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.\nTo make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation\nusing LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which\nthe same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By\nsimulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that\nrobustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items.

These methods adopt handcraft templates or learnable vectors to provide\ntext or image instructions in fine-tuning VLMs. However, most existing works\nignore the structural relationships between learnable prompts and tokens within\nand between modalities. Moreover, balancing the performance of base and new\nclasses remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an\nIntegrated Structural Prompt (ISP) for VLMs to enhance the interaction of\ninformation representations between the text and image branches. ISP introduces\nself-structural and cross-structural prompt modules to model the structural\nrelationships between learnable prompts and frozen tokens within and across\nmodalities.

Vision-based pose\nestimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling\nsolution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting\nconditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,\nblooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic\nor event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,\nevent sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced\nsignal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work\naddresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion\napproach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to\nachieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique\nwas developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to\nachieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The\npipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme\nconditions that affect either channel.

However, these\ndatasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving\nthe impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or\ndepth-sensor mode - and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate\nsuch variations - largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our\ndataset show that applying sensor control during test-time induces greater\nperformance improvement over digital data augmentation, achieving performance\ncomparable to or better than costly increases in real-world training data\nquantity and diversity. Adapting either RGB or depth sensors individually is\neffective, while jointly adapting multimodal RGB-D configurations yields even\ngreater improvements.

Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS\ngeneralizes across scenes without per-scene optimization.

To advance latent\nreasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\nemerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role\nof neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,\nhighlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.\nNext, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including\nactivation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning\nstrategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces.

To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the\ncontext of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,\nrobustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater\nstability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.\nBased on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,\nmetrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5341\u79cd\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5341\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5206\u4e3a\u4e94\u7c7b\uff09\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6270\u52a8\u6cd5\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5728\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6307\u6807\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an\nend-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to\niteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,\nbased on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation\nframework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly\nadditional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge\nrobust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a\nbinary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.\nAdditionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual\ngrounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we\ndesign a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss\ncomputation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby\npromoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when\ntrained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding\nannotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared\nto GRPO, leading to 5.4\\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and\n5.2\\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.\nNotably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses\nOpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench.

To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a\nfully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test\ncases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario\nrepository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe\ngenerates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven\nDevelopment) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions\nare further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty\nlevels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides\na comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the\napplicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16\nLLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer\nmulti-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The\ncode for CorePipe is available at\nhttps://github.com/AGI-Eval-Official/CoreCodeBench, and the data for\nCoreCodeBench can be accessed at\nhttps://huggingface.co/collections/tubehhh/corecodebench-68256d2faabf4b1610a08caa.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CorePipe\u548cCoreCodeBench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u591a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CorePipe\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86CoreCodeBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u591a\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u7c7b\u539f\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e8616\u79cdLLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "CoreCodeBench\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

We\nargue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge\nfoundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure\nLLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e09\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u9632\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5feb\u901f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5927\u652f\u67f1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\uff08\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff09\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u9632\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534763%\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548c\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u754c\u9762\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u9632\u5fa1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that\nrequire pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.\nHowever, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in\nlocalization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization.

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,\nsuch as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text\nrendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error\nRate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality\non high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6GCDA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u8bfb\u4e14\u62fc\u5199\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "GCDA\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u53cc\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548cOCR\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3001\u907f\u514d\u5b57\u7b26\u5931\u771f\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGCDA\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\uff08\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u73870.08\uff09\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08FID 14.3\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GCDA\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a\ndefense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning\nwhile preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based\ntoxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and\nsafety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming\nindustry API services.

Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs).

Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities.

Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR\nevaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in\nrecognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive\nevaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context\nlearning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.\nThe dataset and evaluation code have been released at\nhttps://github.com/MrSupW/ContextASR-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aContextASR-Bench\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5305\u542b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfASR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LALMs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3aASR\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b40,000\u6761\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8986\u76d610\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684LALMs\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfASR\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ContextASR-Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86ASR\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce a novel\nChinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records\nannotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme\nassesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and\nICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.\nCrucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate\nhow different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP\nand its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared\nto negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating\npredictive bias in model outputs.

Previous methods\nrely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to\nmisalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene\ngeometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the\naccumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in\nblurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose\nRef-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected\ncomponents to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric\nconsistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch\nrepresentation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency\nreflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo\nreflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we\nincorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness\nconstraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms\nclassical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with\nNeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)\ndriven reflection editing.

To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose\na prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image\naugmentation.

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline.

On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed\nhigh concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and\ncircumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance\ncorrelation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the\ncircumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal\nand 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable\nperformance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process\nimaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based\nframework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is\nfast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.\nThese features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale\ndata collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to\ncharacterize plaque composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7eb5\u5411\u548c\u5706\u5468\u914d\u51c6IVUS\u548cOCT\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0IVUS\u548cOCT\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6210\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "DL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u7eb5\u5411>0.99\uff0c\u5706\u5468>0.90\uff09\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4<90\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6210\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

First, we pre-train a\nLanguage-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT\nimages into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our\nfindings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to\nadvance LDCT denoising.
