We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the\ndegree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social\nbiases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems\nthrough scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined\ncontexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent\njudging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses\nlabeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)\nacross four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses\nassigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior\nresponse.

McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the\ninfluence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR\nclassification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),\ndriven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved\nin the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For\nglaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1\n<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes\n(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.\nGPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but\nlacks precision for complex tasks.

While recent\nadvances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models\nare computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that\ncombines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.\nLike biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast\ncues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel\nDifference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,\nPDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues\nare extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference\nconvolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard\nconvolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.\nAdditionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for\nvideo SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast\ncapture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve\nsignificant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique.

Many\nendeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and\ngenerate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate\nthe drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and\napplications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to\nretrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods\noften fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this\nchallenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and\nfind the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the\nobservation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next\ntoken, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec\ngenerates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate\nthe next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token\nand the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks.

We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and\nadversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among\nGaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the\nimaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out\nnon-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness and superiority of PGA.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we\npropose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that\nsequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual\nrepresentations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection\nmodel's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores.

To handle\nthis, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic\nThreshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and\nimproves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also\nleverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and\nDINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise\nbounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's\nzero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The\nquality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance\nto our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an\nobject matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the\naverage maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,\ncalculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance\nbetween each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image\ngrid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and\nmask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.\nWe empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,\noutperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the\nBOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\"\ntask.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Grounded-SAM 2\u548cDINOv2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u9608\u503c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u5404\u79cd\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982CNOS\u3001SAM-6D\u548cNIDS-Net\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528DINOv2\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u9608\u503c\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNOCTIS\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6RGB\u548cRGB-D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCTIS\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding.

By enabling\nthe direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it\ntransforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into\nproactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in\nintelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f20\u9012\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5230\u4e3b\u52a8\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u65f6\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong\ntheoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to\ndata poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates\non top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement\nsuitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in\naddition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we\ndemonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing\nhow a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a\nbenchmark of reasoning datasets.

However, the\nanswer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows\nmodels to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the\nreasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts\nthrough common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although\nslow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from\nunderthinking.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

In\nthis paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating\ntwo key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical\ninterpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images\nby modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and\nensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We\nfurther introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention\nmodules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent\ntransitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreeMorph\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49/\u5e03\u5c40\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7403\u9762\u63d2\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8eab\u4efd\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "result": "FreeMorph\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5f62\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb10~50\u500d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "FreeMorph\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5f62\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task.

This compatibility, if it exists, raises a\nfundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of\nalignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?\nWe cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task\n- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual\ncoherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that\njointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of\npre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both\nreconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as\na method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure\nfrom disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design\naxes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its\nhard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at\nwhich alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model\nscale on representational convergence.

LCS programs herald a\ngenerational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related\nearly-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of\nradiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a\ncomputationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT\nanalysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays\nthe foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools\nthat could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular\nfocus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management\nin high-risk populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "TANGERINE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\uff08LDCT\uff09\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LDCT\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u77ed\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u80ba\u764c\u7b5b\u67e5\uff08LCS\uff09\u9879\u76ee\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u79cd\u65e9\u671f\u80ba\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u572898,000\u591a\u4f8b\u80f8\u90e8LDCT\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u75283D\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u572814\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u80ba\u764c\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "TANGERINE\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5c06LCS\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u80ba\u764c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5411\u5168\u9762\u7684\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}
