### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个手动标注的老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取的语料库，填补了临床NLP资源中老年人群的空白。数据集包含14种临床显著AEs及上下文属性，支持不连续和重叠实体标注。评估显示，BERT等模型在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度任务（如罕见事件）上表现下降（F1=0.675），凸显了临床语言复杂性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床NLP资源中代表性不足，且现有研究很少处理不连续和重叠实体的标注问题。

Method: 使用FlairNLP评估多个模型（如BERT-cased）在三种标注粒度（细粒度、粗粒度、带否定的粗粒度）上的表现。

Result: BERT在粗粒度任务上表现优异（F1=0.943），但在细粒度任务（如罕见事件）上表现较差（F1=0.675）。

Conclusion: 尽管模型在粗粒度任务上表现良好，但细粒度任务和复杂临床语言的提取仍具挑战性。数据集通过DataLoch提供，可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoostCD结合约束和无约束解码，通过两阶段预测提升结构化NLP任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在约束解码时输出质量低的问题。

Method: 两阶段解码：第一阶段分别进行约束和无约束解码，第二阶段通过增强模型结合预测。

Result: BoostIE在封闭信息提取任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BoostCD通过互补性错误利用显著提升性能。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrEst是一个弱监督框架，用于在LLM推理中评估上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略上下文文档可信度的差异，可能导致不可靠信息传播。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性自动评估可信度，提出黑盒和白盒两种集成策略。

Result: 在三个模型架构和五个数据集上，CrEst显著优于基线，准确率提升26.86%，F1分数提升3.49%。

Conclusion: CrEst在无人工标注下有效提升LLM性能，且在高噪声条件下表现稳健。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MDBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在多文档推理任务上的新数据集，通过合成生成过程高效创建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对多文档推理的评估基准，且传统方法标注成本高。

Method: 采用基于结构化种子知识的合成生成技术，通过LLM辅助编辑生成文档集和QA示例。

Result: MDBench对现有LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战，且生成技术便于针对性分析和快速适应新需求。

Conclusion: MDBench填补了多文档推理评估的空白，其生成方法高效且灵活。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的应用，比较了零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法的有效性，并评估了开源与专有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Pima Indian Diabetes Database（PIDD）进行实证分析，评估六种LLMs（包括开源和专有模型）与传统机器学习模型的性能。

Result: 专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少样本设置中准确率最高，Gemma-2-27B的F1分数优于传统模型。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测任务中具有潜力，但需进一步研究提示工程和混合方法以提高性能。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过引入特殊记忆令牌，可以生成可逆的句子嵌入，使LLM在不修改权重的情况下精确重建原始文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在不修改权重的情况下精确重建原始文本的能力。

Method: 通过训练优化特殊记忆令牌的嵌入，使其能够重建固定序列。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型成功重建了长达240个令牌的序列，包括Llama 3.1 8B在内的多种规模模型均表现良好。

Conclusion: 这一发现展示了LLM的新能力，并可能在记忆检索、压缩和可控文本生成中有潜在应用。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用自然语言处理技术分析自杀案例中的社会隔离与孤独感，开发高质量分类器并识别相关风险因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离和孤独感近年增加，与自杀率密切相关，但未被美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）记录。

Method: 使用主题建模生成词典，结合监督学习分类器分析执法和法医叙述。

Result: 开发出高质量分类器（F1平均0.86，准确率0.82），识别出1,198例慢性社会隔离案例，发现男性、同性恋和离婚者风险更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可改进美国社会隔离与孤独感的监测和预防。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrefBERT是一种用于评估开放式生成长文本的评分模型，通过提供比传统指标更优的语义奖励反馈，支持GRPO训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时，常忽略关键方面（如连贯性、风格或相关性），或受预训练数据偏见影响。

Method: 提出PrefBERT，基于多样长文本风格和Likert评分质量的数据集训练，为GRPO提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多句子和段落长度响应中表现可靠，与传统指标相比，能更好地与人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，生成的响应更符合人类偏好，优于传统指标。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，学习时的知识编码方式对后验遗忘（unlearning）效果有重要影响，尤其是使用转述描述能提升遗忘性能，但从文本块中遗忘单个知识仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在现实中的广泛应用，后验遗忘能力变得至关重要，以满足隐私法规和修正有害或过时内容的需求。

Method: 通过实验研究学习时知识编码方式对遗忘效果的影响，重点关注转述描述和文本块中的知识遗忘。

Result: 发现使用转述描述能提升遗忘性能，但从文本块中遗忘单个知识较为困难。

Conclusion: 学习时的知识编码方式对实现可靠的后验遗忘具有关键作用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对话话语解析的增强方法，通过引入DCM模块和CPO优化技术，显著提升了解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的语言特征（如省略和习语）常导致话语关系模糊，增加了解析难度。

Method: 提出DCM模块（包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理）和CPO优化技术，以减少错误澄清。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上，方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DCM和CPO有效解决了对话话语解析中的模糊问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CKD-EHR框架通过知识蒸馏技术提升EHR疾病预测模型的效率和准确性，显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在医学知识表示不足和临床部署效率低下的问题。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型生成软标签，通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制将知识迁移至轻量BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，诊断准确率提升9%，F1-score提高27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR显著提升资源利用效率和诊断准确性，为临床资源优化提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架（MRG和PS），通过分解开放域对话生成任务来显式建模其一对多特性，并引入新数据集o2mDial和评估方法，显著提升了小模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话具有一对多特性，现有LLM对话代理未显式建模此特性，导致多样性不足。

Method: 将对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和基于偏好的选择（PS），引入o2mDial数据集，并提出新的上下文学习和指令调优策略。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升小模型的响应多样性和质量（最高提升90%），接近大模型性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多特性可有效提升开放域对话的多样性和质量，为小模型优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok是一种新的韩语分词器，通过规则预分词和基于分支熵的词汇选择算法，降低分词数量10%，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种高效的韩语分词器，减少分词数量（降低fertility）而不影响模型性能。

Method: 采用规则预分词方法，结合韩语语言结构，并使用基于分支熵的词汇选择算法构建种子词汇表。

Result: 实验显示，Thunder-Tok分词数量减少约10%，推理速度提升10%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-Tok通过语言学方法设计高效分词器，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

*Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Hilal AlQuabeh,Munachiso S Nwadike,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了状态空间语言模型中的记忆机制，通过首因效应和近因效应揭示了信息如何随时间保留和遗忘。在Mamba架构中观察到U型准确度曲线，并识别出三种机制：长期记忆、短期记忆和动态记忆分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型中信息保留和遗忘的行为模式，以理解记忆机制如何影响模型性能。

Method: 应用结构化回忆任务于Mamba架构，分析首因和近因效应，并通过目标消融和输入扰动验证发现。

Result: 发现长期记忆由稀疏通道支持，短期记忆受delta调制递归影响，记忆分配受语义规律动态调节。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Mamba模型中记忆机制的复杂性，为未来语言模型设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了专有和开源大语言模型（LLMs）在可持续发展目标（SDGs）文本分类任务中的表现，并比较了零样本学习、少样本学习和微调的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SDGs数据规模庞大且复杂，传统方法难以追踪进展，因此需要高效的文本分类工具。

Method: 研究分析了多种LLMs在SDGs文本分类任务中的表现，并测试了零样本学习、少样本学习和微调的效果。

Result: 优化后的小模型表现可与大型模型（如GPT）媲美。

Conclusion: 通过提示工程优化的小模型在SDGs文本分类任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

TL;DR: ProtoReasoning框架通过抽象推理原型提升LLM的推理能力，实验显示在逻辑推理、规划任务等方面均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大推理模型跨领域泛化能力的机制，假设共享的抽象推理原型是泛化的基础。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架，包括自动原型构建、验证系统和可扩展性问题合成。

Result: 在逻辑推理、规划任务等多项测试中表现优于基线模型，验证了原型学习的泛化优势。

Conclusion: 抽象推理原型是LLM泛化推理的基础，ProtoReasoning框架有效提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MinosEval是一种新的开放性问题回答评估方法，通过区分事实性和非事实性问题，采用不同的评分策略，提高了评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估方法（如ROUGE和BERTScore）难以捕捉语义相似性，而现有的基于LLM的方法缺乏直观解释性，且未区分问题类型。

Method: MinosEval首先区分问题类型，对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 实验表明，MinosEval在多个开放性问题回答数据集上更符合人工标注，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过区分问题类型和采用针对性策略，显著提升了开放性问题回答评估的效果。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估语言技术对巴斯克语和西班牙语变体的处理能力，揭示语言变体对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用自然语言推理（NLI）任务，引入手工整理的平行数据集，并通过编码器-解码器大语言模型进行跨语言和上下文学习实验。

Result: 实验显示语言变体（尤其是巴斯克语）导致性能下降，且编码器模型对西巴斯克语处理困难。

Conclusion: 语言变体对模型性能有显著影响，尤其是边缘方言（如西巴斯克语），数据与代码已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Result: Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B模型在关系提取任务中表现最佳（F1=0.68），GraphRAG集成后F1提升11%，有效缓解幻觉现象。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为古典文本知识提取提供低资源解决方案，推动历史知识服务和人文研究。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation

TL;DR: 论文提出Thunder-DeID框架，解决韩国法院判决公开中个人数据去标识化的问题，包括构建首个法律数据集、系统分类PII及开发DNN去标识化流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法院判决的去标识化方法无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律定义模糊，需技术解决方案。

Method: 构建首个韩国法律数据集，系统分类PII，开发DNN去标识化流程。

Result: 模型在去标识化任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了法律与技术需求间的矛盾，提升了去标识化效率。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在关键领域（如临床试验招募）的应用仍有限。LLMs的知识整合和推理能力有望解决传统方法的局限性。

Method: 通过调查分析现有LLM辅助方法，评估其基准、方法和框架，并探讨了挑战与未来方向。

Result: 发现现有方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，需改进以提升LLMs在临床研究中的应用。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床试验招募中具有潜力，但需解决现有挑战并开发更强大的评估框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在语言识别任务中表现不佳，主要由于数据单一（如圣经文本）和类别不平衡问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习领域不变的表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将低资源语言在领域外数据上的LID性能提高了3.2%。

Conclusion: SCL方法能有效提升低资源语言的LID性能，尤其在领域外数据上表现显著。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: 当前临床决策支持中LLMs的评估方法难以区分真实医学推理与表面模式，需更精细的测试框架。

Method: 构建ICU出院记录数据集（真实与合成版本），通过反事实变量（人口统计和生命体征）评估5种LLMs的输入敏感性和下游推理能力。

Result: 零样本模型反事实推理更一致，微调模型更稳定但对临床变化反应较弱；人口统计因素对输出有微妙但持续影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试有助于揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，促进更安全、透明的医疗AI设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 语言模型的全球有效性依赖于对本地社会文化背景的理解，但目前缺乏针对印度文化多样性的评估工具。

Method: SANSKRITI数据集涵盖16个印度文化关键属性，用于测试主流语言模型（LLMs、ILMs、SLMs）的文化理解能力。

Result: 评估显示许多模型在处理文化细微差异和地区特定内容时表现不佳。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Motivation: 印度语言在多模态多语言摘要领域的研究有限，现有数据集多为纯文本或缺乏用户评论。

Method: 构建了包含9种印度语言的COSMMIC数据集，结合文本、图片和用户评论，使用LLama3和GPT-4等模型评估不同配置的效果。

Result: 实验表明，结合文本、评论和图片的配置效果最佳，支持性评论和图像信息的整合提升了摘要质量。

Conclusion: COSMMIC数据集填补了资源空白，推动了印度语言NLP研究，促进了包容性。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在大语言模型中因数据稀缺和预训练不足导致的词汇对齐性能不佳问题。

Method: 采用Low-Rank Adaptation（LoRA）和对比学习目标，针对模型早期层（如第2层）的嵌入进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了623个斯瓦希里语-英语词汇对的词汇对齐能力（平均余弦相似度从0.3211提升至0.4113），并对未见词汇对表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TLI是一种参数高效且有效的方法，能够增强模型在低资源语言中的词汇对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，框架和方法提升了GUI代理的稳健性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为GUI代理的行为提供了可操作的见解，增强了其可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME和HumanEval等任务上表现优异，性能优势随任务难度增加而显著。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2为构建高效、通用的多智能体系统提供了全面解决方案，尤其在复杂推理场景中优势明显。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,

Motivation: 探究LLMs在推理任务中的表现是否源于真实推理能力，还是仅依赖训练数据的统计记忆。

Method: 提出RE-IMAGINE框架，利用中间符号表示生成多样化的推理问题，评估LLMs在不同推理层次的表现。

Conclusion: RE-IMAGINE为评估LLMs的真实推理能力提供了新方法，并揭示了其对统计记忆的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在附加上下文时无法确保生成内容准确性的问题。

Method: 提出CINGS方法，训练时将上下文附加到响应前，仅计算响应标记的损失并屏蔽上下文。

Result: 在11个信息检索数据集上表现优于其他方法，视觉领域减少了幻觉并保持事实一致性。

Conclusion: CINGS通过调整模型对上下文的依赖，显著提升了生成内容的准确性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

TL;DR: SPARE是一种新颖的框架，通过单次标注和参考引导评估，提升LLMs在多步推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效、高质量的自动化过程标注是当前LLMs多步推理能力提升的关键挑战。

Method: SPARE框架通过将每个解决步骤与参考解决方案对齐，并提供明确的评估理由，实现单次标注。

Result: 在数学推理、多跳问答和空间推理任务中，SPARE显著提升了推理性能，且效率更高。

Conclusion: SPARE在提升LLMs推理能力的同时，显著减少了标注时间和计算资源。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架（EmoBi），用于检测文本中的夸张和隐喻，通过情感分析和双向动态交互提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夸张和隐喻在自然语言处理中具有重要意义，但由于其语义模糊和表达多样性，检测难度较大。现有方法多关注表面特征，忽略了情感关联和修辞设备的隐含影响。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，并通过验证机制确保检测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，EmoBi在四个数据集上优于基线方法，F1分数在TroFi数据集上提升了28.1%（夸张检测），在HYPO-L数据集上提升了23.1%（隐喻检测）。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了情感引导和双向动态交互在夸张和隐喻检测中的有效性，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过强化学习和内部推理提升大型语言模型（LLM）的响应可信度，提出了一种基于GRPO方法的训练策略，显著提升了模型在答案正确性、引用充分性和拒绝质量上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成可信且基于证据的响应是LLM的关键挑战，现有方法（如检索增强生成）在简单场景中仍存在失败，如遗漏明确答案、错误引用或拒绝可用证据。

Method: 采用GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）方法，通过可验证的结果奖励（答案正确性、引用充分性、拒绝质量）训练模型，无需昂贵的标注或黄金推理轨迹。实验在多个数据集（ASQA、QAMPARI等）上进行。

Result: 推理增强模型显著优于仅基于指令的变体，尤其在处理不可回答查询和生成引用充分的响应时表现突出。两阶段训练进一步提升了模型的可信度。

Conclusion: 结合推理、阶段优化和结果驱动的强化学习，可以构建更可靠和可验证的LLM。GPT-4蒸馏与GRPO结合进一步提升了长形式生成问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: RATTENTION是一种结合局部注意力和线性注意力的新方法，旨在解决局部注意力忽略窗口外令牌的问题，并在性能和效率之间取得更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决局部注意力完全忽略窗口外令牌的固有局限性，提升在短上下文场景中的效率。

Method: 提出RATTENTION，结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，以捕捉窗口外令牌信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION以512的窗口大小匹配全注意力模型的性能，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RATTENTION在保持训练效率的同时，显著提升了局部-全局注意力模型的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，研究旨在解决从模型权重中近似训练数据的问题。

Method: 开发了一种梯度基方法，从大型公共文本语料库中选择匹配度最高的数据，并通过原始模型和微调模型的权重恢复有用数据。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%，接近专家基准的88%；在MSMARCO文档的SFT模型中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3。

Conclusion: 该方法能从公开数据中有效恢复训练数据，显著提升模型性能，接近专家水平。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: 论文提出Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，通过推测性解码减少LLMs在实时语音聊天中的延迟，提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在实时语音聊天中因生成第一句话的延迟导致用户体验不佳，尤其是在计算资源有限的设备上。

Method: 提出PredGen框架，利用推测性解码在用户仍在说话时生成候选响应，减少TTS系统的等待时间。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验表明，PredGen可将延迟降低约2倍，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen能有效减少LLMs在实时语音应用中的延迟，提升响应速度，适用于资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别区分，缺乏对非二元性别的包容性评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入GIFI指标，从多个层次评估LLMs的性别包容性，包括代词探测、生成行为和认知行为测试。

Result: 评估发现不同LLMs在性别包容性上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLMs性别包容性的重要性，并为未来性别公平性研究提供了基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析器仅适用于单句子描述，无法处理多句子中的跨句子共指现象，导致图解析不完整，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 提出DiscoSG任务，构建数据集DiscoSG-DS，并开发DiscoSG-Refiner模型，通过两个小型PLM分阶段生成和优化场景图。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比基线提升约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，并显著提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner是一种高效且性能优越的多句子场景图解析方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Method: 构建包含1000道多选题的WikiMixQA基准，涵盖7个主题的4000个维基百科页面，评估12种先进视觉语言模型。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但在长文档检索时显著下降；开源模型表现更差，最高准确率仅27%。

Conclusion: WikiMixQA为文档理解研究提供了重要基准，凸显了长上下文多模态推理的挑战。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Result: 模型生成的MCQ质量接近人工编写，但存在语义清晰度和干扰项设计的问题。

Conclusion: 当前模型在葡萄牙语MCQ生成中表现良好，但仍需改进语义清晰度和干扰项设计以满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Result: 成功识别最优后悔表示层和三类功能神经元，发现M形解耦模式。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和指标有效揭示了后悔机制，为模型可靠性研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Result: 文化差异源于字面意义和话语成本权重的结合，而非单纯的语义或礼貌规范。

Conclusion: 跨文化解释差异是字面意义和语用因素复杂互动的结果。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

Motivation: 研究生成式常识推理任务中，LLMs在遵循指定概念顺序时的表现不足，需改进指令遵循和组合泛化能力。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率评估LLMs在指定顺序下的生成能力，并对36种LLMs进行全面分析。

Result: LLMs虽能理解指令意图，但对特定顺序的偏好导致输出多样性低，最优模型的有序覆盖率仅75%。

Conclusion: 现有LLMs在指令遵循和组合泛化能力上仍需改进，Ordered CommonGen为未来研究提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Method: 使用ROST语料库，系统评估了SVM、LR、k-NN、DT、RF和ANN六种方法，采用字符n-gram特征进行分类。

Result: ANN模型表现最佳，使用5-gram特征时在15次运行中有4次实现完美分类。

Conclusion: 轻量级字符n-gram方法在罗马尼亚语作者归属任务中可以达到先进水平，适用于资源受限或研究较少的语言环境。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

TL;DR: CC-Learn通过强化学习框架提升LLM推理的可靠性，利用同类问题训练模型，显著提高了准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中仍存在一致性和鲁棒性问题，需要改进。

Method: 采用基于同类问题的强化学习框架（CC-Learn），结合准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚的复合目标进行优化。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提升了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: CC-Learn通过同类强化学习有效提升了LLM的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型的推理痕迹中存在隐私泄露风险，即使推理痕迹被视为内部数据，仍可能通过提示注入或意外泄露敏感信息。增加推理步骤会放大这种泄露，揭示了推理能力提升与隐私攻击面扩大之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型作为个人代理时，其推理痕迹中潜在的隐私泄露问题，挑战了推理痕迹被视为内部安全的假设。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，分析推理痕迹中的敏感数据泄露情况，并研究测试时计算（如增加推理步骤）对泄露的影响。

Result: 增加推理步骤虽然使模型在最终答案中更谨慎，但也导致推理痕迹更详细，从而泄露更多隐私信息。

Conclusion: 隐私保护需扩展到模型的内部推理过程，而不仅是最终输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Motivation: 研究性别包容性机器翻译的重要性，以避免性别错误和代表性伤害，尤其是在语法性别语言中保持性别模糊的挑战。

Method: 评估21种机器翻译系统在三种不同难度的翻译方向中对性别模糊的敏感度，并分类观察到的性别中立策略。

Result: 大多数系统未能提供性别中立翻译，仅少数系统根据目标语言采用特定策略实现性别中立。

Conclusion: 机器翻译系统在性别中立翻译方面表现不佳，但部分系统展示了可行的策略，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

TL;DR: GenRecal是一个通用的视觉语言模型蒸馏框架，通过特征对齐实现跨架构知识迁移，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限设备上部署大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）的挑战，以及跨不同架构VLMs知识迁移的难题。

Method: 提出Generation after Recalibration（GenRecal）框架，包含Recalibrator模块，用于对齐异构VLMs的特征表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GenRecal显著超越基线性能，甚至优于大型开源和闭源VLMs。

Conclusion: GenRecal为跨架构VLMs知识蒸馏提供了一种有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，错误信息生产和学术不端等社会问题加剧，现有检测器对私有调优LLM生成的文本检测效果不佳，亟需新方法。

Method: 提出PhantomHunter，采用家族感知学习框架，捕获基础模型及其衍生模型的家族级特征，而非记忆个体特征。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验显示，PhantomHunter优于7个基线方法和3个工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter能有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，为LLM生成文本检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark

integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based

highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Conclusion: ViLLa通过模块化设计实现了透明性和可解释性，为动物监测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Conclusion: GraphGSOcc有效提升3D语义占用预测性能，兼顾语义和几何信息。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to

Conclusion: 可解释的检测方法为AI生成视频的可靠识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

challenge in monocular 3D detection. While DETR-like architectures offer a
powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent
limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these
challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally
advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.
First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the
integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves
the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization
objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to
address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which
severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly
introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and
unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated
self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to
synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the
iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular
benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components
seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant
performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes
dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities.

### [62] [Improved Iterative Refinement for Chart-to-Code Generation via Structured Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14837)
*Chengzhi Xu,Yuyang Wang,Lai Wei,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构化指令的迭代优化方法ChartIR，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图表到代码生成任务中的表现。通过将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两个部分，并设计描述和差异两种结构化指令，显著提升了生成代码的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在图表到代码生成任务中表现不佳，主要因缺乏对视觉元素的精确理解和结构化代码翻译能力。直接提示MLLMs完成此复杂任务效果不理想。

Method: 提出ChartIR方法，将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分，设计描述和差异两种结构化指令，并采用初始代码生成和迭代优化的两阶段流程。

Result: 实验表明，ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ChartIR通过结构化指令和迭代优化有效提升了MLLMs在图表到代码生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

Result: 实验表明，嵌入模型的预训练方式显著影响训练成功率和跨域性能，PictSure在跨域任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PictSure通过优化嵌入模型设计，提升了少样本图像分类的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数学和实证的框架BKSEF，用于优化CNN中逐层核大小选择，平衡信息增益、计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核大小选择对CNN的感知野、特征提取、计算成本和模型准确性至关重要，但常被忽视。

Method: 结合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，提出BKSEF框架，通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，BKSEF引导的架构比传统模型提升3.1%准确率并减少42.8%计算量。

Conclusion: BKSEF证明核大小是可优化的参数，为高效和应用感知的CNN设计提供理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，显著减少人工标注成本并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖耗时的人工标注，成本高且效率低，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧特征，结合零售环境定制的目标检测技术，实现关键帧自动识别与标注。

Result: 方法准确性接近人工标注，平均节省2倍成本，仅需人工验证5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且经济，适用于零售领域的多种应用，如顾客行为分析和产品交互检测。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中如何选择最具信息量的视角以减少冗余计算并提高效率的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级神经网络UPNet预测视角不确定性，结合启发式方法选择最优视角，训练3D神经渲染模型。

Result: 仅用一半视角即达到与上限相当的精度，计算速度提升400倍，资源消耗减少50%以上。

Conclusion: UPNet方法在高效性和泛化性上表现优异，适用于新物体类别且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Abstract: Alignment is crucial for text-to-image (T2I) models to ensure that generated
images faithfully capture user intent while maintaining safety and fairness.
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models
(LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces
DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three
dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with
traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized
Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet
kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe
and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's
default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and
R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce
DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately
100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE
encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and
Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images
generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable
Diffusion XL, and Midjourney. Additionally, we propose the Alignment Quality
Index (AQI), a novel geometric measure quantifying latent-space separability of
safe/unsafe image activations, revealing hidden vulnerabilities. Empirically,
we demonstrate that DPO-Kernels maintain strong generalization bounds via
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR). DETONATE and complete code are

Conclusion: PeRL在多图像任务中表现优异，同时保持单图像任务的性能，验证了其通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在医学图像生成中的隐私风险日益突出，现有MIA方法依赖重建误差，但受图像固有难度和高频细节重建困难的影响。

Method: 通过分析逆向扩散过程，计算中频范围的重建误差，并结合结构相似性指数评分，排除高频和低频区域的干扰。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像MIA中的挑战，为隐私风险评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and
challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics
searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep
learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet
tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer
(ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information,
remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially
under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a
systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet
classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel
jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and
reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our
comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably
ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN
baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of
capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work
establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for
applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using
public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep
learning research in this domain.

Abstract: Compliance is a critical parameter for describing objects in engineering,
agriculture, and biomedical applications. Traditional compliance detection
methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on
specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic
applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using
vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent
Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB
tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor
GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance
of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in
accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant
performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the
correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which
revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to
estimate.

Motivation: 历史地图中的文本包含丰富的地理、历史和文化信息，但由于缺乏有效方法和训练数据，提取这些文本具有挑战性。

Method: PALETTE引入超局部采样模块学习目标边界点和字符的局部特征，并结合超局部位置嵌入学习空间交互。同时，提出SynthMap+自动生成合成地图数据用于训练。

Conclusion: PALETTE结合SynthMap+为历史地图文本提取提供了高效解决方案，支持大规模地图搜索和分析。

Abstract: Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced
historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from
historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)
training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific
map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene
images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their
flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these
methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting
every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This
is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex
backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a
rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for
scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel
hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around
the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and
recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn
spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across
text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to
automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text
spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+
outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical
maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with
SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map
collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

TL;DR: StyleWallfacer是一个统一的训练和推理框架，解决了传统风格迁移方法的问题，并支持艺术家级风格迁移和文本驱动风格化。通过语义风格注入、数据增强策略和无训练的三重扩散过程，实现了高质量的风格迁移和文本控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风格迁移方法存在多种问题，如风格注入不精准、内容漂移等。StyleWallfacer旨在通过统一框架解决这些问题，并支持更灵活的风格迁移任务。

Method: 1. 基于语义的风格注入方法，利用BLIP生成与风格图像语义对齐的文本描述，并通过大语言模型移除风格相关描述以创建语义差距。2. 基于人类反馈的数据增强策略，逐步优化训练集。3. 无训练的三重扩散过程，通过替换自注意力层的键和值实现风格注入。

Result: 实现了高质量的风格迁移和文本驱动风格化，同时保留了原始图像内容，并首次在风格迁移过程中实现了图像颜色编辑。

Conclusion: StyleWallfacer通过创新的方法解决了传统风格迁移的局限性，为艺术家级风格迁移和文本控制提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: In this pioneering study, we introduce StyleWallfacer, a groundbreaking
unified training and inference framework, which not only addresses various
issues encountered in the style transfer process of traditional methods but
also unifies the framework for different tasks. This framework is designed to
revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven
stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that
uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of
the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove
style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.
This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free
injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy
based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in
the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive
learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a
training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which
manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the
cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and
value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the
style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the
model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the
original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality
image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering
artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image
content. Moreover, we achieve image color editing during the style transfer
process for the first time.

Conclusion: 理论和实证分析验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: SynPo是一种基于大型视觉模型（如SAM）的无训练少样本医学图像分割方法，通过改进负提示质量提升低对比度图像的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LVMs的无训练方法未能有效利用负提示，导致在低对比度医学图像上表现不佳。

Method: 设计置信图协同模块结合DINOv2和SAM，选择高质量正负点提示，通过K-means聚类后输入SAM进行分割。

Result: 实验表明SynPo性能接近基于训练的最先进少样本方法。

Conclusion: SynPo通过优化提示选择，显著提升了无训练方法在医学图像分割中的表现。

Abstract: The advent of Large Vision Models (LVMs) offers new opportunities for
few-shot medical image segmentation. However, existing training-free methods
based on LVMs fail to effectively utilize negative prompts, leading to poor
performance on low-contrast medical images. To address this issue, we propose
SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core
insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in
a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module
by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we
select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative
points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means
clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as
high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在聚合局部结构时存在无关点干扰和特征层次差距问题，且基于几何结构编码的方法计算开销大、对噪声敏感。

Method: PDSA模块利用高维空间相关性校正特征分布，通过轻量级跨阶段结构描述符区分点相关性，并通过减少邻居特征矩阵方差和长距离建模增强结构同质性。

Result: 在语义分割和分类任务中验证了方法的泛化性，性能显著提升且参数成本更低。

Conclusion: PDSA模块有效解决了点云分析中的问题，实验和可视化结果验证了其合理性和有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis is the cornerstone of many downstream tasks, among which
aggregating local structures is the basis for understanding point cloud data.
While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative
coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap
problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works
address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit
modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct
geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and
noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point
Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the
high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,
which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes
the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,
and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor
feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance
modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the
computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and
classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of
the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with
less parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results
demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method. The code and

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上表现优异，Dice分数分别达到0.962和0.939。

Conclusion: Echo-DND为超声图像分割设立了新标准，并有望推广至其他医学影像任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have
revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical
applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in
echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.
However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and
ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise
diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a
unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a
multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.
Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial
integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously
validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It
achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.
The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram
segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in
other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across
various medical domains. Project page: https://abdur75648.github.io/Echo-DND

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术只能解决视觉搜索中的检索或定位问题，无法同时满足需求，ReSeDis旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入ReSeDis任务，结合检索与定位，设计专用评测指标，并提供零样本基线模型。

Result: ReSeDis为多模态搜索系统提供了端到端的测试平台，展示了未来研究的潜力。

Conclusion: ReSeDis为构建下一代鲁棒且可扩展的多模态搜索系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large-scale visual search engines are expected to solve a dual problem at
once: (i) locate every image that truly contains the object described by a
sentence and (ii) identify the object's bounding box or exact pixels within
each hit. Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual
grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption
that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false
alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at
sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at
whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce
Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies
corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form
description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in
each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation
masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every
description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse
corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific
metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.
Finally, we provide a straightforward zero-shot baseline using a frozen
vision-language model, revealing significant headroom for future study. ReSeDis
offers a realistic, end-to-end testbed for building the next generation of
robust and scalable multimodal search systems.

Conclusion: VICL在OCT领域具有潜力，但仍存在局限，公开代码以促进研究与应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical image analysis have led to the development of
highly specialized models tailored to specific clinical tasks. These models
have demonstrated exceptional performance and remain a crucial research
direction. Yet, their applicability is limited to predefined tasks, requiring
expertise and extensive resources for development and adaptation. In contrast,
generalist models offer a different form of utility: allowing medical
practitioners to define tasks on the fly without the need for task-specific
model development. In this work, we explore how to train generalist models for
the domain of retinal optical coherence tomography using visual in-context
learning (VICL), i.e., training models to generalize across tasks based on a
few examples provided at inference time. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we
propose a broad evaluation protocol tailored to VICL in OCT. We extensively
evaluate a state-of-the-art medical VICL approach on multiple retinal OCT
datasets, establishing a first baseline to highlight the potential and current
limitations of in-context learning for OCT. To foster further research and
practical adoption, we openly release our code.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言预训练模型语义理解能力的提升，公开图像容易被搜索引擎等工具利用，本文旨在通过图像压缩阶段的防御措施保护用户隐私。

Method: 提出PSIC方法，生成具有多解码选项的比特流，默认解码保留感知质量但阻止VLP模型解释；引入CLTG模块和UAEO优化函数，结合自适应多目标优化策略。

Result: 实验证明PSIC在多种下游任务中有效，既能保护隐私，又能保持图像压缩功能。

Conclusion: PSIC是一种即插即用的方法，可无缝集成到现有LIC模型中，同时提升加密性能和感知质量。

Abstract: The improved semantic understanding of vision-language pretrained (VLP)
models has made it increasingly difficult to protect publicly posted images
from being exploited by search engines and other similar tools. In this
context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at
the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a
flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that
can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the
bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while
preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original
image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the
proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic
information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed
to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the
decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an
Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed
to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on
the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective
optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual
quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme
is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned
Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple
downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.

Motivation: 现有MMIF方法在捕捉细节特征和跨模态交互方面存在不足，导致融合图像质量不理想。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段通过UNet进行图像重建，捕捉细节信息；第二阶段将噪声图像输入融合网络，增强特征识别能力，并结合三种关键融合模块自适应处理不同模态图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在客观评价指标上表现优异，融合图像保留了适当的亮度、放射性示踪剂分布、丰富纹理和清晰边缘。

Conclusion: DM-FNet通过两阶段扩散模型和混合损失函数，显著提升了医学图像融合的质量和信息密度。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful
information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and
accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful
balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused
images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the
functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited
capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer
from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused
image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage
diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In
Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet
captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents
multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the
subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input
into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.
Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from
different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a
hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,
color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The
experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the
proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation
metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive
distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables submeter-resolution imaging and
all-weather monitoring via active microwave and advanced signal processing.
Currently, SAR has found extensive applications in critical maritime domains
such as ship detection. However, SAR ship detection faces several challenges,
including significant scale variations among ships, the presence of small
offshore vessels mixed with noise, and complex backgrounds for large nearshore
ships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement
and fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN. C-AFBiFPN constructs a Convolutional
Feature Enhancement (CFE) module following the backbone network, aiming to
enrich feature representation and enhance the ability to capture and represent
local details and contextual information. Furthermore, C-AFBiFPN innovatively
integrates BiFormer attention within the fusion strategy of BiFPN, creating the
AFBiFPN network. AFBiFPN improves the global modeling capability of cross-scale

experimental results on SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD) indicate that the
proposed approach substantially enhances detection accuracy for small targets,
robustness against occlusions, and adaptability to multi-scale features.

Conclusion: RA-NeRF在复杂相机轨迹下表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为3D重建和SLAM任务提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have emerged
as powerful tools for 3D reconstruction and SLAM tasks. However, their
performance depends heavily on accurate camera pose priors. Existing approaches
attempt to address this issue by introducing external constraints but fall
short of achieving satisfactory accuracy, particularly when camera trajectories
are complex. In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of
predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories.
Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF
with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to
enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally,
RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern
and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct
extensive experiments on the Tanks\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as
well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose
trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in
both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness
and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories.

Motivation: 现有COD方法缺乏历史上下文机制，限制了其在复杂伪装场景中的适应性和有效性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RetroMem显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: RetroMem通过动态记忆机制和多尺度适配器，有效提升了伪装对象检测的性能。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily focuses on learning subtle yet
discriminative representations from complex scenes. Existing methods
predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static
visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for
acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in
handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a
recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates
camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical
knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training
paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,
update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning
stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained
encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very
few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the
recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference
pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent
relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to
reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly
improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments
on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world

Method: 提出多尺度特征融合框架MSNeRV，包括时间窗口增强时间一致性、GoP级网格背景表示、多尺度空间解码器和自适应损失函数，以及多尺度特征块。

Result: 在HEVC ClassB和UVG数据集上，MSNeRV在表示能力和压缩效率上优于现有INR方法，并超越VTM-23.7（随机访问）。

Conclusion: MSNeRV通过多尺度特征融合和视频特定设计，显著提升了神经视频表示和压缩性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach
for video compression, and have achieved comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art codecs such as H.266/VVC. However, existing INR-based methods
struggle to effectively represent detail-intensive and fast-changing video
content. This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal
network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network
design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion
framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we
enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the
video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used
for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial
decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and
multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we
introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We
evaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and
compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior
representation capability among INR-based approaches and surpasses VTM-23.7
(Random Access) in dynamic scenarios in terms of compression efficiency.

Abstract: Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant
challenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented
reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on
2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical
navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise
detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this
paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that
significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery
primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a
Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture
semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization
(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for
reliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve
Refinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a
multi-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale
pixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations

TL;DR: ViMAT是一种无需标记或固定工作空间设置的AI驱动系统，用于实时监控工业装配任务，通过多视角视频流和推理模块实现高效监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业装配任务的视觉监控对防止设备损坏和确保工人安全至关重要，但现有商业解决方案通常需要标记或固定设置，限制了灵活性。

Method: ViMAT结合感知模块（从多视角视频流提取视觉观察）和推理模块（基于观察状态和任务知识推断最可能的动作）。

Result: 在LEGO组件更换和液压模具重组任务中验证了ViMAT的有效性，定量和定性分析表明其在部分和不确定观察下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ViMAT在无需标记或固定设置的复杂场景中表现出色，为工业装配监控提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual monitoring of industrial assembly tasks is critical for preventing
equipment damage due to procedural errors and ensuring worker safety. Although
commercial solutions exist, they typically require rigid workspace setups or
the application of visual markers to simplify the problem. We introduce ViMAT,
a novel AI-driven system for real-time visual monitoring of assembly tasks that
operates without these constraints. ViMAT combines a perception module that
extracts visual observations from multi-view video streams with a reasoning
module that infers the most likely action being performed based on the observed
assembly state and prior task knowledge. We validate ViMAT on two assembly
tasks, involving the replacement of LEGO components and the reconfiguration of
hydraulic press molds, demonstrating its effectiveness through quantitative and
qualitative analysis in challenging real-world scenarios characterized by
partial and uncertain visual observations. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了面部微表情（MEs）的识别、检测与生成，提出了结合检测与识别的统一任务ME-STR，以及利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的ME-VQA任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将微表情检测与识别分开处理，在真实场景中效果不佳，而多模态大语言模型的出现为ME分析提供了新思路。

Method: 提出ME-STR任务（统一检测与识别）和ME-VQA任务（利用MLLMs进行视觉问答）。

Result: MEGC 2025挑战赛将评估这些新方法在测试集上的表现。

Conclusion: 结合多模态大语言模型和统一任务框架有望提升微表情分析的性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that
occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to
suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes
environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the
areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional
approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are
suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic
settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues
for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that
reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize
(ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified
sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which
explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs
or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating
algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a
leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Conclusion: MapFM通过多任务学习和基础模型结合，有效提升了在线矢量高精地图生成的准确性和质量。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, high-definition (HD) maps and semantic maps in
bird's-eye view (BEV) are essential for accurate localization, planning, and
decision-making. This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM
for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature
representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding
camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment
and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for
semantic segmentation in the BEV representation. This multi-task learning
approach provides richer contextual supervision, leading to a more
comprehensive scene representation and ultimately resulting in higher accuracy
and improved quality of the predicted vectorized HD maps. The source code is

### [92] [OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15318)
*Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Shichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenPath提出了一种基于预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）的开集主动学习方法，用于病理图像分类，通过任务特定提示和多样性信息采样策略，显著提高了标注效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像分类需要大规模标注数据，但获取成本高。传统主动学习方法在开集场景（含大量OOD数据）中效率低下，且初始随机选择浪费标注资源。

Method: OpenPath结合任务特定提示（首轮查询）和多样性信息ID采样（DIS，后续查询），包括原型ID候选选择（PIS）和熵引导随机采样（EGSS），避免选择OOD样本。

Result: 在两个公共病理图像数据集上，OpenPath显著提升模型性能，优于现有开集主动学习方法。

Conclusion: OpenPath通过高效样本选择和避免OOD数据，显著提升了病理图像分类的标注效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical
diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this
task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both
expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution
by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby
reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the
assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to
target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often
contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low
efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing
AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a
significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for
pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine
target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select
In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In
subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes
Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic
Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a
query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public
pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's
performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art open-set AL methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新任务：视频中的开放世界物体计数，通过文本或图像指定目标物体，统计视频中所有独特实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决拥挤场景中因遮挡和相似物体导致的重复计数和重新识别问题。

Method: 提出CountVid模型，结合基于图像的计数模型和可提示的视频分割与跟踪模型。

Result: 在VideoCount数据集上验证，CountVid表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CountVid和VideoCount数据集为开放世界物体计数提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何感知的纹理映射方法，用于解决动物皮毛或皮肤图案因身体运动和姿态变化导致的几何变形问题，提升了重新识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动物皮毛或皮肤图案的几何变形问题，尤其是在身体运动和姿态变化时。

Method: 采用几何感知的纹理映射方法，将皮毛图案映射到规范的UV空间，利用表面法线估计指导映射过程，保持几何一致性。

Result: 在Saimaa环斑海豹和豹子的数据集上，重新识别准确率提升了5.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需标注真实UV数据，支持自监督训练，显著提升了复杂姿态和视角下的重新识别性能。

Abstract: Existing individual re-identification methods often struggle with the
deformable nature of animal fur or skin patterns which undergo geometric
distortions due to body movement and posture changes. In this paper, we propose
a geometry-aware texture mapping approach that unwarps pelage patterns, the
unique markings found on an animal's skin or fur, into a canonical UV space,
enabling more robust feature matching. Our method uses surface normal
estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric
consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two
challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards
(Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur
patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing
re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse
poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV
annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal
and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDIS是一种基于扩散模型的数据无关图像合成方法，通过引入领域对齐指导和类对齐标记，显著提升了合成图像的质量和与训练数据分布的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源预训练模型的应用潜力巨大，但训练数据不可用时其效用下降。现有数据无关图像合成方法因缺乏自然图像先验知识，生成的样本偏离训练数据分布。

Method: DDIS利用文本到图像扩散模型作为图像先验，通过领域对齐指导（DAG）和类对齐标记（CAT）嵌入，优化合成图像与训练数据分布的对齐。

Result: 在PACS和ImageNet上的实验表明，DDIS优于现有方法，生成更符合训练数据分布的样本，在数据无关应用中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DDIS通过结合扩散模型和领域对齐技术，有效解决了数据无关图像合成中的分布偏差问题，为相关应用提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Open-source pre-trained models hold great potential for diverse applications,
but their utility declines when their training data is unavailable. Data-Free
Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned
data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.
However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training
data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To
overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted
Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model
as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts
knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to
guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately
align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain
Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the
training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we
optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture
class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima
geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating
samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA
performance in data-free applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为NERO的新型OOD评分机制，通过利用特征层的神经元级相关性来增强OOD样本的检测能力，并在胃肠道影像基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，模型可靠性至关重要，而OOD样本检测是衡量可靠性的重要指标。现有方法可能无法完全捕捉OOD多样性，因此需要更有效的检测机制。

Method: 提出NERO方法，通过聚类神经元级相关性形成代表性中心，并引入相关性距离度量新样本与中心的偏差。同时结合缩放相关性和特征范数优化性能。

Result: 在胃肠道影像基准测试Kvasir和GastroVision上，NERO优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性和距离度量显著提升了OOD检测能力，同时支持可解释性检测。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

Conclusion: GenHOI通过两阶段设计有效解决了4D HOI合成的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

Motivation: LGE心脏MRI图像的高质量瘢痕标签有限且多变，限制了稳健分割模型的发展。

Method: 提出CLAIM框架，包含SMILE模块（基于临床知识的瘢痕掩模生成）和联合训练策略，生成解剖学一致的瘢痕图像并优化分割网络。

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

Conclusion: RaCalNet展示了稀疏监督在深度估计中的潜力，性能优于密集监督方法，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Dense metric depth estimation using millimeter-wave radar typically requires
dense LiDAR supervision, generated via multi-frame projection and
interpolation, to guide the learning of accurate depth from sparse radar
measurements and RGB images. However, this paradigm is both costly and
data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that
eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise
the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density
of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous
approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely
heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar
points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable
anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation
without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural
consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse
supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods,

TL;DR: WinWinLay提出了一种无需训练的布局到图像生成方法，通过非局部注意力能量函数和自适应更新策略，解决了现有方法在定位不准和伪影问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型的方法在布局控制上存在定位不准和伪影问题，WinWinLay旨在解决这些问题。

Method: WinWinLay采用非局部注意力能量函数和基于Langevin动力学的自适应更新策略，优化空间分布偏差和更新规则。

Result: 实验表明，WinWinLay在元素布局控制和视觉逼真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WinWinLay通过理论创新和实验验证，显著提升了布局到图像生成的精确性和真实性。

Abstract: Layout-to-Image generation aims to create complex scenes with precise control
over the placement and arrangement of subjects. Existing works have
demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this
goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges
with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these
drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core,
WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and
Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On
one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy
function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects
from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue,
non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores,
facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On
the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can
cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution
artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update
scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout
constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in
controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods.

3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are
constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling
scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective
multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model,
autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language
head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类面临像素级标注成本高、尺度变化大和大规模视觉模型适应性有限等挑战。

Method: 采用半监督分割框架，结合SAM2知识和FreqWeaver Adapter，仅占模型总参数的5.96%。

Result: 在结构一致性方面表现优异，比现有参数高效调优策略提升1.78%，比最先进高分辨率遥感分割方法提升3.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用未标注数据和保持低参数开销，实现了鲁棒的分割效果。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

*Di Wang,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新型统一框架，用于大规模点云的端到端处理，显著提升了森林地上生物量（AGB）估计的可行性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前定量结构模型（QSM）方法在个体树依赖、高质量点云数据需求和多预处理步骤方面存在局限性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过创新的基于图的流程，无缝集成树分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建，利用路径和抽象等图操作进行树拓扑推理。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶覆盖、数据源）验证表现优异，叶覆盖场景相对误差约20%，低密度无人机激光扫描（ULS）数据集约30%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模非破坏性AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，减少了对专业预处理工具的依赖，并确立了ULS作为TLS的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DLoRAL的双LoRA学习范式，用于在视频超分辨率任务中同时实现丰富的空间细节和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的Real-VSR方法通常在空间细节和时序一致性之间妥协，导致视觉质量不佳。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过交叉帧检索（CFR）模块和一致性LoRA（C-LoRA）学习时序表示，再通过细节LoRA（D-LoRA）增强空间细节，两者交替优化。

Result: DLoRAL在精度和速度上均表现出色，能够高效实现高质量视频恢复。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习范式，成功实现了视频超分辨率任务中细节丰富和时序一致性的平衡。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为M2M-Reg的新框架，用于解决多模态图像配准中因模态差异大导致的配准困难问题，通过单模态相似性训练模型并引入GradCyCon正则化器，显著提升了配准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中，功能成像（如PET、FA）常需与结构成像（如MRI、CT）配准，但传统无监督配准方法因模态差异大而效果不佳。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练多模态配准模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚。支持半监督设置，无需真实变换或分割掩码。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中的DSC指标比现有方法提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg能有效处理高度异质的多模态配准问题，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建的在线3D物体检测框架，结合预训练视觉基础模型和CLIP，实现高效实时检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检测方法依赖密集点云重建，计算和内存开销大，难以实时部署。

Method: 利用Cubify Anything和CLIP进行单视图检测，通过关联和优化模块融合多视图检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上表现优异，支持实时感知。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重建，计算高效，适用于大场景实时检测。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

TL;DR: HOIDiNi是一个基于文本驱动的扩散框架，用于生成真实且合理的人-物交互（HOI），通过优化噪声空间实现高接触精度和自然运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在真实性和物理正确性之间难以平衡，HOIDiNi旨在同时实现两者。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：对象中心阶段选择手-物接触位置，人体中心阶段优化全身运动。使用扩散噪声优化（DNO）直接优化预训练扩散模型的噪声空间。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上，HOIDiNi在接触精度、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够生成复杂且可控的交互动作，仅通过文本驱动。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理长期记忆和大量图像数据时表现不足，且缺乏针对机器人控制任务的评估基准。

Result: 基准测试展示了现有模型在长期记忆任务中的局限性，并指出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为评估和改进视觉语言模型在机器人控制任务中的长期记忆能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与性能之间存在矛盾，图像质量偏离人类感知时反而可能提升模型表现。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以优化任务性能。

Motivation: 探讨视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，揭示其与人类感知的差异，并解决现有修复方法无法满足模型特定需求的问题。

Method: 提出VQ-TTT模块，通过可学习的低秩核调整频率内容，并仅微调浅层视觉编码器，动态优化输入图像。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了MLLMs在所有数据集上的平均准确率，无需外部模型或额外数据。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs的“更好”视觉输入标准，强调需要自适应而非通用的“干净”图像。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型推理方法计算成本高且易产生低置信度生成，导致幻觉问题。ViMaR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ViMaR分为两阶段：首阶段筛选最高价值候选描述；次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分，并引入边缘惩罚机制。

Conclusion: ViMaR具有高效、可扩展和跨模型泛化能力，为视觉语言模型推理提供了一种快速、准确且自我改进的策略。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Motivation: 解决非侵入式EEG在开放词汇场景下的噪声和变异性问题，突破传统方法在小封闭词汇上的局限。

Method: 整合EEG与同步眼动数据，实现开放词汇文本生成和情感分类。

Result: 在BLEU和Rouge得分上表现优异，情感分类F1得分提升10%，支持多被试和多源数据。

Conclusion: ETS框架在开放词汇EEG到文本任务中展现出高性能潜力。

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Assembly-of-Experts”（AoE）的新方法，用于高效创建混合专家模型的子模型，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练中计算8位权重的成本极高（10^13-10^15 FLOPs），效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的方法来利用预训练模型的资源。

Method: 通过线性时间内的权重张量插值，AoE方法可以增强或抑制父模型的语义特征，生成功能强大的子模型。

Result: 生成的DeepSeek R1T“Chimera”模型继承了父模型的专家张量，性能接近R1水平，但输出令牌减少40%，推理更紧凑有序。

Conclusion: AoE方法能够高效生成功能强大的子模型，无需微调或蒸馏，为模型空间探索提供了简单直接的途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

Motivation: 探索强化学习（RL）在大语言模型（LLM）推理中的广泛适用性，解决跨领域可靠奖励信号的挑战。

Method: 通过领域特定的奖励设计、去重和过滤构建Guru语料库，并基于此系统研究RL对LLM推理的影响。

Result: 发现RL在不同领域的表现差异显著，并推出Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型，在公开数据训练的模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RL能促进真实技能获取，特别是在预训练数据较少的领域，Guru为通用推理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

### [120] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Motivation: 探讨上下文学习在标签缺失或错误时的表现，并揭示其背后的机制。

Method: 使用二元高斯混合模型（GMM）生成演示数据，分析单层线性注意力模型和多层/循环Transformer的表现。

Result: 多层或循环Transformer能通过隐式构造多项式有效利用未标记数据，且其性能随深度指数增长。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，显著提升了半监督表格学习的性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

TL;DR: PRISM框架解决了现有特征描述方法的局限性，通过捕捉神经网络特征的复杂性，提供更准确和丰富的描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设神经元仅编码单一概念（单义性），但实际中神经元常为多义性，导致描述不准确。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，为多义性和单义性特征提供更细致的描述。

Result: PRISM在语言模型中表现优于现有方法，提高了描述质量和多义性捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更复杂的特征描述方法，显著提升了模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的方法LoX，通过外推安全子空间增强LLM的安全性，显著降低微调攻击的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的广泛使用引发安全问题，即使对齐后的模型在微调时也可能被破坏安全性。

Method: 基于安全关键低秩子空间的敏感性，提出LoX方法，外推对齐LLM的安全子空间。

Result: LoX显著提升了安全性，面对良性或恶意微调攻击，攻击成功率降低11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移至平坦区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，有效增强LLM的安全鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工设计规则，AutoRule旨在实现完全自动化。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集，并用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 使用AutoRule训练的Llama-3-8B模型在AlpacaEval2.0上相对提升28.6%，在MT-Bench子集上提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule减少了奖励滥用，提取的规则能捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 现有方法多关注文本数据，而忽略了视觉数据中的物理信息（如卫星图像的时空背景），导致预测效果受限。

Method: PIPE方法包含两部分创新：(1) 物理信息位置索引方案，将物理信息映射为位置ID；(2) 变频率位置编码机制，编码物理变量频率和序列顺序。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最优性能，台风强度预测提升12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过嵌入物理信息显著提升了多模态对齐和预测准确性，为多模态时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 研究稀疏自编码器中密集潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，以验证其是否为训练噪声或具有实际意义。

Method: 系统分析密集潜在特征的几何结构、功能和起源，包括其形成抗对偶对、对残差流中特定方向的重建作用，以及在不同层中的演化。

Result: 密集潜在特征具有功能性作用，如位置跟踪、上下文绑定、熵调节等，并在模型不同层中表现出从结构到语义再到输出信号的演化。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算中的功能性组成部分，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

Motivation: 尽管大型模型在推理能力上有显著进步，但视觉语言模型在详细视觉推理方面仍存在困难，尤其是在计算资源有限时。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）训练小规模模型，结合简单奖励结构、简化工具调用接口、为工具调用结果分配额外令牌，以及侧重视觉难度高的训练数据。

Result: 在部分视觉问答任务中，该方法优于类似规模的基线模型，得益于从外部工具获取的详细视觉信息。

Conclusion: 通过GRPO和外部工具的结合，小规模视觉语言模型在资源受限环境下实现了更好的详细视觉推理性能。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法对输入扰动高度敏感，影响了其可信度，因此需要一种能够提供严格鲁棒性保证的方法。

Method: 通过稀疏化和平滑化归因图，将其重新表述为分割问题，并利用随机平滑技术对每个像素的重要性进行认证。

Result: 在12种归因方法和5个ImageNet模型上的广泛评估表明，该方法生成的认证归因具有鲁棒性、可解释性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为归因方法提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如上下文缓存和语义缓存）主要针对聊天机器人设计，无法满足依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用需求。

Method: 从已完成代理执行中提取计划模板，使用关键词匹配新请求，并通过轻量级模型将模板适配到具体任务。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，平均降低成本46.62%，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于LLM的代理应用提供了高效且兼容现有基础设施的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that

### [131] [Hypothesis Testing for Quantifying LLM-Human Misalignment in Multiple Choice Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14997)
*Harbin Hong,Sebastian Caldas,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种定量框架，通过假设检验评估大语言模型（LLM）在多项选择调查中模拟人类行为的偏差，发现其在争议性问题上的模拟效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会科学研究中的应用增多，评估其模拟人类行为的准确性变得至关重要。

Method: 使用假设检验的定量框架，评估LLM在多项选择调查中模拟人类行为的偏差。

Result: 发现流行语言模型在争议性问题上的模拟效果不佳，尤其是在不同种族、年龄和收入的子群体中。

Conclusion: 该模型与测试人群的对齐性存在问题，需改进LLM在社会科学研究中的应用方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于OCR的语音合成系统，帮助视障人士通过声音获取书籍内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视障人士通常依赖盲文书籍和音频录音，但这些方式限制了他们的选择。语音是一种更有效的沟通方式。

Method: 使用LabVIEW实现OCR技术，开发了准确、可靠、经济且用户友好的语音合成系统。

Result: 系统能够将文本转换为语音，帮助视障人士更便捷地获取书籍内容。

Conclusion: OCR语音合成系统为视障人士提供了更灵活的阅读选择，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

TL;DR: SonicVerse是一个多任务音乐描述模型，结合了描述生成与辅助音乐特征检测任务，通过投影架构将音频输入转化为语言标记，提升描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 丰富音乐数据库并推动音乐AI研究，通过生成准确反映音乐特征的详细描述。

Method: 采用多任务框架，结合描述生成与音乐特征检测（如调性检测、人声检测等），通过投影架构将音频和特征转化为语言标记。

Result: 实验表明，结合音乐特征提升了生成描述的细节和质量。

Conclusion: SonicVerse能生成丰富描述，并支持长音乐片段的时间信息描述，为音乐AI研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种基于被动声学监测的野生动物研究方法，利用自动化录音设备（ARUs）收集数据，并通过pycnet-audio工具进行自动化处理，以检测目标物种的声信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动处理大规模声学数据效率低下，需要一种自动化方法来高效分析ARUs收集的海量录音数据。

Method: 使用pycnet-audio工具，基于PNW-Cnet模型，自动检测约80种森林野生动物及环境噪声的声信号。

Result: PNW-Cnet模型已成功扩展用于多种物种和噪声的检测，支持高效的声学数据分析。

Conclusion: pycnet-audio提供了一种实用的声学数据处理流程，显著提升了大规模声学监测项目的效率。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the
U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls
(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins
2022; Ruff et al. 2020). PNW-Cnet has been expanded to detect vocalizations of
ca. 80 forest wildlife species and numerous forms of anthropogenic and
environmental noise (Ruff et al. 2021, 2023).

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（如GPT-4o）从文本中提取经济叙事的潜力，并与专家标注的标准进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，经济叙事的研究兴趣增加，但现有方法（如BERT）缺乏深层语义理解，无法区分经济叙事提取与传统任务（如语义角色标注）。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，应用严格的叙事定义，比较GPT-4o输出与专家标注的黄金标准。

Result: GPT-4o能以结构化格式提取有效的经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以应对复杂任务，并为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理多为孤立系统，无法同时处理物理世界与数字信息，限制了其在需要综合能力的任务中的应用。

Method: 开发了Embodied Web Agents任务环境，整合3D模拟环境与功能性网络接口，并构建了涵盖多任务的基准测试。

Result: 实验显示现有AI系统与人类能力存在显著差距，突显了跨领域智能的挑战与机遇。

Conclusion: 论文为结合物理认知与网络知识访问的研究提供了平台与基准，推动了跨领域AI的发展。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于持久同调的拓扑框架，用于检测重大事件对公共话语结构的根本性影响。通过分析国际新闻文章中的名词共现图，结合Wasserstein距离和持久熵，揭示了叙事结构的突然重组和语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种无监督方法，检测全球事件如何重塑公共话语结构，特别是在危机、抗议和信息冲击期间。

Method: 构建每日名词共现图，通过Vietoris-Rips过滤生成持久图，计算Wasserstein距离和持久熵，分析H0和H1维度的变化。

Result: 结果显示，重大事件与H0（连通组件）和H1（循环）的急剧变化相关，表明叙事结构的突然重组。H0变化通常先于H1变化，但俄罗斯入侵乌克兰事件中H1领先H0。

Conclusion: 持久同调提供了一种数学严谨的无监督方法，可实时检测公共话语的语义重构，无需事先了解具体事件。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Motivation: 提出一种统一的神经语音编解码器，将语音的声学、音素和词汇信息分层表示，以更好地支持下游任务。

Method: 利用HuBERT和LaBSE的知识蒸馏目标，分别提取音素和词汇级别的特征，构建分层瓶颈结构。

Result: HAC在英语和多语言数据上表现出解耦的令牌集，优于单层基线，保留了自然性和可解释性。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种离散语音表示，能够桥接声学细节和词汇意义，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Motivation: 解决现实中IMU传感器未紧密附着于人体的问题，提升姿态估计的实用性。

Method: 利用现有服装感知数据集模拟IMU数据，开发基于Transformer的扩散模型合成松散IMU数据并估计姿态。

Result: 在模拟和合成数据上训练的扩散模型在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为松散IMU传感器的姿态估计提供了新方向，结合服装参数可增强模型表现。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量训练数据，面临数据稀缺和高人力成本问题，性能在数据不足时显著下降。

Method: 通过优化扩散模型的文本指令，使用梯度优化后的指令进行推理。

Result: 在单次训练下，能将多种照片转换为逼真且一致的素描，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法更便捷且适用性更广，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Motivation: 当前3D生成模型（如扩散模型）在遵循指令、对齐人类偏好及生成逼真纹理、几何和物理属性方面存在不足。

Method: 基于Nabla-GFlowNet方法，Nabla-R2D3通过2D奖励信号对3D扩散模型进行高效对齐和微调。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效且样本利用率高的对齐方法，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in

for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a

Result: 实验表明，RIP在低数据场景下显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提升至少26%。

Conclusion: RIP通过鲁棒性设计有效解决了LLM的幻觉问题，提升了模仿学习的可靠性。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，视野窄、易受遮挡且深度感知有限，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 结合点特征和物体级地标，引入语义-几何-时间融合策略，设计全向闭环模块，并构建分层3D场景图。

Result: 在真实场景中验证，MCOO-SLAM实现了精确定位和可扩展的物体级地图，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机全向配置和语义增强，显著提升了复杂户外场景中的SLAM性能。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

Motivation: 数据可视化库的准确性对用户体验和决策至关重要，但视觉错误可能误导用户，因此需要深入理解这些错误的特性。

Method: 研究收集了五个广泛使用的数据可视化库中的564个错误，系统分析了症状和根本原因，并提出了分类法。

Result: 发现错误/不准确的图表普遍存在，图形计算错误是主要原因；探索了视觉语言模型（VLM）在检测错误图表中的可行性，效果在29%到57%之间。

Conclusion: 研究为数据可视化库的自动化测试提供了基础，并指出了未来研究方向，如改进VLM的提示设计。

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是全球糖尿病患者的常见并发症，传统诊断方法耗时且资源密集，亟需一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 研究使用Kaggle EyePACS数据集中的3,662张视网膜图像，通过预处理和增强技术优化数据。设计了多种CNN模型（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet等），并转换为TensorFlowLite格式，量化以减少模型大小和提升推理速度。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 研究比较了UNETR和SwinUNETR在T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的性能，发现SwinUNETR在标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性方面表现更优，Dice分数比CNN模型提高了5个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的读者间变异性和跨站点域偏移问题，探索Transformer模型在此类异质性数据中的表现。

Method: 使用UNETR和SwinUNETR模型，基于546个MRI体积数据，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列、腺体大小数据集），并通过Optuna调整超参数。

Result: SwinUNETR在单读者训练中Dice分数为0.816-0.860，在交叉验证混合训练中为0.8583-0.867，在腺体大小数据集中达到0.902-0.894，优于UNETR和基线UNet。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR通过全局和移位窗口自注意力机制有效减少标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，提高了分割精度，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: FAHR-Face是一个基于4000万张面部图像训练的基础模型，用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测，表现出色且具有临床价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过面部外观非侵入性地评估健康和疾病风险，提供廉价且可扩展的生物标志物。

Method: FAHR-FaceAge通过两阶段年龄平衡微调训练，FAHR-FaceSurvival在癌症患者数据上微调，测试了模型鲁棒性和独立性。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在公共数据集上平均绝对误差5.1年，优于基准模型；FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率，最高风险组死亡率是最低组的3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成廉价、可扩展的面部生物标志物，有效捕捉生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种递归变分神经网络（RvNN）用于生成复杂血管结构，克服了现有规则方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解剖树结构在临床诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉其多样性和复杂性。

Method: 开发了RvNN，利用血管的层次结构学习低维流形，编码分支连接和几何特征。

Result: 生成的3D血管模型准确且多样，与真实数据在半径、长度和弯曲度上高度相似。

Conclusion: RvNN首次用于血管合成，为医学训练和模拟提供了新工具。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了多模态学习在真实临床数据中提升神经退行性疾病诊断的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，用于分类8种不同的多参数MRI序列类型，以提高放射科医生的工作效率。DenseNet-121模型表现最佳，内部和外部数据集均验证了其高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多参数MRI（mpMRI）序列的DICOM头信息常因协议多样性和技术错误而不准确，影响放射科医生的工作效率。

Method: 使用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet等深度学习模型对8种MRI序列进行分类，比较性能并研究训练数据量和外部数据集的影响。

Result: DenseNet-121模型在内部数据集上F1-score和准确率分别为0.966和0.972，外部数据集上准确率分别为0.872和0.810。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在多参数MRI序列分类任务中表现出色，适用于不同来源的数据集。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VQGAN和同态加密（HE）的医疗图像推理框架，通过压缩图像和优化激活函数降低计算负担，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像包含敏感信息，需隐私保护；同态加密虽能保护隐私但计算成本高，尤其是大图像。

Method: 使用VQGAN压缩图像为潜在表示，用低阶多项式近似激活函数，结合压缩因子和Squeeze-and-Excitation模块优化。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上测试，压缩因子为8时性能与计算成本达到最优平衡，HE推理速度较慢但性能差异小。

Conclusion: 该方法在医疗图像隐私保护中具有实用潜力，尽管HE推理仍有速度限制。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Conclusion: FedWSIDD是解决复杂WSI分类任务的有效方案，兼具灵活性和隐私保护。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著改善了内窥镜图像质量，为小型化医疗设备提供了实用的噪声解决方案。

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer
classification performance using CNN architectures.

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.
