However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B.

CCPDA has three main steps: (i)\nidentify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization\ntechnique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined\nfire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity\nwhile preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class.

As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings.

However, a limitation is that a\npronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech\nrecognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation\nlexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being\ntreated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a\nspeech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a\ngrapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.\nTo jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM\n(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance\nparticularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the\nWhistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are\nconducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of\nphoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\\% error rate\nreductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword\nor full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain\nadaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms\nthe standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the\nG2P model by 9% error rate reductions.

To\naddress this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that\nautomatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated\ndirectly from the input prompt.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via\nmultifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses\ndue to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of\nself-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc."}

ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR\nLinac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour\npropagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose\naccumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.\nResults: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice\nSimilarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,\nperformance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL\ndataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain\nperformance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose\naccumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95\n>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients\nachieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under\nupper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain\nMR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary\nfeasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints."}

Our VLV pipeline effectively distills\nknowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous\nembeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality\nreconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the\nintermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct\na state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o\nand Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and\nsignificantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal\nimages for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models\n(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for\nmassive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure\nunder $1,000 USD."}

To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a\ndeep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces\n(left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while\npreserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into\na nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate\nsubject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve\nas precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic\ndeformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via\nscaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving\ntransformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and\nself-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex\ndramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing\ncurrent methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy."}

This\napproach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple\noptimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it\nfails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits\nfundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL\nlosses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view\nmultiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations\nthrough two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to\nincorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data\npoint, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views\nwhile scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches\nare theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for\nalignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to\nmulti-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three\nother datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing\nmulti-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.\nWe also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to\nother contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most\nsignificantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views\neffectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding\nspace, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning."}

To be submitted to a conference", "summary": "In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated\ndetection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However,\nachieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In\nthis research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed\nto optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates\nthe strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are\nEfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve\ngeneralization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture\nenhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which\nincorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly\nreduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the\nability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50\narchitecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned\nfor brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for\ntraining deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and\navoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures\nthat the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.\nExtensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate\nthat Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods\nin terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational\nefficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of\n88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates\nthe robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting\nradiologists with brain tumor diagnosis."}

DIL faces two critical challenges in the\ncontext of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class\ndistribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,\nas intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while\ncross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and\ntransferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts\n(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert\nis guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific\nfrequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.\nSubsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing\npseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class\nstatistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot\nknowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class\nperformance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance."}
