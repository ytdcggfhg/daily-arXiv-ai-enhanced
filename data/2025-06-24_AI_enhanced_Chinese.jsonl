As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,\nparticularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80\npercent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving\nMultimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.\nFirst, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse\nmillimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and\npreprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real\nbathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we\nintroduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch\nfor radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch\nfor vibration impact detection.

Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their\nbehaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6743\u8861\u91d1\u94b1\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u52a9\u624b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u91d1\u94b1\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u9002\uff08\u5982\u989d\u5916\u6b65\u884c\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u3001\u9965\u997f\u548c\u75bc\u75db\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u4f4e\u62a5\u916c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u53ca\u65e0\u4e0d\u9002\u65f6\u62d2\u7edd\u9ad8\u62a5\u916c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u6743\u8861\u91d1\u94b1\u4e0e\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different\nsources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors\nor sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and\nLiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a\nrange of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task\norchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs.

Existing LLM Uncertainty\nQuantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn\nquestion-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,\ne.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential\ndecision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the\ncurrent decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic\nuncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty\nshould be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an\nefficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the\ndirect estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\nover multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is\nevaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,\nAgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3.

Such\ninformation includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,\nmaterial specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and\nlabor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,\nengineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable\noutputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%\nrecall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%.

However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly\napplicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo\ntime-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory\nfor conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and\nmany outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle\nwith semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to\naddress these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In\neach stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing\nmemory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame\nalignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each\nvideo and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then\nmodels relationships between video embeddings.

We investigate how pretrained representations from current\nself-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological\nfeature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We\nfocus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the\nretroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers\nof Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the\nCSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these\nsegments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\\'asquez-Correa et\nal., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,\n2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native\nspeakers of American English.

Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output\nbounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are\nmade, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object\nproposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training\npipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D\npoint-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on\nmultiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales.

Our approach\nenhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking\nprocess in question-answering (Q\\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases\n(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for\nhandling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.\nContinuing the \\textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology\nroute of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently\nsolvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through\n\\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent\nforms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either\nKnowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and\nvariables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the\nsolving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval\ntasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning\nanalysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval\nsub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as\nequivalent KBs.

To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output.

We\nconduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,\nevaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six\nopen-source LMs of varying scales and properties.

Additionally, HIDE\nshows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass\nstate-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in\nAUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time.

However, recent studies show that\nSDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to\nunrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in\nstatic scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses\noptimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly\nbetter black-box transferability.

Model editing has been proposed to\ncorrect factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model\nediting (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating\nthem as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate.

Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model.

Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,\ncaptures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment.

Recent\nmethods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to\nsynthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.\nHowever, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in\ndistorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static\n3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.\nTo alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that\nleverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a\nnew perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object\ndynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to\n3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera\ntrajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to\ncomplete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,\nproducing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera\ntrajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early\nstopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and\nimprove visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal\nlarge language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in\ncurrent view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with\nobject movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual\ndynamic scene view generation.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern\nDivide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to\nuse different network modules to \"divide\" various local and global patterns\nand, through flexible feature selection, to \"conquer\" the Regions of Interest\n(ROI) during the decoding phase.

The code is\n  available at\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuVuIgkArCryVSifJDyG7R468DCLMkF2/view?usp=sharing", "summary": "This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a\nnovel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise.

Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines\ndemonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction\nin bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting\noffers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness.

Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are\ncompared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E\nsystems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an\nautomatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data\nfrom 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,\nadditional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.\nCandidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving\nperformance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate\nof the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of\nthis feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to\nremove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.\nFinally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation\napproach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house\nLinguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)\ncorpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\uff08E2E\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea0\u9519\uff08SGEC\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ea7\u8054\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u8054\u548cE2E\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86E2E SGEC\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea0\u9519\uff08SGEC\uff09\u5728\u652f\u6301\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8f6c\u5f55\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u5165\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea7\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u6a21\u5757\u95f4\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684E2E\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ea7\u8054\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u7ea7\u8054\u548cE2E\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eWhisper\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5145\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528ASR\u8f93\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u8003\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Linguaskill\u548cSpeak & Improve\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86E2E SGEC\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "E2E SGEC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u53e3\u8bed\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea0\u9519\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods generally combine\nmultiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on\nstraightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately\ncapture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we\npropose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images\nand text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts\nthe impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics.

One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users.

A key innovation of our work is a\ndata quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing\na large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel\nstatistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.\nInspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal\nmodels, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into\nlayers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex\nreasoning.

However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents\ncritical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often\ndispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle\nto model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional\nspatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering\n(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and\nstrengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by\nclustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with\ncluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional\nintra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which\ndynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via\nfeature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating\nsemantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate\nsemantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo\nintegrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while\nenhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Weakly supervised learning\nprovides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse\nannotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance\ndegradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.\nTo address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised\ncross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main\ncomponents: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature\nlearning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the\nmodality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning\nnetwork effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal\nimages, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation\nperformance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides\nsegmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and\ninter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while\npromoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,\ndelivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both\nchallenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive\nexperiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset\n(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal\nOrgan dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly\nsupervised methods.

To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of\nexplainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these\nconcepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image\nclassification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new\nchallenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in\nimaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as\nalterations in color distribution and scale.

Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process.

We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism.

However, graph-based RAG\nsystems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they\nrequire costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet\nfrequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.\nThis stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply\nsemantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval\nwithout graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet\neffective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact\nentity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it\nidentifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and\nassembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or\nedge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index\nToken Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved\ncontent. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG\noutperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing\nindex size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of\nstructure-free, entity-centric context selection.

This poses\na challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying\nleaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning\nframework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease\nclassification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by\ncombining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting\nthe feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are\nstate-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain\nadapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping\nclasses with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are\nthen passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network\nconsisting of Bi-LSTM layers.

We further enhance the interaction of multimodal\nfeatures by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.\nWe also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world\nscenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by\nfusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.\nOur approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our\nreal-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,\nvarying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at\nhttps://github.com/youjie-zhou/FMF-SLAM.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "FMF-SLAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408SLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08FFT\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ed1\u6697\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ed1\u6697\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4eceRGB\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728TUM\u3001TartanAir\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FMF-SLAM\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9ed1\u6697\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "FMF-SLAM\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548cFFT\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

To address\nthis problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution\ninformation in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo\nlabels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first\nstage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the\nsecond stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected\nframes with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better\npredict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal\ninformation at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization\nperformance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level\npseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)\nmodule, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high\nquality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of\nsequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to\none specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive\nTemporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks\ncalled Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate\nCASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used\nas two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo\nlabels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal\ndomain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve\neach stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels\nfrom another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e27\u7ea7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e27\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08ILG\uff09\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08PTLR\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4ea4\u6362\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To enable this, we\npropose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image\nexplaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation\ncapabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure\nthe efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed\napproaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the\nimprovements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.\nQuantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over\nthe baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by\n81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%\nand 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI\nmodel (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)\nsurpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u6216\u9057\u6f0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u5bf9\u8c61\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, like previous language models, reasoning\nmodels are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are\nincorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

PromptSan includes two variants:\nPromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in\ninput prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and\nPromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize\nharmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,\neffectively balancing safety and usability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPromptSan\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff08PromptSan-Modify\u548cPromptSan-Suffix\uff09\u51c0\u5316\u6709\u5bb3\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5982\u8272\u60c5\u3001\u66b4\u529b\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "PromptSan\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09PromptSan-Modify\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u6709\u5bb3\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2\uff09PromptSan-Suffix\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u540e\u7f00\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u4e2d\u548c\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPromptSan\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PromptSan\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively\nexpensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression\nframework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient\nvariants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our\nmethod systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and\ntransferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the\nperformance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this\nframework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to\ncreate Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE\n(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of\nthe original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned\non a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them\nhighly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and\nremain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves\nsimilar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated\nparameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having\nsignificantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning\ncombined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating\nhigh-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE\narchitectures.

Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB\ndensities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,\nwe approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which\ncorresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule\ncorresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProgramming by Backprop (PBB)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u80fd\u8ba9LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e0\u9700\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ec4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u5e26I/O\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u4e0d\u5e26I/O\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee3\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1bPBB\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684I/O\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba9LLM\u5185\u5316\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u62d3\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities\nbut also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with\ntemporal awareness.

This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across\nmultiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse\nconditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)\nmethod, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate\nconsistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the\nnext-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its\neffectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis.

Subsequently, we propose a unified model that\naccommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training\nstrategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection\nmodules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal\nconditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic\nfeatures are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the\nreconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality.

Ablation studies validate the\nnecessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide\nWSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/BiGen.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiGen\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u62a5\u544a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u75c5\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u75c5\u7406\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u548cWSI\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBiGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u5728PathText\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cNLP\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u53477.4%\uff0cHer-2\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534719.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "BiGen\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive\nMinecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips\nand over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard\nand mouse action annotations.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate.

To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a\nSemantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines\nhigh-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced\nControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and\nsemantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs\noutperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and\nfuture image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal\nreasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for\nspatio-temporal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTAMMs\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u548c\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "TAMMs\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff08SFCI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTAMMs\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u672a\u6765\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325MLLMs\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Effective alignment between motion and musical beats\nenhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,\npromotional content, and cinematic editing.

However,\nexisting film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and\nthus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse\ncamera language and cinematic rhythm.

To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models\nlike (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films.

Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities\nby generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen\nfeatures.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'.

Results demonstrated high accuracy for\nfacies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with\nmoderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,\nFWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA\n0.98, FWIoU 0.97).

However, in existing methods, the image\nsegmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable\ninformation across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and\ninefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we\npropose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method\nnamed LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and\nencoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we\nintroduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact\nand informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively\ncapturing spatial dependencies within the latent space.

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

This is the\ncase with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors\nto influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have\ntraditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments\nnon-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that\nutilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This\napproach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along\nwith its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory\nat different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In\ntotal, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting\nconditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with\npose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired\nat various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a\nRoot-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.\nUsing this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that\nthe classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support\nreproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack\nacquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and\nperformance specifications.
