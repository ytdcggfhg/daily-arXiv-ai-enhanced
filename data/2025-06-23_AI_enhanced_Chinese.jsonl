This research addresses this gap by developing a\nlearning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data\nand a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)\nmaps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the\npotential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our\npreliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance\ncollision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u9759\u6001\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\uff08SDF\uff09\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u800c3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\uff08SDF\uff09\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u7279\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u578b3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9759\u6001SDF\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u62e5\u5835\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients\ndiagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria.

PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance\n(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W\nscans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)\nand 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved\nDSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98\nmm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP).

Because of its\nunidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous\nstates and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision\nmethods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward\nscan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a\nfull receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,\neroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To\neliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM\nblock that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward\nselective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on\nLBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan\ndirections every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra\nbackward sweeps.

Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend\narchitecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted\nin state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been\nintroduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,\nthereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,\ntheir performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss\nregarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the\nreceptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal\ndensely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip\nconnections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend\narchitecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind\nspots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.\nExperimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly\navailable datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that\nthe proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nmethods.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects\nthe explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to\nimprove the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the\none hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the\nscene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as\nposition prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate\nthe implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event\nrelation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event\nboundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the\nsemantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to\nverify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental\nresults also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet\nCaptions and YouCook2 datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "PR-DETR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5148\u9a8c\u6539\u8fdb\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPR-DETR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u951a\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6ce8\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728ActivityNet Captions\u548cYouCook2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PR-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5148\u9a8c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer.

We\nconstruct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.\nThese matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid\ntransformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world\nlandslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement\nestimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.\nDeviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements\n(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,\nrespectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived\nreferences.

(2) Perception as a\npredictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement\nwith science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption\nis the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal\ninfluence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully\ndesigned natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public\nperception of scientific information has direct connections with the final\nengagement pattern.

To address this limitation, we\npropose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual\ndescriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in\nhyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts\nboth visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language\nfoundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality\nAlignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic\nHierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through\nentailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.\nThe classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the\nsimilarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This\neliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware\napproach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves\nsuperior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting\nthe potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperPath\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21WSI\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347WSI\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349WSI\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperPath\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89d2\u5ea6\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperPath\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u5728WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperPath\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WSI\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates\narchitectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,\nand supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.\nExperimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity\ncompared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve\ncompetitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform\nbaselines on text-to-speech tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LM-SPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u77ed\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u97f3-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u51c6\u964d\u5e27\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLM-SPT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u95f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6ce2\u5f62\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u5e27\u7387\u3002", "result": "LM-SPT\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SLM\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LM-SPT\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u8fc7\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis.

All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address\npotential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined\nto use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher\npredicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher\nat posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,\ntwo out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits\nfrom LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These\nmoderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the\nlearners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not\nsignificantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as\nhelpful.

In this work, we\nintroduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming\nto achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known\ninformation scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary\nenhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed\nto learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these\nboundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary\npre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on\nknown category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries\nusing labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided\ndecision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further\nenhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved\npseudo-labeled samples.

Our method is enabled by a key insight: The\nvector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.\nThis enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability\ndistribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more\noutput information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains\nover previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving\n2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case\nincreasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits\nsurprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on\n16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase\nthe number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong\nperformance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden\nsystem messages.

Second, as\nparameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical\nabout causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.\nDespite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation\nCoefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,\nCLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine\ncausal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for\napplications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLEAR-3K\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b3000\u4e2a\u65ad\u8a00-\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u4e2a\u9648\u8ff0\u662f\u5426\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u9648\u8ff0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6000\u7591\u8f6c\u5411\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a5\u53d7\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1CLEAR-3K\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa3000\u4e2a\u65ad\u8a00-\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3021\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\uff080.5B\u81f372B\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u6df7\u6dc6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6000\u7591\u8f6c\u5411\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a5\u53d7\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\uff08MCC\uff09\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec50.55\u3002", "conclusion": "CLEAR-3K\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

In this work, first, we study different generative\narchitectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are\nunbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a\nnovel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet\ndecomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model\nto exploit more relevant forensic cues.

In this work, we introduce\nthe Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly\nevaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor\nscenarios.

Since a centroid is\nderived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise\nmeasurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of\ncircle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.\nTo surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the\ncircular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the\ncheckerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular\npatterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid\nuncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including\npattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide\nguidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation\nmetric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a\ntwo-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.\nThe shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an\nappropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem.

These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT\nidentifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion\nin the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the\ninput. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an\nopposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal\nsignal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful\nattack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple\nsampling to approximate the output distribution.

We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users\nand professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),\nand another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot\nfrom LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence\nembeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment\nby applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether\nresponses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and\nvalidated it using Euclidean distances.

This approach supports organizational\napplications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic\ncommunication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eElo\u8bc4\u7ea7\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u89c4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u7684\u5185\u7f6e\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u62d2\u7edd\u6267\u884c\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6548\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5206\u6790\u7ec4\u7ec7\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u4fb5\u72af\u6216\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff09\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Elo\u8bc4\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdbLLMs\u5bf9\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5fae\u4fb5\u72af\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u804c\u573a\u9a9a\u6270\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6bd2\u6c9f\u901a\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Extensive evaluations on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves\ncompetitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical\nsolution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,\nand computer vision.\n  The source code for our implementation will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/GreatenAnoymous/RGBTrack.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "RGBTrack\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u65f66D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u6bd4\u8f83\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u906e\u6321\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u8c61\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408FoundationPose\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u6bd4\u8f83\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u62102D\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08XMem\uff09\u3001\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "RGBTrack\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal\nmechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving\nbehavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by\nassigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model\ncomponents. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer\nperceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual\nassociations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook\nthe impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for\nanalyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable\nAttention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping\narbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer\nmodels. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,\ncalculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the\nTopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We\nthen propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to\ndiminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module\nusing only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on\nconcepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their\ncorresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain\nstable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the\nmechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on\nHarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing \"safety\" and improve performance on the GSM8K\nbenchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying \"reasoning\".

Recent attempts train VLMs\nto render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often\nhinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental\nimagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we\ninvestigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories\nwithout producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental\nImagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent\nvisual tokens alongside ordinary text.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of\ngenerative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In\nresponse, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative\nmodels to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal\ninformation processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,\nwhich allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene\ncomprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate\nstate space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear\ncomputational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to\nlearn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the\nlearning process while maintaining performance.

It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global\nstructural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we\npropose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR)\nframework.

Specifically, a\nmotion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric\nreconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical\nstructures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that\nperforms residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual\nfeatures. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision.\nFurther, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as\na continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice\ncompletion and high-frequency detail recovery.

However, prior studies have mostly targeted\ntask- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature\ncoding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we\npresent the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large\nmodels. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally\nincompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,\nfeatures from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while\nthose from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This\ndistributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and\ncross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned\npeaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed\nfeature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation\nis non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of\nheterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this\nalignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can\neffectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate\nour approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and\nSD3-across multiple tasks and modalities.

Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide\nsupplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological\nfunction changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of\nphysiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by\npositron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the\nsame energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this\nstudy, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer\nmodel (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent\nspace for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates\ndiffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,\nwith the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image\ndetails. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,\nthe model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance\ncomputational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as\nconditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,\nthereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image\ntextures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this\nconditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer\nseparation.

In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and\nhigh-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset\ncontains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and\narticulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates\ngeometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions\nto enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly\nintroduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods leverage rich image priors from\npre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic\ndata, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits\ntheir effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane\nsynchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities\ncan be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain.
