### [1] [CycleDistill: Bootstrapping Machine Translation using LLMs with Cyclical Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19952)
*Deepon Halder,Thanmay Jayakumar,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CycleDistill利用LLMs和少样本翻译，通过迭代生成合成平行语料库，无需大量平行语料即可提升低资源语言的机器翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言因缺乏平行语料库而难以实现高质量机器翻译的问题。

Method: 提出CycleDistill方法，通过少样本翻译生成合成平行语料库，并迭代优化模型。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，首轮迭代即可显著提升翻译质量，优于少样本基线模型20-30 chrF点。

Conclusion: CycleDistill为低资源语言提供了一种高效的高质量机器翻译解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

### [2] [Inference Scaled GraphRAG: Improving Multi Hop Question Answering on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19967)
*Travis Thompson,Seung-Hwan Lim,Paul Liu,Ruoying He,Dongkuan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Inference-Scaled GraphRAG的新框架，通过推理时间计算扩展提升LLM在图推理任务中的表现，显著改进了多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏结构化上下文和多跳信息。现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法未能充分捕捉知识图谱中节点间的关系结构。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（深度链式图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），在交替的推理-执行循环中实现推理时间计算扩展。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，该方法显著优于传统GraphRAG和基线图遍历方法，提升了多跳问答性能。

Conclusion: 推理时间扩展是一种实用且与架构无关的解决方案，适用于LLMs的结构化知识推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

### [3] [Doc2Agent: Scalable Generation of Tool-Using Agents from API Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19998)
*Xinyi Ni,Haonan Jian,Qiuyang Wang,Vedanshi Chetan Shah,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Doc2Agent是一个可扩展的流程，用于从API文档生成可执行的Python工具，并通过代码代理迭代优化这些工具。该方法在真实API上表现优异，性能提升55%，成本降低90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有API代理依赖统一工具集，无法反映真实API的复杂性，而构建跨领域工具代理需要处理非结构化API文档和参数推断的挑战。

Method: Doc2Agent从API文档生成可执行工具，并通过代码代理迭代优化工具。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，性能提升55%，成本降低90%，并在特定领域（如糖材料科学）中展示了适应性。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

### [4] [A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073)
*Kethmi Hirushini Hettige,Jiahao Ji,Cheng Long,Shili Xiang,Gao Cong,Jingyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STReason是一个结合大型语言模型（LLM）和时空模型的新框架，用于多任务推理和复杂时空数据分析，无需任务特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空数据挖掘模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和深入解释能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: STReason利用上下文学习将复杂查询分解为模块化程序，生成解决方案和详细解释。

Result: 实验表明STReason在复杂时空推理任务中显著优于先进LLM基线，并通过人工评估验证其实用性。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更通用和强大的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

### [5] [SACL: Understanding and Combating Textual Bias in Code Retrieval with Semantic-Augmented Reranking and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20081)
*Dhruv Gupta,Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy,Yiqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了检索增强代码生成（RACG）中代码检索的依赖性和偏见，提出SACL框架以改进检索和生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索器过度依赖表面文本特征和文档偏见，影响了代码检索和生成的准确性。

Method: 通过系统性地屏蔽特定特征并保留代码功能，分析检索行为；提出SACL框架，增强语义信息以减少偏见。

Result: SACL显著提升了代码检索性能（如Recall@1提升12.8%/9.4%/7.0%），并改善了代码生成（Pass@1提升4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL通过丰富语义信息和减少偏见，有效提升了代码检索和生成的质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

### [6] [Bridging Compositional and Distributional Semantics: A Survey on Latent Semantic Geometry via AutoEncoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20083)
*Yingji Zhang,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨如何通过组合和符号属性增强Transformer自回归语言模型的可解释性和泛化能力，并比较三种自编码器架构的潜在几何特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布语义空间缺乏可解释性和可控性，通过结合组合语义学可以弥补这一缺陷，缩小符号与分布语义之间的差距。

Method: 综述了三种主流自编码器架构（VAE、VQVAE、SAE），分析它们在语义结构和可解释性方面的潜在几何特性。

Result: 通过组合语义学视角，揭示了不同自编码器架构在语义表示学习中的独特几何特性。

Conclusion: 组合语义学为语义表示学习提供了新视角，有助于提升语言模型的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,
compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel
perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

### [7] [ITFormer: Bridging Time Series and Natural Language for Multi-Modal QA with Large-Scale Multitask Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20093)
*Yilin Wang,Peixuan Lei,Jie Song,Yuzhe Hao,Tao Chen,Yuxuan Zhang,Lei Jia,Yuanxiang Li,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Time-Series QA任务和EngineMT-QA数据集，并设计了ITFormer框架，通过结合时间序列编码器和大型语言模型，显著提升了问答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维时间序列数据与自然语言的动态交互任务是一个重要挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了ITFormer框架，结合时间序列编码器和冻结的大型语言模型，提取、对齐和融合时间与文本特征。

Result: ITFormer在问答准确性上显著优于基线模型，且仅增加了不到1%的可训练参数。

Conclusion: 该研究为时间数据与自然语言的结合提供了高效、灵活的范式，推动了多模态AI的研究和应用。

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in
multi-modal AI. More details about the project, including datasets and code,
are available at: https://pandalin98.github.io/itformer_site/

### [8] [A Multi-Pass Large Language Model Framework for Precise and Efficient Radiology Report Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20112)
*Songsoo Kim,Seungtae Lee,See Young Lee,Joonho Kim,Keechan Kan,Dukyong Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 三阶段LLM框架显著提高了放射学报告的阳性预测值（PPV）并降低了运营成本，同时保持了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于错误率低，基于LLM的放射学报告校对阳性预测值（PPV）有限，需改进框架以提升PPV和降低成本。

Method: 回顾性分析1,000份放射学报告，测试三种LLM框架：单提示检测器、提取器加检测器、以及提取器、检测器和假阳性验证器。

Result: 三阶段框架PPV显著提升至0.159，运营成本降低42.6%，外部验证支持其优越性。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架为AI辅助放射学报告质量保证提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

### [9] [Leveraging AI Graders for Missing Score Imputation to Achieve Accurate Ability Estimation in Constructed-Response Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20119)
*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性，同时显著减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估学习者的高阶能力（如表达能力和逻辑思维）需求增加，但传统构建式测试评分成本高且耗时。IRT虽能从不完整数据估计能力，但缺失数据比例高时准确性下降。

Method: 利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数，结合IRT进行能力估计。

Result: 新方法在能力估计中实现高准确性，并显著减少人工评分工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效评估学习者能力提供了可行解决方案，尤其在数据稀疏或异质时表现优异。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [10] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CCRS（Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score）评估框架，利用预训练LLM作为零样本端到端评估器，解决RAG系统多维度质量评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估方法在捕捉上下文连贯性、查询相关性等复杂质量维度上存在不足，或效率低下。

Method: 设计CCRS，包含五个指标（CC、QR、ID、AC、IR），基于单一预训练LLM进行零样本评估。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上验证CCRS能有效区分不同RAG系统性能，如Mistral-7B优于Llama变体。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供高效、全面的评估框架，优于现有复杂方法。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

### [11] [AALC: Large Language Model Efficient Reasoning via Adaptive Accuracy-Length Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20160)
*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AALC是一种轻量级的准确性感知长度奖励方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性，显著减少推理模型的响应长度，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过生成冗长的思维链实现推理能力，但这种方式导致高延迟和成本，且准确性提升有限。

Method: AALC将验证准确性纳入奖励函数，并采用动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟长度惩罚直至达到目标性能。

Result: 实验表明，AALC将响应长度减少50%以上，同时保持或提高原始准确性，并减少冗余推理模式。

Conclusion: AALC展示了基于奖励的策略在引导LRMs实现更高效、通用推理路径方面的潜力，但也可能牺牲部分可解释性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

### [12] [SEED: A Structural Encoder for Embedding-Driven Decoding in Time Series Prediction with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20167)
*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED是一种用于多元时间序列预测的结构编码器，通过结合语言模型嵌入和任务感知原型，解决了结构依赖与语义推理之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器缺乏语义推理能力，而大型语言模型无法直接处理时间序列数据，限制了统一预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED包含四个阶段：令牌感知编码器、投影模块、语义重编程机制和冻结语言模型，实现了数值模式与语义推理的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SEED在多个数据集上优于基线方法，有效填补了结构-语义建模的空白。

Conclusion: SEED通过模块化架构实现了高效的结构与语义对齐，为多元时间序列预测提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Qingni Wang,Xiaofeng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN是一个不确定性保护选择框架，通过统计校准阈值在用户指定的FDR约束下筛选生成答案，显著提高样本保留率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有不确定性量化方法缺乏形式化保证的问题，特别是选择性预测中的错误发现率（FDR）控制。

Method: 采用COIN框架，通过校准集估计经验错误率，并使用Clopper-Pearson等方法建立真实错误率的高概率上限。

Result: COIN在风险控制、测试时保留合格答案的能力以及有限校准数据下的预测效率方面表现出色。

Conclusion: COIN具有扩展性和适应性，适用于多样化应用场景，并能通过替代上限构造和UQ策略进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过检索高质量示例提升大语言模型在对话情感识别任务中的表现，发现增强示例检索方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多个领域有广泛应用，但在主观任务（如情感识别）中实现高准确性仍具挑战性。

Method: 研究了随机和增强示例检索策略，并分析了对话上下文对情感识别准确性的影响。

Result: 在IEMOCAP、MELD和EmoryNLP数据集上的实验表明，增强示例检索方法在所有数据集中表现最优。

Conclusion: 检索高质量且连贯的示例并通过改写增强，对提升对话情感识别准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

*Petra Barančíková,Ondřej Bojar*

TL;DR: 比较捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型，发现内在语义相似性测试表现好的模型在下游任务中未必表现最佳，反之亦然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨句子嵌入模型在内在语义相似性和下游任务（如机器翻译评估）中的表现差异。

Method: 使用Costra数据集和STS基准进行内在评估，通过COMET指标进行外在评估。

Result: 内在测试表现好的模型在下游任务中不一定最优，而某些模型通过微调能取得更好结果。

Conclusion: 需要更多研究来理解句子嵌入的语义属性与下游任务之间的关系。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多视角的软标签方法，以更好地捕捉人类标注者的多样性观点，在主观文本分类任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法通过聚合标注者观点来建立单一真实标签，但忽略了少数观点，尤其是在主观任务中。本研究旨在开发更具包容性和多元化的模型。

Method: 采用多视角软标签方法，分析多个主观文本分类任务（如仇恨言论、讽刺、辱骂语言和立场检测），并使用Jensen-Shannon Divergence（JSD）和F1分数评估效果。

Result: 多视角方法在近似人类标签分布和分类性能（F1分数）上优于传统方法，但在讽刺和立场检测任务中置信度较低。

Conclusion: 多视角方法能更好地捕捉人类分歧，但需进一步解决主观性任务中的不确定性。通过XAI揭示了模型预测的有意义见解。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过结构化推理增强大语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，结合监督微调和优化算法，显著提升了模型的推理能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，主要依赖隐式统计关系，缺乏结构化知识表示。

Method: 将非结构化数据转换为结构化格式，标注推理步骤，通过监督微调（SFT）训练LLMs，并采用GRPO优化算法（MAX-Flow和LCS）增强推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上实现了简洁推理、鲁棒性能和优化兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理的集成显著提升了LLMs的推理效果，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分块的自动流利度评估方法，结合自监督学习模型和分层CNN-BiLSTM框架，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非母语者的语音流利度评估（AFA）在捕捉语音节奏、停顿和不流畅性方面仍具挑战性，需要更精细的建模方法。

Method: 采用分块策略，结合多种自监督学习模型（Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、WavLM），通过加权融合机制平衡声学和语言特征，并利用CNN-BiLSTM捕捉局部和长期依赖关系。

Result: 在Avalinguo和Speechocean762数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8-4.2和6.2-4.0点，优于单模型和Pyannote.audio基线。

Conclusion: 分块多模型融合方法显著提升了流利度评估的鲁棒性，未来可进一步研究其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速演变的媒体叙事需要动态分析方法，而现有方法（如大型语言模型）在大规模语料中应用成本高。

Method: 结合主题模型和变化点检测，筛选代表性文档，再用大型语言模型自动解析内容与叙事变化。

Result: 大型语言模型能有效提取叙事变化，但在区分内容变化与叙事变化时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能动态捕捉叙事变化，但在区分叙事与内容变化方面仍需改进。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

TL;DR: Biomed-Enriched是一个通过两阶段标注过程构建的生物医学文本数据集，包含临床病例等高价值内容，为生物医学NLP提供了开放资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本通常因隐私限制难以获取，Biomed-Enriched通过PubMed公开数据提供了大规模临床病例集合，填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用大语言模型标注40万段PubMed文本，再通过小模型扩展到PMC-OA语料库，提取高质量子集并进行质量过滤和领域上采样。

Result: 实验显示临床上采样和教学质量过滤分别提升模型性能5%和1%，组合方法还能减少训练量。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched为生物医学预训练提供了高效策略，并成为宝贵的开放资源。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

Conclusion: TAPS通过整合用户偏好，有效提升了LLMs的个性化工具使用能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them

user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation
in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool
use. To this end, we introduce \name, a novel solution that enhances
personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断因临床异质性、低流行率和医生对其不熟悉而具有挑战性，需要高效准确的诊断工具。

Method: DeepRare由中央主机、长期记忆模块和专用代理服务器组成，整合40多种工具和最新医学知识，支持复杂诊断推理。

Result: 在8个数据集上评估，DeepRare对2,919种疾病诊断准确率达100%（1013种疾病），Recall@1平均57.18%，显著优于其他15种方法。

Conclusion: DeepRare在罕见病诊断中表现出色，已实现为易用网页应用，具有高临床专家认可度。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

<details>

Motivation: 由于LLMs在安全关键应用中的广泛使用，需要同时提升其能力和安全性，以确保与人类价值观和偏好一致。

Method: 通过CoDoT将自然语言输入转换为代码形式，评估LLMs的安全性表现。

Result: 实验表明，CoDoT导致多种先进LLMs的安全性显著下降，例如GPT-4 Turbo的毒性增加16.5倍，DeepSeek R1失败率100%。

Conclusion: CoDoT揭示了LLMs安全性的严重不足，强调了从基本原理出发评估安全性的重要性，以确保安全性与能力同步发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

Motivation: 研究对话中说话时间的分配及其动态变化对参与者感知的影响，为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供新工具。

Method: 引入计算框架，量化对话级和动态级的说话时间分配，并应用于大规模视频聊天数据集。

Result: 平衡的对话更受欢迎，尤其是说话较少的一方；即使总体平衡相同，不同的动态分配方式也会影响感知。

Conclusion: 框架为计算机辅助沟通平台设计提供了新工具，适用于人-人和人-人工智能沟通。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在部署和推理时面临模型规模过大的挑战，现有方法主要关注单一模型剪枝。

Method: 将模型压缩问题转化为零阶优化问题，支持层移除、层选择和层合并三种操作。

Result: 实验表明，压缩后的模型（如Llama2-13B）在移除约25%参数的同时，保持了97.3%的原始性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在模型压缩方面优于现有技术，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

Motivation: LLMs在适应外部库API频繁更新时表现不佳，限制了其在动态环境中的可靠代码生成能力。

Method: 构建数据集训练LLMs进行版本迁移，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习的奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升LLMs在动态API场景中的性能，尤其在未见过的CodeUpdateArena任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: ReCode是一种有效的解决方案，能在不显著影响LLMs通用能力的情况下提升其适应API更新的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索基础语言模型如何适应强化学习，以开发下一代可扩展的RL基础模型。

Method: 比较Qwen和Llama模型家族，分析中训练策略对RL动态的影响，并提出两阶段训练策略Stable-then-Decay。

Result: 高质量数学语料和QA数据提升RL性能，但长链推理数据可能导致模型回答冗长和训练不稳定。OctoThinker模型缩小了与RL友好模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 中训练策略对RL性能至关重要，Stable-then-Decay策略有效，开源模型和语料支持未来研究。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

Conclusion: 行为编辑为代理行为引导提供了新范式，但同时也需警惕其潜在风险。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在代码生成中的潜力，通过分析其解码行为和提出新的强化学习方法（coupled-GRPO），显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs因其全局规划和迭代优化特性在代码生成中具有优势，但其训练和推理机制尚不明确，本文旨在揭示其解码行为并优化其性能。

Method: 训练了一个7B参数的dLLM（DiffuCoder），分析了其解码行为，并提出了一种新的强化学习采样方案（coupled-GRPO）以优化训练效率。

Result: coupled-GRPO显著提升了DiffuCoder在代码生成基准上的性能（EvalPlus上提升4.4%），并减少了对自回归因果解码的依赖。

Conclusion: 本文深入揭示了dLLM的生成机制，并提供了一个高效的扩散原生强化学习框架。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

TL;DR: Memento是一种新的提示策略，通过分解问题、动态构建事实数据库并整合信息，显著提升了LLMs在多跳问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在纯推理任务中表现优异，但在需要推理与检索紧密结合的任务（如多跳问答）中表现不佳。

Method: Memento采用三阶段策略：1) 分解复杂问题为小步骤；2) 动态构建事实数据库；3) 整合信息解决问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著提升了性能，如在PhantomWiki上性能翻倍，在2WikiMultiHopQA上提升20 F1点。

Conclusion: Memento是一种有效的策略，能够显著提升LLMs在多跳问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在权衡社交与信息价值时的表现，使用认知模型评估其与人类决策的相似性，并分析了训练动态对价值权衡的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具在解释LLMs中动态、多方面的价值权衡方面有限，而认知科学中的认知模型为人类决策提供了形式化描述。

Method: 采用认知模型分析LLMs的价值权衡，评估不同推理努力程度和RL后训练动态。

Result: 发现推理模型更注重信息效用，开源模型在数学推理中表现更强；训练早期价值权衡变化显著。

Conclusion: 方法适用于快速发展的LLM领域，有助于形成假设、优化训练策略及控制价值权衡。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Motivation: 喷雾器喷杆的不稳定性是喷雾应用误差的主要因素之一，但目前缺乏定量数据来改进设计和控制系统。

Method: 使用YOLO V7、V8和V11神经网络模型实时跟踪喷杆边缘目标，并结合倾角传感器验证模型输出。

Result: 模型检测目标准确率超过90%，距离估计误差在0.026米以内。

Conclusion: 该系统可量化喷杆运动，为设计改进提供数据支持，从而提高喷雾稳定性与精度。

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，EBC-ZIP表现优于EBC，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: EBC-ZIP通过更合理的概率损失改进人群计数性能，适用于不同计算复杂度的模型。

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves
critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA
outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual
and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,
making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration. The code will be

Method: 提出BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，带有像素级标注的伪影区域，并通过人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 实验表明，基于BrokenVideos训练的模型显著提升了伪影定位能力，为相关研究提供了重要基准。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos填补了研究空白，为生成视频模型的伪影定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: UniCode^2提出了一种级联的视觉标记化框架，解决了现有方法在小词汇量或大规模扩展时的问题，实现了稳定、语义对齐的视觉标记化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉标记化方法要么词汇量小，缺乏细粒度语义，要么盲目扩展导致标记利用率低和训练不稳定。

Method: 通过聚类数百万SigLIP序列嵌入构建50万条目的代码本，采用级联设计（冻结代码本锚定嵌入空间，可训练代码本细化任务语义）确保稳定性和高利用率。

Result: UniCode^2在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持高质量视觉合成，且无需牺牲稳定性、语义或模块性。

Conclusion: UniCode^2证明了在不牺牲稳定性、语义或模块性的前提下扩展视觉标记空间的可行性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方案在重建质量和去模糊性能上优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效优化了带宽利用，同时提升了重建和去模糊效果。

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

Motivation: 手写识别通常仅利用单一模态（图像或笔划数据），而忽略了二者的互补性，本文旨在通过融合两种模态提升性能。

Method: 设计了一个端到端网络，通过补丁编码器将灰度图像转换为视觉标记，轻量级Transformer嵌入笔划序列，并通过可学习的潜在查询联合处理两种模态。

Conclusion: 早期融合图像和笔划数据能增强表示学习，提升手写识别的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

Result: 在三个细粒度数据集上，HMDRN表现优于现有方法，并通过消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: HMDRN通过双层次重建和掩码增强，显著提升了细粒度分类性能，减少了类内差异。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized
baselines, highlighting their limited real-world generalization. In contrast,
DenseDiT achieves superior results using less than 0.01% training data of
baselines, underscoring its practical value for real-world deployment. Our

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验验证了方法在注册和融合中的有效性，并提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法从光谱域解决了注册问题，结合BSF方法显著提升了融合效果和计算效率。

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中表现出色，但容易陷入局部最优，导致全局不一致或条件不匹配。

Method: 通过奖励模型识别局部最优，注入噪声并回退到更早状态以逃离，动态交替前向优化和后向探索。

Result: 实验表明，Ctrl-Z Sampling显著提高了生成质量，仅增加约7.6倍的函数评估。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling是一种模型无关的方法，可提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly
available datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the diffusion model, combined
with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

Conclusion: 个性化放射组学指纹不仅提升了诊断性能，还提供了临床洞见和潜在生物标志物发现的可能性。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

Conclusion: 通过检测和抑制突发性人脸，可以有效提升SFR的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

Motivation: 历史文档布局复杂，需要鲁棒的文档布局分析（DLA）方法，以支持自动化处理和理解。

Method: 在三个数据集（e-NDP、CATMuS、HORAE）上测试了五种模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO、YOLO变种），比较其性能。

Result: Co-DETR在e-NDP上表现最佳（0.752 mAP），而YOLOv11x-OBB在复杂数据集（CATMuS、HORAE）上更优（0.564、0.568）。OBB是关键改进。

Conclusion: Transformer适合结构化布局，CNN-OBB模型在复杂文档中泛化能力更强，OBB是历史文档分析的必要条件。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: HiT和DyHiT在速度和精度上取得平衡，动态路由方法可加速高性能跟踪器。

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

Result: 在Stable Diffusion XL上的评估显示，HiWave显著减少了伪影，用户研究中80%以上的案例优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HiWave无需重新训练或架构修改，即可实现高质量的超高分辨率图像合成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

Motivation: 地下矿山中的岩石螺栓对结构加固至关重要，但传统的人工检测方法在低光条件和时间消耗上存在困难，现有自动化技术也因数据噪声和目标尺寸小等问题缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DeepBolt，一种两阶段深度学习架构，专门处理类别不平衡问题，用于在复杂3D点云中识别岩石螺栓。

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point
clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.
Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,
achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,
demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground
environments.

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

Result: 在26个数据集上的实验表明，PLADA在检测压缩和有限配对数据下的深度伪造图像时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLADA不仅解决了块效应问题，还为开放世界场景提供了鲁棒的深度伪造检测方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用时间信息，提升了检测性能，并贡献了新数据集BOAT360。

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督视频摘要模型，无需注意力机制或复杂架构，性能优于现有无监督方法，接近监督模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频内容普及导致对高效摘要的需求增加，但现有方法依赖监督标注或计算昂贵的注意力模型，跨域适用性差。

Method: 采用自监督学习框架，结合马尔可夫过程驱动的损失指标和两阶段学习范式，避免使用注意力、RNN或Transformer。

Result: 在SUMME和TVSUM数据集上达到最先进性能，优于无监督方法，接近监督模型。

Conclusion: 展示了高效、无需标注的视频摘要潜力，挑战了对复杂架构的依赖，为更通用的技术铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

TL;DR: WonderFree是一个交互式3D场景生成模型，解决了现有方法在探索性和视角一致性上的问题，通过WorldRestorer和ConsistView提升渲染质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D生成方法在探索性和视角一致性上存在局限，无法在超出原始视角的大范围移动中保持高质量渲染。

Method: 提出WonderFree模型，包括WorldRestorer（消除视觉伪影）和ConsistView（多视角联合恢复机制），并设计数据收集流程。

Result: 实验表明，WonderFree显著提升了渲染质量和全局一致性，用户偏好率达77.20%。

Conclusion: WonderFree为3D场景生成提供了更自由和沉浸式的探索体验，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Conclusion: SFNet通过多域特征融合有效提升了伪造检测性能，适用于多样化遥感数据。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: VIPScene利用视频生成模型的3D物理世界常识知识，通过文本和图像提示生成高真实性和结构一致性的3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D场景合成需要专家知识和大量手动操作，自动化此过程可广泛应用于建筑设计、机器人模拟等领域。现有方法如LLMs和图像生成模型在3D空间推理和多视角一致性上存在局限。

Method: VIPScene结合视频生成、前馈3D重建和开放词汇感知模型，通过文本和图像提示分析场景中每个对象的语义和几何信息。引入FPVScore评估一致性和合理性。

Result: 实验表明VIPScene显著优于现有方法，且能泛化到多样场景。

Conclusion: VIPScene为3D场景合成提供了高真实性和结构一致性的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant
manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as
architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

Conclusion: Shape2Animal为视觉叙事、教育内容、数字艺术和交互媒体设计提供了新机会。

Abstract: Humans possess a unique ability to perceive meaningful patterns in ambiguous
stimuli, a cognitive phenomenon known as pareidolia. This paper introduces
Shape2Animal framework to mimics this imaginative capacity by reinterpreting
natural object silhouettes, such as clouds, stones, or flames, as plausible
animal forms. Our automated framework first performs open-vocabulary
segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive
media design. Our project page is here: https://shape2image.github.io

Conclusion: 优化相机姿态对NeRF在空间物体重建中的性能至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

Method: 提出MMSearch-R1框架，结合图像和文本搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚指导模型决策。

Result: 实验表明，MMSearch-R1在相同模型规模下优于RAG基线，且减少30%以上的搜索调用。

Conclusion: MMSearch-R1为多模态搜索研究提供了高效且按需的解决方案，并提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

Motivation: 现有全景场景完成方法在视觉模态和动态适应性方面存在不足，IPFormer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: IPFormer利用图像上下文动态初始化实例提案，并通过注意力机制优化语义实例-体素关系。

Result: IPFormer在PQ$^\dagger$和PQ-All指标上超越现有方法，运行时间减少14倍以上。

Conclusion: 动态实例提案显著提升了全景场景完成的性能，IPFormer为视觉模态的3D场景理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.

TL;DR: PSALM-V是一个自主神经符号学习系统，能够在视觉环境中通过交互推断符号动作语义（如前提和后置条件），无需专家定义动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本领域或不切实际的假设（如预定义问题文件、完全可观察性或显式错误消息），而PSALM-V旨在动态推断PDDL问题文件和动作语义。

Method: PSALM-V利用LLM生成启发式计划和候选符号语义，通过分析执行结果和合成可能的错误解释，迭代生成和执行计划，同时维护对动作语义的树状信念。

Result: 在ALFRED任务中，PSALM-V将计划成功率从37%提升至74%；在RTFM和Overcooked-AI中提高了步骤效率，并在多智能体设置中成功诱导领域语义。

Conclusion: PSALM-V在部分观察设置和多智能体环境中表现优异，能够有效推断符号语义，适用于真实世界机器人任务。

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

Method: 使用包含240段人机对话的多模态数据集，引入四种对话失败类型，评估计算机视觉模型的性能。

Result: 模型在识别沟通错误时表现不佳，仅略优于随机猜测；在情感表达更丰富的数据集上表现较好。人类评分者也仅能识别约一半的错误。

Conclusion: 用户感知到错误但未反馈是主要限制，研究结果有助于设计更好的人机对话系统，明确反馈需求。

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

Result: 发现尽管抓取试验中物体多样性高，网络仍能从所有物体联合训练中受益。

Conclusion: 多样化的物体数据可以共同促进同一目标的实现。

Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent
that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the
uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act
under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and
uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have
connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method
for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an
image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We
generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real
images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object
variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects
jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless
contribute to the same goal.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在实时人类感知任务中的能力及其性能与延迟的权衡，以提升人机交互（HRI）效果。

Method: 构建HRIBench基准测试，包含1000个视觉问答问题，覆盖五个领域，并评估11种VLMs的性能与延迟。

Result: 现有VLMs在核心感知能力上表现不足，且未能满足实时部署的性能与延迟需求。

Conclusion: 未来需开发更小、低延迟的VLMs，以提升其在HRI中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time human perception is crucial for effective human-robot interaction
(HRI). Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable
perceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively
impacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.
To systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and
performance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual
question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse
set of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key
domains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction
understanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social
navigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected
data from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue
understanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four
domains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of
1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of
both state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.
Our results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still
struggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of
the models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory
performance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring
the need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with
improved human perception capabilities. HRIBench and our results can be found

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts

their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

### [87] [X-SiT: Inherently Interpretable Surface Vision Transformers for Dementia Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20267)
*Fabian Bongratz,Tom Nuno Wolf,Jaume Gual Ramon,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的表面视觉变换器（X-SiT），用于基于可解释的皮层特征进行人类可理解的预测，并在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D体积数据难以可视化和解释复杂结构（如大脑皮层），而皮层表面渲染提供了更易理解的3D表示。X-SiT旨在利用这一优势，为神经系统疾病研究提供可解释的预测。

Method: X-SiT结合了原型表面补丁解码器，通过空间对应的皮层原型进行分类，实现了基于案例的推理。

Result: X-SiT在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆检测中达到最先进性能，并提供与已知疾病模式一致的原型。

Conclusion: X-SiT是一种创新的可解释神经网络，为医学图像分析提供了透明且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

TL;DR: DreamAnywhere是一个模块化系统，用于快速生成和原型化3D场景，解决了现有方法在视觉保真度、场景理解和多环境适应性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D场景生成方法存在场景单一、视觉保真度低、缺乏场景理解等问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 系统通过生成360度全景图，分解为背景和对象，通过混合修复构建完整3D表示，并支持沉浸式导航和对象级编辑。

Result: DreamAnywhere在新视角合成一致性和图像质量上显著优于现有方法，用户研究显示其更受青睐。

Conclusion: DreamAnywhere为低成本电影制作等场景提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant
potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although
the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the
challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments
that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene
understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor
settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a
modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system
synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into
background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid
inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in
the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and
intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual
mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These
features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,
enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead
of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it
allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current
state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,
DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view
synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its
effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user
study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,
validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: EditP23是一种无需掩码的3D编辑方法，通过2D图像编辑传播到多视角表示，实现3D一致性编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖文本提示或显式空间掩码，而EditP23通过一对图像（原始视图和用户编辑后的视图）实现直观编辑。

Method: 利用预训练多视角扩散模型的潜在空间中的编辑感知流，将编辑连贯地传播到多视角。

Result: 在多种对象类别和编辑场景中表现高效，保持原始对象的结构和外观，无需手动掩码。

Conclusion: EditP23提供了一种高效、直观的3D编辑方法，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: We present EditP23, a method for mask-free 3D editing that propagates 2D
image edits to multi-view representations in a 3D-consistent manner. In
contrast to traditional approaches that rely on text-based prompting or
explicit spatial masks, EditP23 enables intuitive edits by conditioning on a
pair of images: an original view and its user-edited counterpart. These image
prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a
pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently
propagated across views. Our method operates in a feed-forward manner, without
optimization, and preserves the identity of the original object, in both
structure and appearance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a range of
object categories and editing scenarios, achieving high fidelity to the source
while requiring no manual masks.

*Francesco Ignazio Re,Andreas Opedal,Glib Manaiev,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于时空点过程的概率模型，用于更全面地模拟阅读行为，包括注视点和扫视的动态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型依赖于聚合的眼动追踪数据，忽略了阅读过程中的时空动态特征，因此需要更通用的模型来捕捉这些细节。

Method: 使用标记的时空点过程模型，扫视采用Hawkes过程模拟，注视持续时间通过时间卷积的预测变量建模。

Result: Hawkes过程模型在模拟人类扫视行为上优于基线模型，但上下文惊奇度对注视持续时间的预测改进有限。

Conclusion: 惊奇度理论难以解释精细的眼动行为，需要进一步研究其他影响因素。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

Motivation: 现有基准测试通常依赖明确输入和封闭分类，无法满足真实世界中复杂、开放场景的需求。MIRAGE旨在填补这一空白，提供更贴近实际的评估环境。

Method: 基于35,000多个真实用户-专家互动数据，通过多步骤流程构建，涵盖作物健康、害虫诊断和管理场景，包含7,000多个生物实体。

Result: MIRAGE成为目前最全面的视觉-语言模型基准之一，支持开放世界场景下的推理和长文本生成能力评估。

Conclusion: MIRAGE为多模态模型在农业领域的实际应用提供了高保真度的测试平台，推动了开放场景下专家级推理的研究。

Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning
and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the
agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded
reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world,
knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert
interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline,
MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management
scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities,
covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most
taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded
in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user
inputs and closed-set taxonomies, MIRAGE features underspecified, context-rich
scenarios with open-world settings, requiring models to infer latent knowledge
gaps, handle rare entities, and either proactively guide the interaction or
respond. Project Page: https://mirage-benchmark.github.io

Motivation: 机器学习研究快速发展，但存在错误或误导性研究被接受的问题，缺乏系统性纠正机制。

Method: 提出在会议中设立“反驳与批评”轨道，讨论其设计、评审原则及潜在问题，并以ICLR 2025为例说明。

Result: 通过高声誉平台支持批判性研究，促进研究生态的自我修正。

Conclusion: 机器学习会议应建立官方机制，帮助研究领域自我纠正。

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

*Matthieu Meeus,Igor Shilov,Georgios Kaissis,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习模型记忆训练数据的复杂机制，指出仅依赖自影响（self-influence）会低估记忆化风险，需考虑完整影响分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型记忆训练数据引发隐私和泛化问题，现有研究多关注自影响，但其他因素（如重复样本）对记忆化影响显著。

Method: 将反事实影响视为分布量，计算训练样本间的完整影响分布，分析其特性，并在小语言模型和图像分类任务中验证。

Result: 自影响严重低估记忆化风险，重复样本会降低自影响但仍可被提取；图像分类中影响分布揭示了CIFAR-10中的近似重复样本。

Conclusion: 记忆化源于训练数据的复杂交互，完整影响分布比自影响更能准确捕捉其机制。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

TL;DR: 论文研究了介于离策略强化学习和监督微调之间的算法，通过分析简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，探讨了基线V对性能的影响，并提供了理论保证和实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离策略方法在实现简单性和数据效率上优于同策略方法，但性能往往不佳，因此研究如何通过调整基线V优化离策略RL的性能。

Method: 使用简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，定义优势A=r-V，通过调整基线V来平衡高奖励和低奖励样本的影响。

Result: 理论分析表明，当基线V低于期望奖励时，算法具有策略改进保证；实验验证了在随机多臂老虎机和LLM微调任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 离策略更新应更关注正奖励信号，调整基线V可以显著提升性能，为LLM对齐提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: PLoP是一种轻量级方法，通过理论分析自动确定LoRA适配器的最佳放置位置，优于常见的手动策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LoRA适配器放置策略的优化，以提升大型模型在特定任务上的微调效率。

Method: 提出PLoP方法，通过理论分析自动识别LoRA适配器的最佳放置模块类型。

Result: PLoP在监督微调和强化学习任务中表现优于或与常见手动策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP为LoRA适配器放置提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将掩码扩散模型（MDM）置于仅解码器框架中，公平比较了自回归（AR）和MDM范式，并探讨了架构（仅解码器 vs. 仅编码器）对MDM的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AR和MDM范式时，通常伴随架构差异（仅解码器 vs. 仅编码器），导致难以区分差异来源。研究旨在公平比较范式并分析架构影响。

Method: 将MDM作为任意顺序自回归（AO-AR）置于仅解码器框架中，比较其与标准AR的性能，并研究仅解码器和仅编码器MDM的差异。

Result: 仅解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（约25倍），且困惑度与温度退火相当，尽管建模空间更大。AO-AR目标可能需优化，因其部分排列信息量较低。

Conclusion: 研究解耦了范式与架构的影响，为未来模型设计提供了见解。仅解码器MDM在速度和性能上表现优越。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FedBKD的数据无关蒸馏框架，通过生成对抗网络（GAN）合成数据，实现全局和局部模型之间的双向知识蒸馏，以解决联邦学习中的非独立同分布（non-IID）数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）面临非独立同分布数据的挑战，现有方法难以同时兼顾全局模型的泛化能力和局部模型的性能，且引入公共数据集可能增加数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出FedBKD框架，利用GAN生成合成数据，局部模型作为判别器，参数冻结。合成数据用于全局和局部模型之间的双向知识蒸馏，提升双方性能。

Result: 在4个基准测试中，FedBKD在不同non-IID设置下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FedBKD有效解决了FL中的non-IID数据问题，同时提升了全局和局部模型的性能，且避免了数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究输入敏感性与学习任务难度的关系，探索中等敏感性函数的学习，特别是QR码解码。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行QR码解码实验，分析其学习机制。

Result: Transformer模型能够突破理论纠错限制，泛化到不同语言和随机字符串，且解码机制与传统QR码阅读器不同。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在中等敏感性任务中表现出色，为QR码解码提供了新思路。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Conclusion: 数据编码策略是混合量子-经典模型性能的关键因素，而纯量子模型的性能更依赖于测量协议和编码映射。

Abstract: This study investigates the design choices of parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs) within quantum and hybrid convolutional neural network (HQNN and QCNN)
architectures, applied to the task of satellite image classification using the
EuroSAT dataset. We systematically evaluate the performance implications of
data encoding techniques, variational ans\"atze, and measurement in approx. 500
distinct model configurations. Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of
influence on model performance. For hybrid architectures, which were
benchmarked against their direct classical equivalents (e.g. the same
architecture with the PQCs removed), the data encoding strategy is the dominant
factor, with validation accuracy varying over 30% for distinct embeddings. In
contrast, the selection of variational ans\"atze and measurement basis had a
comparatively marginal effect, with validation accuracy variations remaining
below 5%. For purely quantum models, restricted to amplitude encoding,
performance was most dependent on the measurement protocol and the
data-to-amplitude mapping. The measurement strategy varied the validation
accuracy by up to 30% and the encoding mapping by around 8 percentage points.

Method: 使用FundaQ-8作为结构化评分参考，开发基于ResNet18的回归模型，采用迁移学习、均方误差优化和标准化预处理。

Result: 模型在EyeQ数据集上验证，统计分析和临床应用中表现出可靠性和诊断稳健性提升。

Conclusion: FundaQ-8框架及其深度学习模型在眼底图像质量评估和糖尿病视网膜病变分级中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy
grading also improves diagnostic robustness, highlighting the value of
quality-aware training in real-world screening applications.

Conclusion: VoxelOpt成功平衡了配准精度与运行时间，为变形图像配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度特征融合网络MS-IQA，用于PET/CT图像质量评估，结合高低层特征，并在新数据集上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法无法同时处理高低层特征，导致诊断不确定性，需改进。

Method: 利用ResNet和Swin Transformer的多尺度特征，引入动态加权通道注意力机制融合特征。

Result: 在PET-CT-IQA-DS和LDCTIQAC2023数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-IQA为PET/CT提供了一种高效准确的图像质量评估方法。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) plays a critical
role in medical imaging, combining functional and anatomical information to aid
in accurate diagnosis. However, image quality degradation due to noise,
compression and other factors could potentially lead to diagnostic uncertainty
and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. When evaluating the quality of a PET/CT
image, both low-level features like distortions and high-level features like
organ anatomical structures affect the diagnostic value of the image. However,
existing medical image quality assessment (IQA) methods are unable to account
for both feature types simultaneously. In this work, we propose MS-IQA, a novel
multi-scale feature fusion network for PET/CT IQA, which utilizes multi-scale
features from various intermediate layers of ResNet and Swin Transformer,
enhancing its ability of perceiving both local and global information. In
addition, a multi-scale feature fusion module is also introduced to effectively
combine high-level and low-level information through a dynamically weighted
channel attention mechanism. Finally, to fill the blank of PET/CT IQA dataset,
we construct PET-CT-IQA-DS, a dataset containing 2,700 varying-quality PET/CT
images with quality scores assigned by radiologists. Experiments on our dataset
and the publicly available LDCTIQAC2023 dataset demonstrate that our proposed
model has achieved superior performance against existing state-of-the-art
methods in various IQA metrics. This work provides an accurate and efficient
IQA method for PET/CT. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的深度学习框架，通过自监督学习、混合专家架构和多任务学习，解决了骨质疏松诊断中未标记数据利用不足、设备偏差和临床知识整合不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨质疏松症在资源有限地区诊断受限，现有CT分析方法存在未标记数据利用不足、设备偏差和临床知识整合不足的问题。

Method: 采用自监督学习利用未标记CT数据，混合专家架构增强跨设备适应性，多任务学习整合骨质疏松诊断、BMD回归和椎骨定位预测。

Result: 在三个临床站点和外部医院验证中，该方法表现出优于现有方法的泛化能力和准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为骨质疏松的筛查和诊断提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and
compromised bone microstructure, increases fracture risk in aging populations.
While dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the clinical standard for BMD
assessment, its limited accessibility hinders diagnosis in resource-limited
regions. Opportunistic computed tomography (CT) analysis has emerged as a
promising alternative for osteoporosis diagnosis using existing imaging data.
Current approaches, however, face three limitations: (1) underutilization of
unlabeled vertebral data, (2) systematic bias from device-specific DXA
discrepancies, and (3) insufficient integration of clinical knowledge such as
spatial BMD distribution patterns. To address these, we propose a unified deep
learning framework with three innovations. First, a self-supervised learning
method using radiomic representations to leverage unlabeled CT data and
preserve bone texture. Second, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with
learned gating mechanisms to enhance cross-device adaptability. Third, a
multi-task learning framework integrating osteoporosis diagnosis, BMD
regression, and vertebra location prediction. Validated across three clinical
sites and an external hospital, our approach demonstrates superior
generalizability and accuracy over existing methods for opportunistic
osteoporosis screening and diagnosis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAGLE的U形网络，结合PVSS编码器和HVSS解码器，用于高效准确地分割肝包虫病病灶。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝包虫病在医疗资源有限的牧区广泛流行，现有CNN和Transformer模型在医学图像分割中存在局限性。

Method: 设计了CVSSB模块融合局部和全局特征，HWTB模块实现无损下采样。

Result: EAGLE在Dice相似系数上达到89.76%，优于MSVM-UNet 1.61%。

Conclusion: EAGLE在肝包虫病病灶分割中表现出色，为医疗资源有限地区提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a widespread parasitic disease in
underdeveloped pastoral areas with limited medical resources. While CNN-based
and Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image
segmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,
and Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are
computationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,
have gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear
complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a
Progressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space
(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate
segmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional
Vision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global
features, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses
spatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.
Due to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from
260 patients at a local hospital. Experimental results show that EAGLE achieves
state-of-the-art performance with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
89.76%, surpassing MSVM-UNet by 1.61%.

Conclusion: 该框架为孕龄估计提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound
measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care.
However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the
operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are
demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion
framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement
information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations
from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and
characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of
radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic
features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean
absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current
machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in
diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为加权平均频率（WMF）的新特征，用于改善4D Flow MRI图像的分割效果，显著提升了IoU和Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像分辨率低且噪声多，尤其是壁面剪切应力等生物标志物受血管分割分辨率影响较大，现有PC-MRA方法仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出WMF特征，通过三维可视化揭示脉冲流经过的体素区域，并采用最优阈值和深度学习方法进行分割实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，WMF特征在深度学习中比PC-MRA特征显著提升了IoU（0.12）和Dice（0.13）。

Conclusion: WMF特征有望为心脏或大脑等其他血管区域的分割提供新思路。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种可定制的RAG框架用于医疗任务，其性能优于商业模型且能耗更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在医疗领域应用中的环境和伦理问题，如资源消耗和患者隐私。

Method: 开发了可监控能耗的RAG框架，并基于开源LLMs构建模型，对比商业模型性能。

Result: 自定义RAG模型在准确性和能耗上均优于商业模型，llama3.1:8B表现最佳。

Conclusion: 本地LLMs可开发出高性能、低能耗的RAG模型，符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否会在赋予政治和社会身份后表现出动机性推理，以及这种偏差是否难以通过常规方法消除。

Method: 通过为8种LLMs赋予4类政治和社会身份，测试其在信息真实性辨别和科学证据评估任务中的表现。

Result: 身份赋予使LLMs的真实性辨别能力下降9%，政治身份尤其显著，且传统去偏方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出类似人类的动机性推理，可能加剧身份驱动的判断偏差，需进一步研究应对方法。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

Result: 生成1,162个新设计，其中1,062个通过预训练验证，部分设计在6/9基准测试中优于GPT2和Mamba2。

Conclusion: Genesys系统在自主发现高效LM架构方面具有潜力，遗传编程优于直接提示生成。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）具备代理能力，需要处理复杂的多智能体场景，但目前对ToM和多智能体能力的理解不足，现有基准测试存在局限性。

Method: 提出Decrypto基准测试，结合认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习，设计简单且交互性强。

Result: 前沿LLMs在游戏能力上落后于人类和简单基线，且最新推理模型在ToM任务上表现不如旧模型。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和ToM评估的关键空白，为开发更好的智能代理铺平道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

Conclusion: RSERI-EV框架为电动汽车充电基础设施的韧性评估提供了可行且有效的工具。

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to
sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and
infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce
RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that
combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph
analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV
integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface
temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover
(LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate
a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales
EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest
neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable
neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype
highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial
reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.
