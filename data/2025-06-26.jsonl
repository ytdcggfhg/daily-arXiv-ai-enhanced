In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a\ntwo-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are\nfirst trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B\ntokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay.

The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs\ncan be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in\nmedical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact.

However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to\nbe effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce\nsemi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.\nState-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial\nCNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional\nneural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a\nchallenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to\nfully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to\nconstruct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image\nmodeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with\nmasked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels\nfrom labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked\ndomain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and\ndevise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the\noriginal and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.\nWe also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network.

This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard\nAO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from\nrefinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the\nlanguage's inherent left-to-right structure.

For example, image classification tasks are\ninput-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification\nresults, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently\nattracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects\nto the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick\nResponse (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium\nsensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode\nQR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the\nstructure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to\nother languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the\nTransformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring\nerror-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard\nQR code readers."}

While CNN-based\nand Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image\nsegmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,\nand Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are\ncomputationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,\nhave gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a\nProgressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space\n(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate\nsegmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional\nVision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global\nfeatures, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses\nspatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.\nDue to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from\n260 patients at a local hospital.

Although\nthe research community has made impressive progress in addressing the\nchallenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments\nthat are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene\nunderstanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor\nsettings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a\nmodular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system\nsynthesizes a 360{\\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into\nbackground and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid\ninpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in\nthe virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and\nintuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual\nmock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These\nfeatures make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,\nenabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead\nof traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it\nallows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current\nstate-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,\nDreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view\nsynthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios.

The\nsystem generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each\naccompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate\nanalytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.\n  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term\nmemory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific\nanalytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,\nup-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current\nclinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex\ndiagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We\nevaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional\ndiagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013\ndiseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15\nmethods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other\nagentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing\nthe second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79\npercentage points.

To construct HRIBench, we collected\ndata from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue\nunderstanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four\ndomains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of\n1000 questions for HRIBench.
