Telecommunications\noperation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications\nindustry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,\nand human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified\nservice control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of\nOS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have\nhindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical\nfield. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications\nOperation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this\nbenchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating\nfour key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket\nhandling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To\nsystematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,\nwe categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling\ninto four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic\nNLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we\nleverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10\nopen-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)\nacross diverse scenarios.

As retrieval complexity\nincreases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,\ncurrent RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is\npresented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,\nparticularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This\nraises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect\nmultimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive\nstudy of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled\nexperiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe\na consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To\nquantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and\ndevelop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across\ndecoder layers.

First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by\nthe AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent\nstate-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP\nachieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on\ndisease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion\nprocess comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an\nadaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.\nExperimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy."}

These settings,\ncharacterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure\nrates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for\neffective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce\nAgent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic\nsettings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by\nhuman pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively\nsteers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse\ninformational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to\ndynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate\na teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces\nand promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In\nthe Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce\ninitial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented\nwith agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy\nis updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.\nAgent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%\nto 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified.

Our code is available at https://github.com/violet-42/CM-CGNS", "summary": "Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and\nreports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and\nefficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing\nmodels suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of\nnegative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion\nof false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking\nthe fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition\ntasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but\nignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.\nMotivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal\nCluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image\nReconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features\nobtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.\nThis module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information\ninteraction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for\ndownstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed\nCM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable\nfor various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on\nclassification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream\ndatasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nmultiple metrics, verifying its superior performance."}

Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user\nbehavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and\nperform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well\nrequires training data that captures the diversity across users and\nenvironments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual\ndata generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging\nLarge Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which\nare then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions\nare executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we\nextended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents\nactivities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,\nvirtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.\nAcross five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor\ndata substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are\nlimited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a\nfew days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the\nentire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of\nvirtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,\nwhich is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring\nany manual data collection efforts."}

Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%.

We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly\nincorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes\nintermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model\ntraining. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,\nwhich can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also\nintroduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search\nefficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching\nfrom high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.\nExperiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that\nTreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,\nhighlighting the potential of tree search for LLM.

However, most research is confined to simulation or results\nobtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road\ndeployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a\nlane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and\nBayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking\naction to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our\narchitecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the\nenvironment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into\nlinguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a\npretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model\nto anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into\nlongitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation\ndemonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane\nchange three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient\ntime to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely."}

Drawing on knowledge from a group of\nmedalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,\nexamining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still\nremain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from\nCodeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the\nlikelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every\nproblem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of\nfailed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find\nthat frontier models still have significant limitations: without external\ntools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems\nand 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find\nthat LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced\nalgorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently\nincorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by\nimplementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.\nLiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster\nlevels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in\ncode-centric LLM reasoning."}

In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that\ndirectly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video\nframes as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical\nsystem where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image\naugmentations.

To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema\nlinking model trained using reinforcement learning.

The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen\nto serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical\napplication perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and\ncochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over\ntime, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.\nThe challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic\nsegmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading\nin 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and\nsub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we\nreport the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective\nanalysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the\nsuccessive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers\ndecreases with an expanding dataset.

The winning approach\nof the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing\ndata, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation\nperformance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined\nin 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations\naffecting overall segmentation performance.
