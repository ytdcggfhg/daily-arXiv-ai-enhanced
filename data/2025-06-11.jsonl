Accurate deformation modeling\nis essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment\nbetween preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the\nfinite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high\ncomputational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing\nalgorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced\nby pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical\ncorrespondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we\npropose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy\nwhile improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel\nhuman-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables\nsurgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments,\nthereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt\ndynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available\ndataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration\nerror of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive\nframework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmethods in volumetric accuracy.

In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an\nautonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which\nadopts a three-stage paradigm for training.

Based on the above exploration, we\npropose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge\nDistillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness.\nSpecifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between\ndifferent classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness\ndegree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment\nis managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes.\nAdditionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be\nintegrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of\nrobustness and fairness."}

In this work, we propose a simple but\neffective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware\nconsolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization\nto prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific\nperformance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance\nand preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that\ntask-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass\nmultitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released."}

Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and\nFusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge\nembedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing.\nSpecifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and\nCLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student\nfeatures with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative\npower, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder.\nExtensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS\nPotsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing\napproaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in\nthe majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of\nmulti-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and\nsemantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies\nfurther validate the contribution of each proposed module."}

This\nstrategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model\nto benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches\nare limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory\ndemands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in\n2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures.

Spanning 10\ncountries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts,\n3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over\n10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet\nthe more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging\nexplicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are\nmissed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit\nexpectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while\nimplicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human\njudgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning.\nCollectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable\ndirections for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation\nmethodologies."}

Concept\nreplacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to\n\"erase\" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have\nstarted offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt\nas input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt.

HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and\n5.1 million dynamic $\\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401\ncharacteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential\ndata. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum\non the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that\ntranscend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions,\nwe release $\\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that\nmaps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with\npopular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at\nscale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as\nuniversal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices,\nforging a new algebra-to-graph link.

To our knowledge, no existing method has addressed such a large\nnumber of classes with a comparably lightweight architecture.

To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle\nmOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate\nfull-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in\nrealistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and\nnone have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture\nfine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates\nseparate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level)\ncontexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based\nmodel, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design\nenables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840\npixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of\nclassification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both\nnumerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image\ngeneration, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential\nto enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion\ndetection."}

It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and\nprovably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from\ntranslations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition\nof watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine\ntransformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this\nissue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only\nrequires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary\naffine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the\nmax-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against\nnon-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its\nseparability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nbetween the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance\nonly allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a\nmean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the\nWasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive\nnoise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical\nexperiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well\nas their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise."}
