### [1] [How Significant Are the Real Performance Gains? An Unbiased Evaluation Framework for GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06331)
*Qiming Zeng,Xiao Yan,Hao Luo,Yuhao Lin,Yuxiang Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Bo Du,Quanqing Xu,Jiawei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无偏见的评估框架，用于解决基于知识图谱的检索增强生成（GraphRAG）方法在答案评估中存在的无关问题和评估偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GraphRAG方法的答案评估框架存在无关问题和评估偏见，可能导致对性能的偏颇甚至错误结论。

Method: 提出了一种基于图-文本-问题生成的框架，生成与底层数据集更相关的问题，并采用无偏见的评估程序消除基于LLM的答案评估中的偏见。

Result: 应用该框架评估3种代表性GraphRAG方法，发现其性能提升比之前报道的更为温和。

Conclusion: 尽管该评估框架可能仍有缺陷，但它呼吁科学评估为GraphRAG研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented
generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality
answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and
reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the
current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e.,
unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even
wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an
unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation
to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an
unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer
assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative
GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate
than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have
flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for
GraphRAG research.

### [2] [TESU-LLM: Training Speech-LLMs Without Speech via Unified Encoder Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06343)
*Taesoo Kim,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TESU-LLM是一种仅需文本数据即可训练语音语言模型的新框架，通过统一编码器和轻量级投影网络实现语音推理，性能接近多模态数据训练的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型依赖大规模配对语音-文本数据和计算资源，难以扩展和普及，TESU-LLM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用统一编码器将语义等效的文本和语音输入映射到共享潜在空间，并通过轻量级投影网络对齐LLM的嵌入空间，实现仅文本监督到语音推理的泛化。

Result: TESU-LLM在多个语音相关基准上表现优异，性能接近基于多模态数据训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TESU-LLM提供了一种无需语音数据即可构建语音语言模型的高效、可扩展方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising
results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing
approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive
computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and
accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework
that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our
key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent
text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output
with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we
enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based
inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong
performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline
methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial
computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech
LLMs without speech data.

### [3] [Unified Game Moderation: Soft-Prompting and LLM-Assisted Label Transfer for Resource-Efficient Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06347)
*Zachary Yang,Domenico Tullo,Reihaneh Rabbany*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种软提示方法和LLM辅助标签转移框架，用于解决游戏社区中多游戏和多语言的实时毒性检测问题，显著降低了计算资源和维护成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏社区中的毒性检测在多游戏和多语言环境下面临扩展和实时性的挑战，需要高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 引入软提示方法，使单一模型能处理多游戏；2. 使用GPT-4o-mini开发LLM辅助标签转移框架，扩展至七种语言。

Result: 在法语、德语、葡萄牙语和俄语的游戏聊天数据上，宏F1分数为32.96%至58.88%，德语表现最佳。生产环境中，模型每天平均识别50名违规玩家。

Conclusion: 统一方法显著降低了计算和维护成本，同时保持了高性能，适用于多游戏和多语言环境。

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges
when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time
environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key
findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on
ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we
introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively
handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the
performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering
superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer
framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages.
Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and
Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with
particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of
45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces
computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining
separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model
successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in
sanctionable behavior.

### [4] [Relationship Detection on Tabular Data Using Statistical Analysis and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06371)
*Panagiotis Koletsis,Christos Panagiotopoulos,Georgios Th. Papadopoulos,Vasilis Efthymiou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合方法，利用知识图谱（KG）和统计分析方法，结合大语言模型（LLM）检测无标签表格数据中列间关系（CPA任务）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格解释任务的重要性日益凸显，但现有技术在处理无标签数据时仍面临挑战，因此需要结合KG和LLM提升性能。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合KG和统计分析方法（如领域和范围约束检测、关系共现分析）缩小搜索空间，并利用LLM进行关系检测。

Result: 在SemTab挑战赛的两个基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了不同模块的影响以及不同量化水平和提示技术下LLM的表现。

Conclusion: 所提方法在基准数据集上表现优异，与现有先进方法竞争，且代码已开源。

Abstract: Over the past few years, table interpretation tasks have made significant
progress due to their importance and the introduction of new technologies and
benchmarks in the field. This work experiments with a hybrid approach for
detecting relationships among columns of unlabeled tabular data, using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) as a reference point, a task known as CPA. This approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) while employing statistical analysis to
reduce the search space of potential KG relations. The main modules of this
approach for reducing the search space are domain and range constraints
detection, as well as relation co-appearance analysis. The experimental
evaluation on two benchmark datasets provided by the SemTab challenge assesses
the influence of each module and the effectiveness of different
state-of-the-art LLMs at various levels of quantization. The experiments were
performed, as well as at different prompting techniques. The proposed
methodology, which is publicly available on github, proved to be competitive
with state-of-the-art approaches on these datasets.

### [5] [Enhancing Decision-Making of Large Language Models via Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06376)
*Heng Dong,Kefei Duan,Chongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的Actor-Critic框架LAC，通过长期动作评估改进LLM策略，解决了复杂决策场景中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂决策场景中表现不佳，缺乏长期推理和高层次目标对齐的能力。

Method: LAC框架通过计算Q值提取动作评估，并结合未来轨迹推演和推理，采用无梯度机制实现高效策略改进。

Result: 实验表明，LAC在多种环境中优于现有方法，甚至在7B/8B参数LLM上超越使用GPT-4的基线方法。

Conclusion: LAC展示了将结构化策略优化与LLM内在知识结合的潜力，提升了多步环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural
language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex
decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with
high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term
auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating
rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that
effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a
principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1)
extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits
associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory
rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a
gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including
high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text),
and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves
competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline
methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the
potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic
knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

### [6] [Detection Method for Prompt Injection by Integrating Pre-trained Model and Heuristic Feature Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06384)
*Yi Ji,Runzhi Li,Baolei Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DMPI-PMHFE的双通道特征融合检测框架，用于检测大语言模型中的提示注入攻击，结合预训练语言模型和启发式特征工程，显著提升了检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，提示注入攻击成为重大安全威胁，现有防御机制在效果和泛化性之间存在权衡，亟需高效且通用的检测方法。

Method: 提出DMPI-PMHFE框架，结合DeBERTa-v3-base提取语义向量和启发式规则提取结构特征，通过全连接神经网络融合特征进行预测。

Result: 实验表明，DMPI-PMHFE在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于现有方法，并在主流LLMs中显著降低攻击成功率。

Conclusion: DMPI-PMHFE通过双通道特征融合有效解决了单一依赖预训练模型的局限性，为提示注入攻击检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt
injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing
defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and
generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt
injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To
address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion
detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic
feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the
framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input
text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel,
we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit
structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels
are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to
produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the
limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental
results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms
existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when
deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across
mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

### [7] [Confidence Is All You Need: Few-Shot RL Fine-Tuning of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06395)
*Pengyi Li,Matvey Skripkin,Alexander Zubrey,Andrey Kuznetsov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSC利用模型自身置信度作为奖励信号，无需人工标注或外部奖励模型，显著提升了数学推理任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或外部奖励模型，RLSC旨在减少这些依赖。

Method: 提出RLSC方法，利用模型自身置信度作为奖励信号，应用于Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型。

Result: 在AIME2024、MATH500和AMC23数据集上，准确率分别提升20.10%、49.40%和52.50%。

Conclusion: RLSC是一种简单、可扩展的微调方法，适用于数学推理模型，且仅需极少监督。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains
critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement
learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external
reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC),
which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need
for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 8 samples per question and 4 training epochs, RLSC
improves accuracy by +20.10% on AIME2024, +49.40% on MATH500, and +52.50% on
AMC23. RLSC offers a simple, scalable post-training method for reasoning models
with minimal supervision.

### [8] [Natural Language Interaction with Databases on Edge Devices in the Internet of Battlefield Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06396)
*Christopher D. Molek,Roberto Fronteddu,K. Brent Venable,Niranjan Suri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言处理（NLP）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的解决方案，用于在战场物联网（IoBT）中通过自然语言查询数据库并返回自然语言响应，以提高态势感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战场物联网（IoBT）的扩展为增强态势感知提供了新机会，但需要将设备数据转化为用户可用的信息对象，并实时提供给决策者。

Method: 采用LLMs（如Llama 3.1）和图形数据库，通过两步法将自然语言问题映射为数据库查询（Cypher），并将查询结果以自然语言总结返回。

Result: 实验表明，Llama 3.1（80亿参数）在所有指标上表现最佳，且两步法放松了对查询精确匹配的要求，准确率提高了19.4%。

Conclusion: 该工作流为在边缘设备上部署LLMs奠定了基础，支持通过自然语言与数据库交互，助力关键决策。

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of
Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing
situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational
awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be
processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to
consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes
use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and
return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as
graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which
are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping
questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to
summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate
several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing
publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at
the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion
parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics.
Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach
allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced
Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4%
increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on
edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing
information objects for critical decision making.

### [9] [Direct Behavior Optimization: Unlocking the Potential of Lightweight LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06401)
*Hongming Yang,Shi Lin,Jun Shao,Changting Lin,Donghai Zhu,Meng Han,Qinglei Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBoP是一种直接行为优化范式，专为轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）设计，通过梯度无关的蒙特卡洛树搜索优化执行序列，显著提升其推理能力，并在多项任务中超越GPT-3.5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级大语言模型（LwLLMs）在资源效率和隐私方面有优势，但推理能力有限，现有提示优化方法对其效果不佳。

Method: DeBoP将复杂提示优化转化为离散、可量化的执行序列优化，采用梯度无关的蒙特卡洛树搜索方法。

Result: DeBoP在七项任务中显著优于其他方法，优化后的LwLLMs在多数任务中超越GPT-3.5，计算时间减少约60%。

Conclusion: DeBoP为LwLLMs提供了一种高效的自动优化方法，显著提升了其推理能力和实用性。

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized
models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering
significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data
privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and
reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and
limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization
methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive
abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To
address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior
Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method,
which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In
particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the
optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a
gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging
tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent
prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized
LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by
approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

### [10] [Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs: Psychological and Empirical Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06404)
*Sooyung Choi,Jaehyeok Lee,Xiaoyuan Yi,Jing Yao,Xing Xie,JinYeong Bak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，与人类价值观对齐的大型语言模型（LLMs）可能增加安全风险，因为其生成内容更倾向于对齐的价值观，从而放大有害结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化LLMs的发展，如何确保其与人类价值观对齐的同时避免安全风险成为关键问题。

Method: 通过分析数据集和心理学假设，研究价值对齐LLMs的安全风险及其成因。

Result: 价值对齐LLMs比未微调模型更易产生有害行为，且在传统安全评估中风险略高。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了价值对齐的潜在风险，并提出上下文对齐方法以提升安全性。

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand,
leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human
values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises
significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful
information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with
value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these
challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are
more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit
slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned
models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely
generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful
outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant
correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by
psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of
value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety
of value-aligned LLMs.

### [11] [SMAR: Soft Modality-Aware Routing Strategy for MoE-based Multimodal Large Language Models Preserving Language Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06406)
*Guoyang Xia,Yifeng Ding,Fengfa Li,Lei Ren,Chen Wei,Fangxiang Feng,Xiaojie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SMAR的正则化技术，通过KL散度控制多模态路由概率分布，平衡模态差异与语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态MoE模型训练成本高或语言能力下降的问题。

Method: 使用KL散度正则化技术（SMAR）控制路由概率分布，无需修改模型架构或依赖大量文本数据。

Result: 在视觉指令调优实验中，SMAR保持了86.6%的语言能力（仅需2.5%纯文本），优于基线且多模态性能强。

Conclusion: SMAR为多模态MoE模型提供了一种高效平衡模态差异与语言能力的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling
large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal
tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high
training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting
pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing
(SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence
to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging
expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying
on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR
preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text,
outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our
approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality
differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“规范采样”的方法，解决大语言模型生成非规范标记序列的问题，并证明其生成的序列更接近训练数据的真实分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时可能生成非规范的标记序列，导致负面后果，因此需要一种方法确保生成规范的序列。

Method: 基于理论分析，提出“规范采样”方法，确保模型在自回归生成过程中每一步都生成规范的标记序列。

Result: 规范采样能有效避免非规范序列的生成，且生成的序列分布更接近训练数据的真实分布。

Conclusion: 规范采样是一种简单高效的方法，解决了大语言模型生成非规范序列的问题，并提升了生成质量。

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of
tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the
tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference
as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the
token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the
tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the
canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest
that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,
and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show
that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate
(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive
generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical
result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method
that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.
Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the
distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably
closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

*Kaiser Sun,Fan Bai,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一个诊断框架，评估大语言模型在上下文与参数知识冲突时的行为，发现知识冲突对无需知识的任务影响小，模型更依赖对齐的知识，且无法完全抑制内部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文与参数知识冲突时的行为，以评估其可靠性和部署中的潜在问题。

Method: 构建诊断数据，分析模型在不同任务类型中的表现，包括知识冲突和对齐情况。

Result: 知识冲突对无需知识的任务影响小；模型更依赖对齐的知识；无法完全抑制内部知识；提供冲突解释会增加对上下文的依赖。

Conclusion: 知识冲突影响模型评估的有效性，需在部署中考虑。

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric
knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict,
especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric
knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM
behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information
diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that
elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task
types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on
tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is
consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3)
models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when
instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases
reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of
model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge
conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

### [14] [Improving LLM-Powered EDA Assistants with RAFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06500)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种使用合成Q/A数据集结合RAFT方法提升LLM在EDA领域性能的方案，并探讨了真实用户问题对合成数据生成的影响，同时实施了安全访问控制以保护敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子设计工程师在EDA任务中难以高效获取相关信息，现有开源LLM缺乏领域知识，且RAG方法可能产生不准确回答。

Method: 采用RAFT方法结合合成Q/A数据集增强LLM性能，并研究真实用户问题作为RAFS示例的影响，同时实施安全访问控制。

Result: RAFT结合合成数据显著提升了LLM在RAG-based EDA任务中的表现，并评估了数据泄漏风险。

Conclusion: 合成数据结合RAFT是提升LLM在EDA领域性能的有效方法，需注意数据安全和隐私保护。

Abstract: Electronic design engineers often struggle to efficiently access relevant
information for tasks like design verification and technology development.
While large language models (LLMs) can enhance productivity as conversational
agents, pre-trained open-source LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for
Electronic Design Automation (EDA). In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
context, LLMs rely on external context but may still produce inaccurate
responses. Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) improves LLM performance, but
acquiring labeled question/answer (Q/A) data in EDA is difficult. To address
this, we propose using synthetic Q/A datasets to enhance LLMs with RAFT. Our
results show that RAFT with synthetic data significantly boosts LLM performance
for RAG-based EDA tasks. We also investigate the impact of using real user
questions as Retrieval-Augmented Few-Shot (RAFS) examples for synthetic data
generation. Additionally, we implement secure access control to ensure
sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel. Finally, we
assess the risk of data leakage and unintended memorization during fine-tuning
with synthetic data, providing practical insights.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了偏见传播的普遍性，并呼吁关注模型性能提升可能加剧偏见的问题。

Abstract: To build fair AI systems we need to understand how social-group biases
intrinsic to foundational encoder-based vision-language models (VLMs) manifest
in biases in downstream tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic
biases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into
zero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's
outputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by
correlating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with
(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and
image-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between
intrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\rho$ = 0.83 $\pm$ 0.10. This
pattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six
social groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that
larger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding
that raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.
Our framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation
of group and valence signals. Investigations reveal that underrepresented
groups experience less robust propagation, further skewing their model-related
outcomes.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on
post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction
following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training
datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to
the public, with limited information about their construction process. This
lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source
post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield
performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain
challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them
rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains
unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence
downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open
post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie
framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including
turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and
response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and
qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on
these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data
mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset
while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings
offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training
datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To
support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets
and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出意图幻觉概念，指大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂查询中忽略或误解部分条件。作者引入FAITHQA基准（20,068个问题）评估意图幻觉，并开发CONSTRAINT SCORE自动检测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂查询中部分满足或误解意图的问题，揭示意图幻觉现象。

Method: 提出FAITHQA基准，覆盖多种主题和难度，评估LLMs的意图幻觉；开发CONSTRAINT SCORE自动检测指标。

Result: 发现意图幻觉普遍存在于先进LLMs中，主要由忽略或误解引起；CONSTRAINT SCORE接近人类评估效果。

Conclusion: 意图幻觉是LLMs的常见问题，FAITHQA和CONSTRAINT SCORE为未来研究提供工具。

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large
language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy
the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the
concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit
(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented
query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated
generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce
FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068
problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination
benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the
fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on
FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for
state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or
misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an
automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting
intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT
SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to
baselines.

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap是一个用于个性化图标题生成的多模态数据集，通过提供上下文信息（如图像和相关段落）帮助生成更接近作者风格的标题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成的图标题通常需要作者修改以匹配其风格和领域需求，凸显了个性化的重要性。当前技术多关注纯文本场景，而忽略了多模态输入和配置的需求。

Method: 提出LaMP-Cap数据集，包含目标图的图像及最多三个相关图的图像、标题和提及段落作为上下文配置。实验使用四种大语言模型验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，使用配置信息能显著提升标题生成质量，使其更接近作者原始标题。多模态配置（图像）比纯文本配置（段落）更有效。

Conclusion: LaMP-Cap展示了多模态配置在个性化图标题生成中的优势，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Conclusion: PIC-LM能有效减少幻觉，提升生成信息的精确性，展示了精确生成任务的潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic
hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but
unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose
Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models
to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short
self-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any
unsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests
a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting
that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We
present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,
summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are
supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range
of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,
state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To
alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,
using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B
PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full
PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,
PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and
factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the
potential of precisely grounded generation.

method that generates high-quality citations. Our evaluation highlights the
challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while
identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the
final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation
precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we
show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from
professional experts.

*Charles Goddard,Fernando Fernandes Neto*

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过正交匹配追踪（OMP）重建未见过的词嵌入，实现预训练大语言模型（LLM）中分词器的移植。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在不同分词器之间移植时的性能下降问题，尤其是在数学推理等任务中。

Method: 使用OMP将新分词器的词汇表示为共享锚词符的稀疏线性组合，分两阶段实现嵌入空间的转换。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，OMP在零样本设置下表现最佳，显著优于其他方法（如WECHSEL、FOCUS、ZETT）。

Conclusion: OMP方法无需梯度更新即可有效弥合分词器差异，为跨分词器应用（如知识蒸馏、领域适应）提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained
large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each
out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two
phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding
space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same
sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and
Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of
the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot
approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init,
and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves
the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer
discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies
mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for
preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct
reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating
cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling,
merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method
into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary
realignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型中特征传输的效率和效果，以降低训练成本并比较不同规模模型的表示空间。

Method: 使用仿射映射将稀疏自编码器（SAE）的权重在不同规模模型间传输，并分析特征传输的效果。

Result: 小模型到大模型的SAE传输可节省50%训练成本，且语义和结构特征传输效果不同。

Conclusion: 仿射映射是一种高效的特征传输方法，可显著提升SAE训练效率，同时揭示不同规模模型表示空间的异同。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that affine mappings between residual streams of
language models is a cheap way to effectively transfer represented features
between models. We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their
representations. We find that small and large models learn highly similar
representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs
on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For
example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to
50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show
that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground
truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability,
finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently
while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully
mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the
linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method
for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.

Motivation: 准确且可解释的抑郁语言检测对心理健康早期干预具有重要意义，有助于临床实践和公共卫生。

Method: 比较了零样本LLMs和监督分类器在三种分类任务中的表现，包括二元抑郁分类、抑郁严重程度分类及抑郁、PTSD和焦虑的鉴别诊断。

Result: 零样本LLMs在二元分类中泛化能力强，但在细粒度分类中表现较差；基于LLM摘要嵌入的分类器表现更优。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康预测中具有潜力，未来可优化其零样本能力和上下文感知摘要技术。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable detection of depressive language in social media
is useful for early interventions of mental health conditions, and has
important implications for both clinical practice and broader public health
efforts. In this paper, we investigate the performance of large language models
(LLMs) and traditional machine learning classifiers across three classification
tasks involving social media data: binary depression classification, depression
severity classification, and differential diagnosis classification among
depression, PTSD, and anxiety. Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with
supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and
LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot
LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification,
they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications. In contrast,
classifiers trained on summary embeddings generated by LLMs demonstrate
competitive, and in some cases superior, performance on the classification
tasks, particularly when compared to models using traditional text embeddings.
Our findings demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in mental health prediction, and
suggest promising directions for better utilization of their zero-shot
capabilities and context-aware summarization techniques.

Motivation: 探索法律简报写作这一未被充分研究的领域，帮助法律专业人士更高效地完成工作。

Method: 创建BRIEFME数据集，包含三个任务：论点摘要、论点补全和案例检索，并分析当前语言模型的表现。

Result: 大型语言模型在摘要和引导补全任务上表现优异，但在实际论点补全和案例检索任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: BRIEFME数据集有望推动法律NLP的发展，以更好地支持法律工作。

Abstract: A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the
writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough
understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but
also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new
direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges.
To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce
BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for
language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument
summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we
describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models
perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite
good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating
human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our
benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases.
We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will
specifically aid people in performing legal work.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理咨询中的研究集中于单次会话，而实际心理咨询是一个多会话的渐进过程，需要持续跟踪和适应客户需求。

Method: 利用公开心理案例报告构建多会话心理咨询数据集（MusPsy-Dataset），并开发了能够跟踪客户进展并动态调整咨询方向的MusPsy-Model。

Result: 实验表明，MusPsy-Model在多会话场景中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 论文通过MusPsy-Dataset和MusPsy-Model填补了多会话心理咨询研究的空白，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in automated psychological counseling. However, current research focuses on
single-session counseling, which doesn't represent real-world scenarios. In
practice, psychological counseling is a process, not a one-time event,
requiring sustained, multi-session engagement to progressively address clients'
issues. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dataset for Multi-Session
Psychological Counseling Conversation Dataset (MusPsy-Dataset). Our
MusPsy-Dataset is constructed using real client profiles from publicly
available psychological case reports. It captures the dynamic arc of
counseling, encompassing multiple progressive counseling conversations from the
same client across different sessions. Leveraging our dataset, we also
developed our MusPsy-Model, which aims to track client progress and adapt its
counseling direction over time. Experiments show that our model performs better
than baseline models across multiple sessions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有安全性评估标准的主观性，缺乏明确的法律依据，论文旨在通过法律视角系统评估LLMs的安全性。

Method: 提出SafeLawBench基准，将安全风险分为三级，包含24,860道选择题和1,106道开放域QA任务，评估了2个闭源和18个开源LLMs。

Result: 评估显示，即使是领先的SOTA模型（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4o）在多选题任务中准确率未超过80.5%，20个LLMs的平均准确率为68.8%。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁社区优先研究LLMs的安全性，并发现多数投票机制可提升模型性能。

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs), the safety of
LLMs has raised significant concerns. However, there is still a lack of
definitive standards for evaluating their safety due to the subjective nature
of current safety benchmarks. To address this gap, we conducted the first
exploration of LLMs' safety evaluation from a legal perspective by proposing
the SafeLawBench benchmark. SafeLawBench categorizes safety risks into three
levels based on legal standards, providing a systematic and comprehensive
framework for evaluation. It comprises 24,860 multi-choice questions and 1,106
open-domain question-answering (QA) tasks. Our evaluation included 2
closed-source LLMs and 18 open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, highlighting the safety features of each model. We also evaluated
the LLMs' safety-related reasoning stability and refusal behavior.
Additionally, we found that a majority voting mechanism can enhance model
performance. Notably, even leading SOTA models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
GPT-4o have not exceeded 80.5% accuracy in multi-choice tasks on SafeLawBench,
while the average accuracy of 20 LLMs remains at 68.8\%. We urge the community
to prioritize research on the safety of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction
tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point
estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We
investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs,
addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price
estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification
are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs
to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point
estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction
datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads
significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and
distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for
prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison
of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling
reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures,
embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also
reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving
human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made
available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support

Motivation: 现有方法仅能对语言模型进行点对点控制，限制了其在高层次行为调整中的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出分布级别的干预方法，学习概念子空间及其周围区域的变换，而非仅点对点变换。

Result: 在八个常识推理和七个算术推理基准测试中，分布级别干预在可控性和鲁棒性上均优于点对点干预。

Conclusion: 分布级别干预为语言模型行为提供了更全面的引导方法，实现了更精细的控制。

Abstract: Interventions in language models (LMs) are applied strategically to steer
model behavior during the forward pass. Learnable interventions, also known as
representation fine-tuning, aim to apply pointwise control within the concept
subspace and have proven effective in altering high-level behaviors. In this
work, we extend this approach to the distribution level, enabling the model to
learn not only pointwise transformations but also the surrounding regions of
the concept subspace. We demonstrate that these methods perform effectively in
early layers, with larger standard deviations correlating strongly with
improved performance. Across eight commonsense reasoning and seven arithmetic
reasoning benchmarks, our distribution-wise interventions consistently
outperform pointwise interventions in controllability and robustness. These
results illustrate that distribution-wise interventions provide a more
comprehensive method for steering model behavior and enabling finer-grained
control over language models. The code is at:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了检索增强生成（RAG）的最新研究方向，包括动态RAG和参数化RAG，以解决传统静态检索方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用静态检索和上下文知识注入，难以满足多跳推理和自适应信息访问的需求，因此需要更灵活的方法。

Result: 动态RAG和参数化RAG在效率和效果上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 本文为RAG的未来研究提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational paradigm for
equipping large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, playing a
critical role in information retrieval and knowledge-intensive applications.
However, conventional RAG systems typically adopt a static
retrieve-then-generate pipeline and rely on in-context knowledge injection,
which can be suboptimal for complex tasks that require multihop reasoning,
adaptive information access, and deeper integration of external knowledge.
Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static
retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions,
this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas
on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when
and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time
adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how
retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from
input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and

### [30] [DivScore: Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text in Specialized Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06705)
*Zhihui Chen,Kai He,Yucheng Huang,Yunxiao Zhu,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DivScore框架，通过熵评分和领域知识蒸馏，有效检测专业领域（如医学和法律）中的LLM生成文本，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业和高风险领域检测LLM生成文本对打击错误信息和确保真实性至关重要，但现有零样本检测器在专业内容上表现不佳。

Method: 提出DivScore框架，结合归一化熵评分和领域知识蒸馏，用于检测专业领域的LLM生成文本。

Result: 实验表明DivScore在AUROC和召回率上分别提升14.4%和64.0%，且在对抗环境下表现更优。

Conclusion: DivScore在专业领域检测LLM生成文本方面具有显著优势，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like
medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring
authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general
text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We
provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to
the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To
address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using
normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly
identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a
domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and
legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0%
higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings,
DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on
average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are
publicly available.

*Haiqi Yang,Zhiyuan Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetNet是一种新型神经网络架构，通过保留机制解决了Transformer的高内存消耗和长序列处理问题，实现了线性时间推理和并行训练，并在多个领域表现优异。本文首次全面综述了RetNet的创新、应用及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时存在高内存成本和扩展性问题，RetNet旨在通过保留机制统一递归的归纳偏置和注意力的全局依赖建模，提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: RetNet引入保留机制，结合递归和注意力的优势，实现线性时间推理和并行训练，同时支持长序列的高效建模。

Result: RetNet在自然语言处理、语音识别和时间序列分析等领域表现出色，具有跨域有效性。

Conclusion: 本文填补了RetNet综述的空白，总结了其创新、应用及挑战，并提出了未来研究方向以推动其进一步发展。

Abstract: Retentive Network (RetNet) represents a significant advancement in neural
network architecture, offering an efficient alternative to the Transformer.
While Transformers rely on self-attention to model dependencies, they suffer
from high memory costs and limited scalability when handling long sequences due
to their quadratic complexity. To mitigate these limitations, RetNet introduces
a retention mechanism that unifies the inductive bias of recurrence with the
global dependency modeling of attention. This mechanism enables linear-time
inference, facilitates efficient modeling of extended contexts, and remains
compatible with fully parallelizable training pipelines. RetNet has garnered
significant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain
effectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms
including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series
analysis. However, a comprehensive review of RetNet is still missing from the
current literature. This paper aims to fill that gap by offering the first
detailed survey of the RetNet architecture, its key innovations, and its
diverse applications. We also explore the main challenges associated with
RetNet and propose future research directions to support its continued
advancement in both academic research and practical deployment.

TL;DR: C-PATH是一种基于大型语言模型的对话式AI系统，旨在通过自然对话帮助患者识别症状并推荐合适的医疗科室。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗系统复杂且令人困惑，患者难以获得及时和适当的医疗帮助，因此需要一种用户友好且准确的AI工具。

Method: C-PATH基于LLaMA3架构，通过多阶段管道微调医学知识、对话数据和临床摘要，并采用GPT数据增强框架和可扩展的对话历史管理策略。

Result: 评估显示C-PATH在清晰度、信息量和推荐准确性方面表现优异，显著优于领域特定基线。

Conclusion: C-PATH是数字健康辅助和分诊领域的一项进步，提供了用户友好且准确的AI工具。

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating
barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this
paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in
Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models
(LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending
appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH
is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using
a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of
this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured
clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations,
allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a
scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range
coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across
dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy.
Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in
GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming
domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development
of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health
assistance and triage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在处理具有冲突国家视角的历史事件时是否存在地缘政治偏见，并探索去偏见方法的有效性。

Method: 引入包含中性事件描述和不同国家观点的数据集，通过实验分析模型偏见及去偏见提示的效果。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著的地缘政治偏见，简单去偏见提示效果有限，模型对标签敏感且可能放大偏见。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的国家叙事偏见，挑战了简单去偏见方法的有效性，为未来研究提供了框架和数据集。

Abstract: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various
countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with
conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a
novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from
different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with
models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing
prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with
manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution,
sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with
swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs,
challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a
framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

*Walter Paci,Alessandro Panunzi,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治话语中检测和解释隐含内容的能力，发现当前模型在理解预设和隐含意义方面存在不足，但指出了未来改进的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治话语中隐含内容对观众影响显著，LLMs在语义和语用理解方面表现优异，但其在政治话语中的应用尚未充分研究。

Method: 利用IMPAQTS语料库，通过选择题和开放式生成任务测试LLMs对预设和隐含意义的理解能力。

Result: 所有测试模型在解释预设和隐含意义时表现不佳，显示LLMs缺乏关键语用能力。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs难以准确理解政治话语中的高度隐含语言，但研究为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Implicit content plays a crucial role in political discourse, where speakers
systematically employ pragmatic strategies such as implicatures and
presuppositions to influence their audiences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in tasks requiring complex semantic and
pragmatic understanding, highlighting their potential for detecting and
explaining the meaning of implicit content. However, their ability to do this
within political discourse remains largely underexplored. Leveraging, for the
first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political
speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose
methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through
a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that
all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures. We
conclude that current LLMs lack the key pragmatic capabilities necessary for
accurately interpreting highly implicit language, such as that found in
political discourse. At the same time, we highlight promising trends and future
directions for enhancing model performance. We release our data and code at
https://github.com/WalterPaci/IMPAQTS-PID

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了taggedPBC数据集的CoNLLU格式版本，该版本为超过1,500种语言的句子添加了依存关系标注，并验证了其词序信息的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: taggedPBC数据集虽包含大量语言的POS标注数据，但缺乏依存关系标注，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 通过CoNLLU格式将依存关系信息与POS标签一起迁移到所有语言的句子中。

Result: 尽管标注质量存在一些问题，但数据集中提取的词序信息与专家判定的词序结果一致。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于语料库的类型学方法的潜力，即使数据存在噪声，也能提供有价值的语言学见解。

Abstract: The taggedPBC (Ring 2025a) contains more than 1,800 sentences of pos-tagged
parallel text data from over 1,500 languages, representing 133 language
families and 111 isolates. While this dwarfs previously available resources,
and the POS tags achieve decent accuracy, allowing for predictive
crosslinguistic insights (Ring 2025b), the dataset was not initially annotated
for dependencies. This paper reports on a CoNLLU-formatted version of the
dataset which transfers dependency information along with POS tags to all
languages in the taggedPBC. Although there are various concerns regarding the
quality of the tags and the dependencies, word order information derived from
this dataset regarding the position of arguments and predicates in transitive
clauses correlates with expert determinations of word order in three
typological databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp). This highlights the usefulness
of corpus-based typological approaches (as per Baylor et al. 2023; Bjerva 2024)
for extending comparisons of discrete linguistic categories, and suggests that
important insights can be gained even from noisy data, given sufficient
annotation. The dependency-annotated corpora are also made available for
research and collaboration via GitHub.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在心理修辞中的自主说服和抵抗说服能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估四种LLMs在对抗性对话中的表现，引入11种心理说服策略，并提出基于直接偏好优化的自适应框架。

Result: 实验表明，特定策略（如流畅性效应和重复效应）能显著提升说服成功率，但效果依赖上下文。自适应框架能有效选择最优策略。

Conclusion: 自适应心理说服方法显著提升了LLMs的说服能力，同时保持了其通用能力。

Abstract: Previous work has showcased the intriguing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in instruction-following and rhetorical fluency. However,
systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and
resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric,
remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs
by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial
dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ
repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven
comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly
instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and
Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no
``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance
heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these
observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference
optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by
leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference
pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive
psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select
optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while
maintaining general capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决文本数据爆炸导致的手动分类困难问题，提出一种领域无关的高效分类方法。

Method: 利用预定义标签描述生成模型，结合双目标损失函数（交叉熵损失和余弦相似度），通过微调句子转换器匹配生成描述与预定义标签。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最新最优性能，Micro-F1提升13.94%，Macro-F1提升24.85%。

Conclusion: LAGAMC模型在参数效率和通用性上表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification
increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient
domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification.
Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes
predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions
based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are
matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We
integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy
loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined
target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our
proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility
across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new
state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several
strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in
Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

TL;DR: 语言模型在区分可能事件与不可能事件的能力上表现不佳，甚至在某些情况下表现低于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能可靠地区分可能事件与不可能事件，并分析其表现。

Method: 通过分离可能性、典型性和上下文相关性，测试多种语言模型（如Llama 3、Gemma 2、Mistral NeMo）的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型在某些条件下表现低于随机水平，甚至对不可能句子赋予更高概率。

Conclusion: 语言模型在区分可能事件与不可能事件的能力上存在显著缺陷，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely
than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and
contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work,
language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain
conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo -
perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to
impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake'
than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket
by the explorer'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏同时控制问题难度和叙事的方法，而这对教育用途的问题生成至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种联合叙事和难度控制的策略，用于同时控制生成问题的这两个属性。

Result: 初步证据表明该方法可行，但并非在所有情况下都有效。

Conclusion: 研究明确了策略表现良好的条件，并讨论了其应用的权衡。

Abstract: Question Generation (QG), the task of automatically generating questions from
a source input, has seen significant progress in recent years.
Difficulty-controllable QG (DCQG) enables control over the difficulty level of
generated questions while considering the learner's ability. Additionally,
narrative-controllable QG (NCQG) allows control over the narrative aspects
embedded in the questions. However, research in QG lacks a focus on combining
these two types of control, which is important for generating questions
tailored to educational purposes. To address this gap, we propose a strategy
for Joint Narrative and Difficulty Control, enabling simultaneous control over
these two attributes in the generation of reading comprehension questions. Our
evaluation provides preliminary evidence that this approach is feasible, though
it is not effective across all instances. Our findings highlight the conditions
under which the strategy performs well and discuss the trade-offs associated
with its application.

Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing
public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and
computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such
research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced
languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we
present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse
(BTPD) collected from three online platforms, each representing distinct
community structures and interaction dynamics. Besides describing how we
hand-curated the dataset through community-informed keyword-based retrieval,
this paper also provides a general overview of its topics and multilingual
content.

Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit
identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically
marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts.
While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support
are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests
the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and
nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced
language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built
on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment
analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that
BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having
similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies
and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets
created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these
findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and
methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.

Motivation: 现有方法将情感理解视为分类问题，缺乏对预测背后逻辑的解释。本文旨在通过情感推理提升AudioLLMs在情感识别中的表现。

Method: 提出统一框架，结合推理增强的数据监督、双编码器架构和任务交替训练，使AudioLLMs能有效学习多任务并融入情感推理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅提高了情感预测准确性，还增强了生成响应的连贯性和证据基础。

Conclusion: 通过情感推理和多任务框架，AudioLLMs在情感识别任务中表现更优，且生成的解释更具逻辑性。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in
semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in
modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat
emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into
the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion
reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs
to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned,
evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we
introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision,
dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables
AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional
reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only
improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and
evidential grounding of the generated responses.

Motivation: 探索LLM在代码检查和调试中的应用潜力，特别是在竞赛级编程中生成测试用例生成器的能力。

Method: 提出TCGBench基准，包含两项任务：生成有效测试用例生成器和针对性测试用例生成器。实验评估了多种LLM的表现，并构建了高质量的手动标注数据集。

Result: LLM能生成有效测试用例生成器，但在针对性测试用例生成任务中表现不如人类。使用手动标注数据集能提升LLM性能。

Conclusion: LLM在生成针对性测试用例方面仍有局限，但通过数据集辅助（如提示和微调）可提升其表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However,
the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through
test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem
from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose
TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This
benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in
(1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further
(2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written
code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can
generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to
generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively.
Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly
short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators.
Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of
instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the
performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both
prompting and fine-tuning.

Motivation: 心理学研究表明，了解说服谬误有助于识别虚假信息，受此启发，研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否也能通过说服知识提升检测能力。

Method: 提出了Persuasion-Augmented Chain of Thought (PCoT)方法，利用说服知识增强零样本分类中的虚假信息检测。

Result: 在五个LLMs和五个数据集上的实验表明，PCoT平均优于竞争方法15%，并发布了两个新数据集EUDisinfo和MultiDis。

Conclusion: 研究证明了说服知识在提升零样本虚假信息检测中的价值。

Abstract: Disinformation detection is a key aspect of media literacy. Psychological
studies have shown that knowledge of persuasive fallacies helps individuals
detect disinformation. Inspired by these findings, we experimented with large
language models (LLMs) to test whether infusing persuasion knowledge enhances
disinformation detection. As a result, we introduce the Persuasion-Augmented
Chain of Thought (PCoT), a novel approach that leverages persuasion to improve
disinformation detection in zero-shot classification. We extensively evaluate
PCoT on online news and social media posts. Moreover, we publish two novel,
up-to-date disinformation datasets: EUDisinfo and MultiDis. These datasets
enable the evaluation of PCoT on content entirely unseen by the LLMs used in
our experiments, as the content was published after the models' knowledge
cutoffs. We show that, on average, PCoT outperforms competitive methods by 15%
across five LLMs and five datasets. These findings highlight the value of
persuasion in strengthening zero-shot disinformation detection.

TL;DR: Trans-PEFT是一种新方法，通过专注于任务特定模式并减少对基础模型知识的依赖，解决了PEFT模块在基础模型更新后性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型更新后，PEFT模块性能显著下降，重新调整这些模块计算成本高。

Method: 分析基础模型更新变化，发现持续训练主要影响FFN中的任务特定知识，而对注意力机制影响较小。提出Trans-PEFT，专注于任务特定模式。

Result: 在7个基础模型和12个数据集上的实验表明，Trans-PEFT无需重新调整即可在更新后的模型上保持性能。

Conclusion: Trans-PEFT显著降低了实际应用中的维护开销。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for
fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users
through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require
periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous
versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.
Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant
computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur
during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual
training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward
Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the
Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel
approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern
while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further
theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base
models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain
performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing
maintenance overhead in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文揭示了LLMs在数学问题解决中答案正确但推理过程不严谨的问题，提出新数据集MathOlympiadEval和方法ParaStepVerifier，显著提升了识别推理错误的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在数学问题中常通过不严谨的推理获得正确答案，掩盖了奖励黑客现象，现有方法难以可靠检测这些推理缺陷。

Method: 提出ParaStepVerifier方法，通过细致的逐步验证数学解决方案，识别错误的推理步骤。

Result: ParaStepVerifier显著提高了识别复杂多步问题中推理错误的准确性。

Conclusion: ParaStepVerifier为评估和训练具有真正数学推理能力的LLMs提供了更可靠的路径。

Abstract: Outcome-rewarded Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in mathematical problem-solving. However, this success often masks a
critical issue: models frequently achieve correct answers through fundamentally
unsound reasoning processes, a phenomenon indicative of reward hacking. We
introduce MathOlympiadEval, a new dataset with fine-grained annotations, which
reveals a significant gap between LLMs' answer correctness and their low
process correctness. Existing automated methods like LLM-as-a-judge struggle to
reliably detect these reasoning flaws. To address this, we propose
ParaStepVerifier, a novel methodology for meticulous, step-by-step verification
of mathematical solutions. ParaStepVerifier identifies incorrect reasoning
steps. Empirical results demonstrate that ParaStepVerifier substantially
improves the accuracy of identifying flawed solutions compared to baselines,
especially for complex, multi-step problems. This offers a more robust path
towards evaluating and training LLMs with genuine mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态混合方法，结合小模型和LLM的概率分布，提升中文拼写检查任务的性能，无需微调LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在中文拼写检查任务中表现不佳，而微调BERT模型存在编辑模式过拟合问题。

Method: 在beam search解码阶段动态混合小模型和LLM的概率分布，平衡精确性和流畅性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了纠错能力，在多个数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 动态混合方法有效结合了小模型和LLM的优势，节省资源并提升性能。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), the Chinese Spelling Check (CSC)
task has seen various LLM methods developed, yet their performance remains
unsatisfactory. In contrast, fine-tuned BERT-based models, relying on
high-quality in-domain data, show excellent performance but suffer from edit
pattern overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that
effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs
during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of
precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach
also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and
resources, and facilitating domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our mixture approach significantly boosts error correction
capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zhqiao-nlp/MSLLM.

*Hamid Mojarad,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非洲裔美国英语（AAE）中的辅音簇缩减（CCR）和ING缩减对自动语音识别（ASR）错误率的影响，并比较了有无语言模型（LM）的端到端ASR系统的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AAE的语音、音系和形态句法特征常导致ASR模型识别困难，研究旨在量化CCR和ING缩减对ASR错误率的影响，并分析LM对系统表现的作用。

Method: 使用CORAAL语料库，通过wav2vec 2.0（有/无LM）进行转录，利用Montreal Forced Aligner（MFA）检测CCR和ING缩减。

Result: CCR和ING缩减对词错误率（WER）有显著但较小的影响；无LM的ASR系统更易受词汇邻域效应影响。

Conclusion: AAE的语音特征对ASR性能有影响，无LM的系统在词汇邻域效应上表现更明显。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often struggle with the phonetic,
phonological, and morphosyntactic features found in African American English
(AAE). This study focuses on two key AAE variables: Consonant Cluster Reduction
(CCR) and ING-reduction. It examines whether the presence of CCR and
ING-reduction increases ASR misrecognition. Subsequently, it investigates
whether end-to-end ASR systems without an external Language Model (LM) are more
influenced by lexical neighborhood effect and less by contextual predictability
compared to systems with an LM. The Corpus of Regional African American
Language (CORAAL) was transcribed using wav2vec 2.0 with and without an LM. CCR
and ING-reduction were detected using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) with
pronunciation expansion. The analysis reveals a small but significant effect of
CCR and ING on Word Error Rate (WER) and indicates a stronger presence of
lexical neighborhood effect in ASR systems without LMs.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for multilingual sentiment analysis that
combines extractive and abstractive summarization to address the limitations of
standalone methods. The model integrates TF-IDF-based extraction with a
fine-tuned XLM-R abstractive module, enhanced by dynamic thresholding and
cultural adaptation. Experiments across 10 languages show significant
improvements over baselines, achieving 0.90 accuracy for English and 0.84 for

Result: 人工和自动评估均显示该方法在保持叙事忠实度和结构要求方面有效。

Conclusion: 结合语篇结构的摘要方法能更好地满足新闻文章的多平台需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in text summarization have predominantly leveraged large
language models to generate concise summaries. However, language models often
do not maintain long-term discourse structure, especially in news articles,
where organizational flow significantly influences reader engagement. We
introduce a novel approach to integrating discourse structure into
summarization processes, focusing specifically on news articles across various
media. We present a novel summarization dataset where news articles are
summarized multiple times in different ways across different social media
platforms (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.). We develop a novel news discourse
schema to describe summarization structures and a novel algorithm, DiscoSum,
which employs beam search technique for structure-aware summarization, enabling
the transformation of news stories to meet different stylistic and structural
demands. Both human and automatic evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in maintaining narrative fidelity and meeting structural
requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，提示成为人机交互的关键，但缺乏对自然语言提示的量化共识。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过元分析150多篇论文，提出包含21个属性的六维框架评估提示质量，并分析其对LLM的影响。进一步研究多属性提示增强在推理任务中的效果。

Result: 单属性增强对推理任务影响最大；基于属性增强提示的指令调优能提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 本文为提示评估和优化奠定了基础，为人机交互和提示研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have progressed towards more human-like and
human--AI communications have become prevalent, prompting has emerged as a
decisive component. However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what
exactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this
question by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150
prompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025
and blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating
prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We
then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their
imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.
Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural
language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically
explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that
single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we
discover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in
better reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for
property-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between
human--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集如NeuBAROCO和JFLD主要关注通用或信念一致的推理，而BIS Reasoning 1.0填补了信念不一致推理的空白，以评估LLMs在高风险领域中的可靠性。

Method: 通过设计逻辑有效但信念不一致的三段论问题，对GPT、Claude及领先日语LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，准确率为79.54%，但所有模型在处理信念冲突输入时均存在显著弱点。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在逻辑与信念冲突时的局限性，对法律、医疗等高风险领域的应用提出了警示。

Abstract: We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of
syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate
belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior
datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned
reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent
syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned
corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude
models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in
performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies
critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but
belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific
literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and
safety.

Motivation: 提升问答代理的交互能力，使其能主动提出澄清问题以更准确地回答问题。

Conclusion: 离线RL目标是一种有效且实用的方法，可显著提升问答代理的性能。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) agents automatically answer questions posed in
natural language. In this work, we learn to ask clarifying questions in QA
agents. The key idea in our method is to simulate conversations that contain
clarifying questions and learn from them using reinforcement learning (RL). To
make RL practical, we propose and analyze offline RL objectives that can be
viewed as reward-weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and easily optimized in
large language models. Our work stands in a stark contrast to recently proposed
methods, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional
hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize rewards. We compare to these
methods empirically and report gains in both optimized rewards and language
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事件在语言中的终结性和完成性，提供一个形式化的分析工具。

Method: 框架分为名词域和动词域两部分：名词域建模名词短语的有界性及其与子类型、限定数量和形容词修饰的关系；动词域定义依赖事件演算，建模终结事件和完成事件，并考虑副词修饰。

Result: 框架基于扩展的Martin-Löf依赖类型理论，并在Agda证明助手中形式化。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语言事件分析提供了形式化工具，适用于建模和验证语言现象。

Abstract: We present a dependently-typed cross-linguistic framework for analyzing the
telicity and culminativity of events, accompanied by examples of using our
framework to model English sentences. Our framework consists of two parts. In
the nominal domain, we model the boundedness of noun phrases and its
relationship to subtyping, delimited quantities, and adjectival modification.
In the verbal domain we define a dependent event calculus, modeling telic
events as those whose undergoer is bounded, culminating events as telic events
that achieve their inherent endpoint, and consider adverbial modification. In
both domains we pay particular attention to associated entailments. Our
framework is defined as an extension of intensional Martin-L\"of dependent type
theory, and the rules and examples in this paper have been formalized in the
Agda proof assistant.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅依赖浅层统计模式。

Method: 通过语义忠实但对抗性的提示扰动（如故事重构、无关约束注入、示例重排和数值扰动）评估LLMs的推理鲁棒性。

Result: 某些扰动导致性能显著下降（准确率下降高达42.1%），而另一些则意外提升准确率（高达35.3%），表明模型对提示的表面动态敏感。

Conclusion: 当前推理系统存在脆弱性和不可预测性，需更原则性的方法提升推理对齐和提示鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks
requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem
solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens
and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models
truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this
paper, we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by
introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured
prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations
derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as
storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering,
and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely
degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly
improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to
semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the
fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the
need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting
robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to
promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 科学文本的复杂性和高信息密度可能导致非专家误解，现有验证模型在细粒度推理上表现不足。

Method: 提出技能链模式，动态组合模块化原子技能以减少认知负荷，并创建SciAtomicBench基准进行验证。

Result: 仅用350个微调样本，模型表现优于GPT-4o的思维链方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 模块化推理方法能有效提升科学声明验证的准确性和泛化能力，减少认知负荷。

Abstract: Scientific texts often convey authority due to their technical language and
complex data. However, this complexity can sometimes lead to the spread of
misinformation. Non-experts are particularly susceptible to misleading claims
based on scientific tables due to their high information density and perceived
credibility. Existing table claim verification models, including
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), often struggle with precise
fine-grained reasoning, resulting in errors and a lack of precision in
verifying scientific claims. Inspired by Cognitive Load Theory, we propose that
enhancing a model's ability to interpret table-based claims involves reducing
cognitive load by developing modular, reusable reasoning components (i.e.,
atomic skills). We introduce a skill-chaining schema that dynamically composes
these skills to facilitate more accurate and generalizable reasoning with a
reduced cognitive load. To evaluate this, we create SciAtomicBench, a
cross-domain benchmark with fine-grained reasoning annotations. With only 350
fine-tuning examples, our model trained by atomic reasoning outperforms
GPT-4o's chain-of-thought method, achieving state-of-the-art results with far
less training data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due
to insufficient in-depth insights in their training data, which are typically
absent in publicly available documents. This paper introduces the Chain of
Methodologies (CoM), an innovative and intuitive prompting framework that
enhances structured thinking by integrating human methodological insights,
enabling LLMs to tackle complex tasks with extended reasoning. CoM leverages
the metacognitive abilities of advanced LLMs, activating systematic reasoning
throught user-defined methodologies without explicit fine-tuning. Experiments
show that CoM surpasses competitive baselines, demonstrating the potential of
training-free prompting methods as robust solutions for complex reasoning tasks
and bridging the gap toward human-level reasoning through human-like

Motivation: 现有隐喻处理研究多基于英语数据，存在西方文化偏见，影响模型性能和NLP公平性。

Method: 引入MultiMM数据集（8,461对中英文广告文本-图像）和SEMD模型（结合情感嵌入）。

Result: 实验证明SEMD在隐喻检测和情感分析任务中有效。

Conclusion: 该研究提升了NLP中对文化偏见的认识，促进了更公平、包容的语言模型发展。

Abstract: Metaphors are pervasive in communication, making them crucial for natural
language processing (NLP). Previous research on automatic metaphor processing
predominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which
often reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can
lead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP
progress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,
particularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset
designed for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM
consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by
fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal
metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose
Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates
sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural
backgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on
metaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks. We hope this work increases
awareness of cultural bias in NLP research and contributes to the development
of fairer and more inclusive language models. Our dataset and code are

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中会产生冗长的思维链，导致推理速度下降和过度思考现象。研究旨在理解LRMs与非推理模型的差异，并提出高效解决方案。

Method: 提出FoReaL-Decoding方法，结合主导模型和草稿模型，通过随机门控机制动态切换模型，减少冗余计算。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，FoReaL-Decoding减少了30-50%的理论FLOPs和40%的思维链长度，同时保持86-100%的性能。

Conclusion: FoReaL-Decoding是一种简单、即插即用的方法，可在推理任务中实现成本与性能的可控权衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong reasoning performance by
emitting long chains of thought. Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference
and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon.
To better understand LRMs' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level
misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected
that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs
uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global
Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists
or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local
Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking
cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the
sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose
FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for
cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few
tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following
tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to
smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular
math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23),
FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by
up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance. These results
establish FoReaL-Decoding as a simple, plug-and-play route to controllable
cost-quality trade-offs in reasoning-centric tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Adversarial Paraphrasing的攻击框架，利用现成的LLM在AI文本检测器的指导下对AI生成文本进行改写，显著降低了检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升，AI生成文本的滥用问题日益严重，现有检测器对简单改写攻击的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用指令跟随的LLM在检测器指导下改写AI生成文本，生成对抗样本以绕过检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种检测系统上均显著降低检测率（平均T@1%F减少87.88%），且文本质量下降较小。

Conclusion: 该攻击框架揭示了当前检测策略的脆弱性，呼吁开发更鲁棒的检测方法以应对日益复杂的规避技术。

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised
concerns about their misuse in AI-generated plagiarism and social engineering.
While various AI-generated text detectors have been proposed to mitigate these
risks, many remain vulnerable to simple evasion techniques such as
paraphrasing. However, recent detectors have shown greater robustness against
such basic attacks. In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a
training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text
to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf
instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance
of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically
optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is
both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection
systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which,
ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57%
on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on
Fast-DetectGPT. Across a diverse set of detectors--including neural
network-based, watermark-based, and zero-shot approaches--our attack achieves
an average T@1%F reduction of 87.88% under the guidance of
OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large. We also analyze the tradeoff between text quality and
attack success to find that our method can significantly reduce detection
rates, with mostly a slight degradation in text quality. Our adversarial setup
highlights the need for more robust and resilient detection strategies in the
light of increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ViMUL-Bench，一个多语言视频LMM基准测试，旨在评估14种语言的视频理解能力，并提出了ViMUL模型和大型多语言视频训练集，以促进文化及语言包容性研究。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型（LMMs）主要集中在英语，缺乏对其他语言和文化包容性的研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，推动多语言视频LMM的发展。

Method: 提出ViMUL-Bench基准测试，涵盖14种语言和15个文化多样性类别，包含8k手动验证样本；同时开发ViMUL模型和1.2百万样本的多语言训练集。

Result: ViMUL模型在高资源和低资源语言之间取得了更好的平衡，提升了视频理解能力。

Conclusion: ViMUL-Bench、ViMUL模型及训练集的发布将促进未来多语言视频LMM的研究，实现更高的文化和语言包容性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their
effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most
existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore
multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the
English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be
investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video
LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to
evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource
languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian,
Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is
designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight
culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods
and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities.
ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice
questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k
samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we
also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising
1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL,
that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource
languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual
video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help
ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive
multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data
will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Motivation: 传统咨询模式周期长且依赖专家经验，难以满足快速发展的技术需求。

Method: 采用LoRA微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，构建包含13,906实体和13,524关系的知识图谱，结合RAG框架优化问答效果。

Result: BLEU-4从18.8564提升至66.8993，ROUGE等指标显著提高，问答准确率提升2.26%。

Conclusion: 系统在交互体验和后端接入方面表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The
traditional consulting model has a long cycle and relies on the knowledge and
experience of experts, making it difficult to meet the rapidly developing
technological demands. This paper combines the fine-tuning of large language
models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建历史事件的计算表示成本高，且现有RDF/OWL推理器无法支持更深层次的时空和语义分析。

Method: 使用多种LLM（GPT-4、Claude、Llama 3.2）和三种增强策略（基础生成、知识图谱增强、RAG），并在Thucydides的历史文本上评估。

Result: 增强策略在不同性能维度上优化：基础生成在覆盖范围上表现最佳，RAG提升精确性；模型架构影响增强效果。

Conclusion: 通过Coq验证，RAG提取的事件类型具有领域特异性语义结构，支持高阶推理。

Abstract: Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.

Result: Lingshu在多项医学任务中优于现有开源多模态模型。

Conclusion: Lingshu通过改进数据与训练策略，显著提升了医学MLLMs的性能，为医学AI应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their
large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their
effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent
discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the
general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical
limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2)
heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation
processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical
scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data
curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data
not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and
general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual
question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a
multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the
curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu
undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its
task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the
potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm
to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop
MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal
and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model
assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical
tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results
show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal
models on most tasks ...

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在简单常识推理上表现优异，但在复杂和隐式常识推理上表现不佳，而后者对人类更为重要。

Method: 结合因果事件图作为结构化复杂常识，利用因果理论（如干预）修改因果图以生成不同场景，并通过LLM的慢思考合成示例。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在推理深度和广度上存在困难，但后训练和慢思考可以缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: Com$^2$基准测试为复杂常识推理提供了新方向，并展示了改进LLMs推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit
commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like
performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to
reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from
simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an
aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like
math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to
its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with
real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com$^2$ focusing on complex
commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as
structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory~(e.g.,
intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios
that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples
with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the
modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a
more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth
and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code

Result: 在三个情感计算任务中表现优于基线模型和现有最佳模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态情感计算中的信息融合问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal affective computing aims to automatically recognize and interpret
human attitudes from diverse data sources such as images and text, thereby
enhancing human-computer interaction and emotion understanding. Existing
approaches typically rely on unimodal analysis or straightforward fusion of
cross-modal information that fail to capture complex and conflicting evidence
presented across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel
LLM-based approach for affective computing that explicitly deconstructs visual
and textual representations into shared (modality-invariant) and
modality-specific components. Specifically, our approach firstly encodes and
aligns input modalities using pre-trained multi-modal encoders, then employs a
representation decomposition framework to separate common emotional content
from unique cues, and finally integrates these decomposed signals via an
attention mechanism to form a dynamic soft prompt for a multi-modal LLM.
Extensive experiments on three representative tasks for affective computing,
namely, multi-modal aspect-based sentiment analysis, multi-modal emotion
analysis, and hateful meme detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art
models.

Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中常产生冗长且冗余的推理痕迹，导致高推理成本和实际部署受限。现有方法在评估效率提升方面存在不一致性。

Method: 论文提出了推理效率前沿和REG指标，并开发了REO-RL算法，通过强化学习在稀疏的token预算下最小化REG。

Result: 实验表明，REO-RL能将REG降低50%以上，并在16K token预算下接近Qwen3-4B/8B的效率前沿，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 论文表明，通过REG指标和REO-RL算法可以有效提升LRMs的推理效率，但完全对齐效率前沿仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving
capabilities through extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning but often
produce excessively verbose and redundant reasoning traces. This inefficiency
incurs high inference costs and limits practical deployment. While existing
fine-tuning methods aim to improve reasoning efficiency, assessing their
efficiency gains remains challenging due to inconsistent evaluations. In this
work, we introduce the reasoning efficiency frontiers, empirical upper bounds
derived from fine-tuning base LRMs across diverse approaches and training
configurations. Based on these frontiers, we propose the Reasoning Efficiency
Gap (REG), a unified metric quantifying deviations of any fine-tuned LRMs from
these frontiers. Systematic evaluation on challenging mathematical benchmarks
reveals significant gaps in current methods: they either sacrifice accuracy for
short length or still remain inefficient under tight token budgets. To reduce
the efficiency gap, we propose REO-RL, a class of Reinforcement Learning
algorithms that minimizes REG by targeting a sparse set of token budgets.
Leveraging numerical integration over strategically selected budgets, REO-RL
approximates the full efficiency objective with low error using a small set of
token budgets. Through systematic benchmarking, we demonstrate that our
efficiency metric, REG, effectively captures the accuracy-length trade-off,
with low-REG methods reducing length while maintaining accuracy. Our approach,
REO-RL, consistently reduces REG by >=50 across all evaluated LRMs and matching
Qwen3-4B/8B efficiency frontiers under a 16K token budget with minimal accuracy
loss. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our exponential token
budget strategy. Finally, our findings highlight that fine-tuning LRMs to
perfectly align with the efficiency frontiers remains an open challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言推理任务中表现优异，但其推理过程脆弱且难以解释。现有方法（如Chain-of-Thought）缺乏逻辑结构和内部一致性评估机制。

Method: ToTh框架通过三个并行代理（分别模拟溯因、演绎和归纳推理）生成推理轨迹，构建形式化推理图，并利用贝叶斯信念传播和自然语言推理（NLI）评估一致性。

Result: 在符号推理（WebOfLies）和数值推理（MultiArith）任务中，ToTh显著优于Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding，同时生成可解释且逻辑严密的推理链。

Conclusion: ToTh为构建更鲁棒且受认知启发的LLM推理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language reasoning tasks, yet their reasoning processes remain brittle and
difficult to interpret. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating
multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure
and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a
novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel
agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and
inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a
formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief
propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence
scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final
answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith)
reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT,
Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing
interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a
promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM
reasoning. The implementation is available at

Abstract: This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business,
education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with
AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to
"think step by step" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for
improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture
of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things:
  - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending
on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves
average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not
inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can
introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors
in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many
recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these
models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally
requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers.
  - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting
often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it
significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据增强和微调策略有效提升了模型在ACSA任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is an effective approach to addressing data
scarcity in low-resource scenarios. Recent existing research designs
hand-crafted prompts to guide LLM for data augmentation. We introduce a data
augmentation strategy for the aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) task
that preserves the original sentence semantics and has linguistic diversity,
specifically by providing a structured prompt template for an LLM to generate
predefined content. In addition, we employ a post-processing technique to
further ensure semantic consistency between the generated sentence and the
original sentence. The augmented data increases the semantic coverage of the
training distribution, enabling the model better to understand the relationship
between aspect categories and sentiment polarities, enhancing its inference
capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-weighted fine-tuning
strategy to encourage the model to generate more confident and accurate
sentiment polarity predictions. Compared with powerful and recent works, our
method consistently achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets
over all baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法为需要精确句法控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the syntactic structure of text generated by language models is
valuable for applications requiring clarity, stylistic consistency, or
interpretability, yet it remains a challenging task. In this paper, we argue
that sampling algorithms based on the posterior inference can effectively
enforce a target constituency structure during generation. Our approach
combines sequential Monte Carlo, which estimates the posterior distribution by
sampling from a proposal distribution, with a syntactic tagger that ensures
that each generated token aligns with the desired syntactic structure. Our
experiments with GPT2 and Llama3-8B models show that with an appropriate
proposal distribution, we can improve syntactic accuracy, increasing the F1
score from $12.31$ (GPT2-large) and $35.33$ (Llama3-8B) to about $93$ in both
cases without compromising the language model's fluency. These results
underscore both the complexity of syntactic control and the effectiveness of
sampling algorithms, offering a promising approach for applications where
precise control over syntax is essential.

Result: GeometryZero在多个几何基准测试中平均提升4.29%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCPO框架有效解决了几何推理中的辅助构造问题，为小型模型的高效训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning,
amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary
construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve
suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring
massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training
smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust
geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning
presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional
rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary
constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy
Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key
innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive
or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual
utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains.
Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size
geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary
construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric
benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models
consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement
of 4.29% across all benchmarks.

Abstract: Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule
of more: more data, more computing power and more complexity, best exemplified
by the Large Language Models. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense
models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of
computing resources. This \textbf{Ph.D. dissertation} focuses on an
under-investi\-gated NLP data engineering technique, whose potential is
enormous in the current scenario known as Instance Selection (IS). The IS goal
is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances
while maintaining the effectiveness of the trained models and reducing the
training process cost. We provide a comprehensive and scientifically sound
comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task -- Automatic Text
Classification (ATC), considering several classification solutions and many
datasets. Our findings reveal a significant untapped potential for IS
solutions. We also propose two novel IS solutions that are noise-oriented and
redundancy-aware, specifically designed for large datasets and transformer
architectures. Our final solution achieved an average reduction of 41\% in
training sets, while maintaining the same levels of effectiveness in all
datasets. Importantly, our solutions demonstrated speedup improvements of 1.67x
(up to 2.46x), making them scalable for datasets with hundreds of thousands of

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，其训练数据中可能包含敏感、受版权保护或非法内容，引发了选择性移除信息的需求。现有方法存在响应不自然、泛化能力差或性能损失等问题。

Method: RULE将遗忘任务建模为拒绝边界优化问题，使用少量遗忘数据和合成边界查询进行训练，并通过可验证的奖励函数实现安全拒绝和保留有用响应。

Result: 实验表明，RULE仅需12%的遗忘数据和8%的合成数据，即可在遗忘质量和响应自然度上优于现有基线17.5%和16.3%，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: RULE不仅实现了目标遗忘，还提升了输出自然度和训练效率，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive,
uncurated corpora has raised growing concerns about the inclusion of sensitive,
copyrighted, or illegal content. This has led to increasing interest in LLM
unlearning: the task of selectively removing specific information from a model
without retraining from scratch or degrading overall utility. However, existing
methods often rely on large-scale forget and retain datasets, and suffer from
unnatural responses, poor generalization, or catastrophic utility loss. In this
work, we propose Reinforcement UnLearning (RULE), an efficient framework that
formulates unlearning as a refusal boundary optimization problem. RULE is
trained with a small portion of the forget set and synthesized boundary
queries, using a verifiable reward function that encourages safe refusal on
forget--related queries while preserving helpful responses on permissible
inputs. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating the
effectiveness of RULE in achieving targeted unlearning without compromising
model utility. Experimental results show that, with only $12%$ forget set and
$8%$ synthesized boundary data, RULE outperforms existing baselines by up to
$17.5%$ forget quality and $16.3%$ naturalness response while maintaining
general utility, achieving forget--retain Pareto optimality. Remarkably, we
further observe that RULE improves the naturalness of model outputs, enhances
training efficiency, and exhibits strong generalization ability, generalizing
refusal behavior to semantically related but unseen queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型在现实应用中需确保事实一致性和可靠性，但迎合用户输入的行为损害了其可信度，目前缺乏针对视频语言领域的系统评估。

Method: 提出VISE基准，涵盖多样化问题格式、提示偏见和视觉推理任务，结合语言学视角分析迎合行为，并探索关键帧选择作为缓解方法。

Result: VISE首次系统评估视频大语言模型的迎合行为，关键帧选择显示出通过增强视觉基础减少迎合偏见的潜力。

Conclusion: VISE填补了视频语言领域迎合行为评估的空白，关键帧选择为未来研究提供了可行的缓解方向。

Abstract: As video large language models (Video-LLMs) become increasingly integrated
into real-world applications that demand grounded multimodal reasoning,
ensuring their factual consistency and reliability is of critical importance.
However, sycophancy, the tendency of these models to align with user input even
when it contradicts the visual evidence, undermines their trustworthiness in
such contexts. Current sycophancy research has largely overlooked its specific
manifestations in the video-language domain, resulting in a notable absence of
systematic benchmarks and targeted evaluations to understand how Video-LLMs
respond under misleading user input. To fill this gap, we propose VISE
(Video-LLM Sycophancy Benchmarking and Evaluation), the first dedicated
benchmark designed to evaluate sycophantic behavior in state-of-the-art
Video-LLMs across diverse question formats, prompt biases, and visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, VISE pioneeringly brings linguistic perspectives on
sycophancy into the visual domain, enabling fine-grained analysis across
multiple sycophancy types and interaction patterns. In addition, we explore
key-frame selection as an interpretable, training-free mitigation strategy,
which reveals potential paths for reducing sycophantic bias by strengthening
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDE-SQL框架通过动态SQL探针让大型语言模型在推理时自主探索数据库，显著提升Text-to-SQL任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态数据库信息，限制了模型对数据的动态理解能力。

Method: 提出SDE-SQL框架，生成并执行SQL探针，动态检索数据库信息以迭代更新模型理解。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，SDE-SQL比基线模型提升8.02%执行准确率，无需监督微调或模型集成。

Conclusion: SDE-SQL通过动态探索数据库显著提升性能，且监督微调可进一步优化结果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches
typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at
inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the
database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed,
human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To
address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large
language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during
inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which
allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and
iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL
operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as
in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in
execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing
a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the
performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52%
improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TF-IDF的句子排序方法，用于长文档分类，显著减少输入大小和推理延迟，同时保持分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长文档分类中，BERT等模型受限于固定输入长度和二次注意力复杂度，且全文档分类存在冗余。

Method: 采用TF-IDF句子排名方法，结合固定数量或百分比选择句子，并优化评分策略（归一化TF-IDF分数和句子长度）。

Result: 在MahaNews LDC数据集上，该方法优于基线方法，输入大小减少50%以上，推理延迟降低43%，分类准确率仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明在不牺牲性能的情况下，显著减少上下文是可行的，适用于实际长文档分类任务。

Abstract: Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational
limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are
constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity.
Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as
only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To
address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves
efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores
fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced
scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length.
Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method
consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence
selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy
with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while
reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent.
This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without
sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long
document classification tasks.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在处理粘着语（如菲律宾语）时的偏见来源，填补现有研究在非英语语言上的空白。

Method: 通过信息论偏见评分指标，分析了菲律宾语模型和三种多语言模型的偏见贡献。

Result: 菲律宾语模型的偏见更多由人物、物体和关系相关的词汇驱动，与英语模型的行为主题（如犯罪、性行为）形成对比。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了英语与非英语模型在处理社会人口群体和偏见输入时的差异。

Abstract: Emerging research on bias attribution and interpretability have revealed how
tokens contribute to biased behavior in language models processing English
texts. We build on this line of inquiry by adapting the information-theoretic
bias attribution score metric for implementation on models handling
agglutinative languages, particularly Filipino. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our adapted method by using it on a purely Filipino model and
on three multilingual models: one trained on languages worldwide and two on
Southeast Asian data. Our results show that Filipino models are driven towards
bias by words pertaining to people, objects, and relationships, entity-based
themes that stand in contrast to the action-heavy nature of bias-contributing
themes in English (i.e., criminal, sexual, and prosocial behaviors). These
findings point to differences in how English and non-English models process
inputs linked to sociodemographic groups and bias.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理随时间演变的文本数据时的局限性，并提出了一个轻量级框架来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于预训练数据，且更新成本高，无法适应实时信息变化。

Method: 引入两个新基准（Temporal Wiki和Unified Clark），并提出一个轻量级外部记忆框架。

Result: 该方法在复杂推理和冲突事实整合上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了LLMs在动态知识更新中的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in question
answering and reasoning thanks to their extensive parametric memory. However,
their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,
while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge
typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning
(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of
modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs
perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect
evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a
player's "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new
benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical
Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news
articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be
misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these
issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a
structured, external memory from source documents without requiring
re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve
and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time.
Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both
benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or
integration of conflicting facts.

Motivation: 代码切换在低资源语言环境中对句法分析构成挑战，现有解析器难以处理多语言混合输入。

Method: 开发了基于提示的框架，结合少量样本LLM提示和专家评审，并发布了两个标注数据集。

Result: BiLingua Parser在专家修订后达到95.29% LAS，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LLM在精心指导下可作为低资源代码切换环境中句法资源构建的实用工具。

Abstract: Code-switching presents a complex challenge for syntactic analysis,
especially in low-resource language settings where annotated data is scarce.
While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for
sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well
these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover,
existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to
multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the
BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal
Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a
prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data,
combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two
annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus.
Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across
language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that
BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly
outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that
LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping
syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments. Data and
source code are available at https://github.com/N3mika/ParsingProject

Method: 系统评估了温度（0-2）对六种能力的影响，分析了三种规模的开源模型，并提出了BERT温度选择器。

Result: 温度对模型性能有技能特异性影响，BERT选择器显著提升中小模型在SuperGLUE的表现，温度效应在FP16和4位量化模型中一致。

Conclusion: 温度选择复杂且模型大小相关，BERT选择器为实用解决方案，温度效应在量化模型中保持一致。

Abstract: The sampling temperature, a critical hyperparameter in large language models
(LLMs), modifies the logits before the softmax layer, thereby reshaping the
distribution of output tokens. Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic
Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding
semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by
sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study,
we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on
data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical
analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium
(6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific
effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of
optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of
these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt.
We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of
small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study
extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are
consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating
temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the
Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes
occur -- increases with model size.

Method: 在GUM语料库测试集上进行标注试点，提出新的桥接子类型分类系统，并与现有方案对比。

Result: 发现现有资源可能严重标注不足，桥接子类型标注一致性中等，但桥接实例识别一致性较低。

Conclusion: 桥接标注中的主观性显著，需要更清晰的标注标准和分类系统。

Abstract: Bridging refers to the associative relationship between inferable entities in
a discourse and the antecedents which allow us to understand them, such as
understanding what "the door" means with respect to an aforementioned "house".
As identifying associative relations between entities is an inherently
subjective task, it is difficult to achieve consistent agreement in the
annotation of bridging anaphora and their antecedents. In this paper, we
explore the subjectivity involved in the annotation of bridging instances at
three levels: anaphor recognition, antecedent resolution, and bridging subtype
selection. To do this, we conduct an annotation pilot on the test set of the
existing GUM corpus, and propose a newly developed classification system for
bridging subtypes, which we compare to previously proposed schemes. Our results
suggest that some previous resources are likely to be severely under-annotated.
We also find that while agreement on the bridging subtype category was
moderate, annotator overlap for exhaustively identifying instances of bridging
is low, and that many disagreements resulted from subjective understanding of
the entities involved.

Result: 幻觉率降至5%以下，准确率提升至95%以上，外部检索减少30%。

Conclusion: ConfQA和Dual Neural Knowledge框架有效减少幻觉并提升LLM的事实性回答能力。

Abstract: Can we teach Large Language Models (LLMs) to refrain from hallucinating
factual statements? In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we
call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across
multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a
question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is
trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the
training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only
if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which
hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual
statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs
calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and
question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge
framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural
knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA's
confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while
reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

Result: 发现模型间存在显著异质性、评分不对称性、对提示框架的敏感性以及对高频词的过度估值，并揭示了潜在的偏见问题。

Conclusion: 奖励模型的可互换性和作为复杂人类价值观代理的适用性受到挑战，需警惕其潜在偏见对下游模型的影响。

Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language
models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward
models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models
themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning
prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We
present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive
analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining
how different reward models score every possible single-token response to
value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial
heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic
asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant
sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv)
overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten
recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures.
Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward
models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and
context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning
biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended
consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating
through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.

Conclusion: SRPS能有效增强LLMs的推理能力，提供更好的可解释性和稳定性。

Abstract: Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing
Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal
model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts
latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant
features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that
can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity.
Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers
insights into how role information influences internal model activations.
Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes
demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves
from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to
45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning
ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to
traditional prompt-based role-playing.

Motivation: 现有Finetuning-as-a-Service可能导致LLM安全性下降，尤其是当用户数据包含有害提示时。目前缺乏从用户数据中过滤有害内容的根本解决方案。

Method: 利用安全对齐LLM的拒绝特征区分有害与无害提示，训练ReFT模型作为教师模型，在微调时过滤有害提示并传递对齐知识。

Result: 实验表明，ReFT方法能有效减少有害输出，同时提高用户特定任务的微调准确性。

Conclusion: ReFT为Finetuning-as-a-Service提供了一种安全可靠的解决方案，确保LLM在定制化任务中的安全性。

Abstract: Recently, major AI service providers such as Google and OpenAI have
introduced Finetuning-as-a-Service, which enables users to customize Large
Language Models (LLMs) for specific downstream tasks using their own data.
However, this service is vulnerable to degradation of LLM safety-alignment when
user data contains harmful prompts. While some prior works address this issue,
fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored.
Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting
refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs
can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the
Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify
harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its
refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that
filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into
the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based
finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances
finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for
secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.

Motivation: 现有文本到SQL研究依赖BIRD数据集，但该数据集假设用户具备专业知识和领域知识，且人工生成的证据存在缺陷，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SEED方法，通过系统分析数据库模式、描述文件和值来自动生成证据。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider数据集上评估，SEED显著提高了无证据场景下的SQL生成准确性，甚至在某些情况下优于提供BIRD证据的设置。

Conclusion: SEED生成的证据不仅缩小了研究与实际部署之间的差距，还提高了文本到SQL模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables non-experts to retrieve data from databases by converting
natural language queries into SQL. However, state-of-the-art text-to-SQL
studies rely on the BIRD dataset, which assumes that evidence is provided along
with questions. Although BIRD facilitates research advancements, it assumes
that users have expertise and domain knowledge, contradicting the fundamental
goal of text-to-SQL. In addition, human-generated evidence in BIRD contains
defects, including missing or erroneous evidence, which affects model
performance. To address this issue, we propose SEED (System for Evidence
Extraction and Domain knowledge generation), an approach that automatically
generates evidence to improve performance and practical usability in real-world
scenarios. SEED systematically analyzes database schema, description files, and
values to extract relevant information. We evaluated SEED on BIRD and Spider,
demonstrating that it significantly improves SQL generation accuracy in the
no-evidence scenario, and in some cases, even outperforms the setting where
BIRD evidence is provided. Our results highlight that SEED-generated evidence
not only bridges the gap between research and real-world deployment but also
improves the adaptability and robustness of text-to-SQL models. Our code is

Conclusion: PiFi成功结合了LLMs和SLMs的优势，实现了高效高性能的NLP解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their extensive linguistic
knowledge and strong generalization capabilities, but their high computational
demands make them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments. In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often
lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose
PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to
achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single
frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for
specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in
computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance
improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including
both natural language understanding and generation. Moreover, our findings
demonstrate PiFi's ability to effectively leverage LLM knowledge, enhancing
generalization to unseen domains and facilitating the transfer of linguistic

### [89] [Conjoined Predication and Scalar Implicature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07429)
*Ratna Kandala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Magri (2016)的研究探讨了连词引发的两个难题，其中一个未解之谜揭示了量化、集体/并发解释与语境更新维度之间的隐藏互动。本文通过理论框架分析，认为这种不协调源于连词谓语的集体或并发解读，并提出语用机制的作用超出了基于穷尽化的语法许可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Magri (2016)中未解的第一个难题，揭示量化、集体/并发解释与语境更新之间的隐藏互动。

Method: 通过理论框架分析，探讨连词谓语的集体或并发解读如何导致间接语境矛盾。

Result: 发现不协调源于集体或并发解读，并指出语用机制的作用超出传统语法许可解释。

Conclusion: 连词难题揭示了语用机制在解释语言现象中的重要性，扩展了现有理论的范围。

Abstract: Magri (2016) investigates two puzzles arising from conjunction. Although
Magri has proposed a solution to the second puzzle, the first remains
unresolved. This first puzzle reveals a hidden interaction among
quantification, collective/concurrent interpretation, and contextual updating
dimensions that have yet to be explored. In essence, the problem is that
certain forms of sentences like "Some Italians come from a warm country," when
conjoined as in "(Only) Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond,"
sound infelicitous, even though no obvious alternative triggers a conflicting
scalar implicature. In this paper, we offer a conceptual analysis of Magri's
first puzzle by situating it within its original theoretical framework. We
argue that the oddness arises from the collective or concurrent reading of the
conjunctive predicate: in examples such as "(Only) Some Italians come from a
warm country and are blond," this interpretation generates an indirect
contextual contradiction. Moreover, we suggest that the pragmatic mechanisms
governing scalar implicature generation extend beyond what is captured by
exhaustification-based grammatical licensing accounts.

*Feifan Song,Shaohang Wei,Wen Luo,Yuxuan Fan,Tianyu Liu,Guoyin Wang,Houfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为弱到强解码（WSD）的新框架，通过小模型引导大模型生成对齐内容，解决了低资源对齐方法的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为避免LLM生成不当内容，需对齐人类偏好，但低资源方法在获取高质量对齐内容时面临困难。

Method: 小模型首先生成对齐的开头，大模型继续后续内容，通过自动切换机制控制。

Result: WSD框架显著提升了基础模型的对齐能力，优于基线方法，且避免了对下游任务的负面影响。

Conclusion: WSD通过小模型引导大模型，有效解决了对齐问题，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require alignment with human preferences to
avoid generating offensive, false, or meaningless content. Recently,
low-resource methods for LLM alignment have been popular, while still facing
challenges in obtaining both high-quality and aligned content. Motivated by the
observation that the difficulty of generating aligned responses is concentrated
at the beginning of decoding, we propose a novel framework, Weak-to-Strong
Decoding (WSD), to enhance the alignment ability of base models by the guidance
of a small aligned model. The small model first drafts well-aligned beginnings,
followed by the large base model to continue the rest, controlled by a
well-designed auto-switch mechanism. We also collect a new dataset, GenerAlign,
to fine-tune a small-sized Pilot-3B as the draft model, which effectively
enhances different base models under the WSD framework to outperform all
baseline methods, while avoiding degradation on downstream tasks, termed as the
alignment tax. Extensive experiments are further conducted to examine the
impact of different settings and time efficiency, as well as analyses on the
intrinsic mechanisms of WSD in depth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于指令的统一框架，用于学习适用于信息检索（IR）和非IR任务的通用文本嵌入，结合上下文学习、软监督和自适应硬负样本挖掘，无需任务特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文本嵌入模型在通用性和任务适应性上的局限性，通过统一框架提升嵌入的泛化能力和性能。

Method: 基于Mistral-7B模型，结合结构化指令、少样本示例、软标签框架和自适应硬负样本挖掘技术。

Result: 在MTEB（v2）基准测试中表现优异，涵盖41项任务，优于多个更大或完全微调的基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合上下文提示、软监督和自适应采样，能够高效生成高质量且可扩展的文本嵌入。

Abstract: This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning
generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and
non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our
approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive
hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific
fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide
the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification,
semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic
discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance
scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve
as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive
margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous
negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing
training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the
newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven
categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and
ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several
larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive
sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DALTA的新框架，用于低资源主题建模，通过域适应方法提升主题一致性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，导致主题推断不稳定且不连贯。

Method: DALTA框架采用共享编码器提取域不变特征，专用解码器处理域特定细节，并通过对抗对齐选择性转移信息。

Result: 实验表明，DALTA在主题一致性、稳定性和可转移性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DALTA为低资源主题建模提供了一种有效的域适应解决方案。

Abstract: Topic modeling plays a vital role in uncovering hidden semantic structures
within text corpora, but existing models struggle in low-resource settings
where limited target-domain data leads to unstable and incoherent topic
inference. We address this challenge by formally introducing domain adaptation
for low-resource topic modeling, where a high-resource source domain informs a
low-resource target domain without overwhelming it with irrelevant content. We
establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge
transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space
discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights,
we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that
employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders
for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer
relevant information. Experiments on diverse low-resource datasets demonstrate
that DALTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic
coherence, stability, and transferability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KScope的分层框架，用于系统评估大型语言模型（LLM）的知识状态，并将其分为五种类型。通过实验验证了上下文支持、特征分析和可信度增强对知识更新的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在知识冲突下的行为，但未能全面评估其对问题的知识掌握程度。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入五种知识状态的分类法，并提出KScope框架，通过统计测试逐步细化假设并分类知识状态。实验覆盖九个LLM和四个数据集。

Result: 研究发现上下文支持缩小知识差距，特定上下文特征驱动成功更新，LLM在不同知识状态下表现各异，特征分析和可信度增强提升更新效果。

Conclusion: KScope框架有效分类LLM知识状态，上下文特征分析和可信度增强可优化知识更新，适用于多种LLM。

Abstract: Characterizing a large language model's (LLM's) knowledge of a given question
is challenging. As a result, prior work has primarily examined LLM behavior
under knowledge conflicts, where the model's internal parametric memory
contradicts information in the external context. However, this does not fully
reflect how well the model knows the answer to the question. In this paper, we
first introduce a taxonomy of five knowledge statuses based on the consistency
and correctness of LLM knowledge modes. We then propose KScope, a hierarchical
framework of statistical tests that progressively refines hypotheses about
knowledge modes and characterizes LLM knowledge into one of these five
statuses. We apply KScope to nine LLMs across four datasets and systematically
establish: (1) Supporting context narrows knowledge gaps across models. (2)
Context features related to difficulty, relevance, and familiarity drive
successful knowledge updates. (3) LLMs exhibit similar feature preferences when
partially correct or conflicted, but diverge sharply when consistently wrong.
(4) Context summarization constrained by our feature analysis, together with
enhanced credibility, further improves update effectiveness and generalizes
across LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM的可靠性，优化人类与LLM协作中的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 分析了40种LLM UQ方法，识别出三个主要问题，并提出改进方向。

Result: 发现当前UQ方法在生态效度、不确定性类型和评价指标上存在问题。

Conclusion: 建议采用更以用户为中心的方法改进LLM不确定性量化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly assisting users in the real
world, yet their reliability remains a concern. Uncertainty quantification (UQ)
has been heralded as a tool to enhance human-LLM collaboration by enabling
users to know when to trust LLM predictions. We argue that current practices
for uncertainty quantification in LLMs are not optimal for developing useful UQ
for human users making decisions in real-world tasks. Through an analysis of 40
LLM UQ methods, we identify three prevalent practices hindering the community's
progress toward its goal of benefiting downstream users: 1) evaluating on
benchmarks with low ecological validity; 2) considering only epistemic
uncertainty; and 3) optimizing metrics that are not necessarily indicative of
downstream utility. For each issue, we propose concrete user-centric practices
and research directions that LLM UQ researchers should consider. Instead of
hill-climbing on unrepresentative tasks using imperfect metrics, we argue that
the community should adopt a more human-centered approach to LLM uncertainty
quantification.

TL;DR: CCI4.0是一个大规模双语预训练数据集，包含CCI4.0-M2-Base和CCI4.0-M2-CoT两个子集，通过高质量数据处理和多样化推理轨迹提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据质量动态变化和多样化推理轨迹的需求，提升LLM在下游任务中的表现。

Method: 提出两阶段去重、多分类器质量评分和领域感知流畅性过滤的数据处理流程，并提取45亿条CoT模板。

Result: 实验表明，CCI4.0预训练的LLM在数学和代码任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 严格的数据处理和人类推理模板对LLM性能提升至关重要，为自动处理预训练语料提供了启示。

Abstract: We introduce CCI4.0, a large-scale bilingual pre-training dataset engineered
for superior data quality and diverse human-like reasoning trajectory. CCI4.0
occupies roughly $35$ TB of disk space and comprises two sub-datasets:
CCI4.0-M2-Base and CCI4.0-M2-CoT. CCI4.0-M2-Base combines a $5.2$ TB carefully
curated Chinese web corpus, a $22.5$ TB English subset from Nemotron-CC, and
diverse sources from math, wiki, arxiv, and code. Although these data are
mostly sourced from well-processed datasets, the quality standards of various
domains are dynamic and require extensive expert experience and labor to
process. So, we propose a novel pipeline justifying data quality mainly based
on models through two-stage deduplication, multiclassifier quality scoring, and
domain-aware fluency filtering. We extract $4.5$ billion pieces of
CoT(Chain-of-Thought) templates, named CCI4.0-M2-CoT. Differing from the
distillation of CoT from larger models, our proposed staged CoT extraction
exemplifies diverse reasoning patterns and significantly decreases the
possibility of hallucination. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LLMs
pre-trained in CCI4.0 benefit from cleaner, more reliable training signals,
yielding consistent improvements in downstream tasks, especially in math and
code reflection tasks. Our results underscore the critical role of rigorous
data curation and human thinking templates in advancing LLM performance,
shedding some light on automatically processing pretraining corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档摘要中的公平性对决策至关重要，现有方法主要关注摘要级公平性，缺乏对语料库级公平性的研究。

Method: 提出FairPO方法，通过扰动文档集生成偏好对以提升摘要级公平性，并通过动态调整偏好对权重提升语料库级公平性。

Result: 实验表明，FairPO在保持摘要质量的同时优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FairPO在多文档摘要中实现了摘要级和语料库级的公平性，为公平性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) is crucial for providing
comprehensive views across documents with diverse social attribute values,
which can significantly impact decision-making. For example, a summarization
system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead
customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in
MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness
focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of
summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose
FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and
corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to
generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level
fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting
the weights of preference pairs. Our experiments show that FairPO outperforms
strong baselines while maintaining the critical qualities of summaries. The
code is available at https://github.com/leehaoyuan/coverage_fairnes.

TL;DR: GA LLM结合遗传算法与大型语言模型，通过进化操作优化结构化生成任务，比单独使用语言模型效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在严格约束下生成结构化内容（如计划或报告）的挑战，结合两种方法的优势。

Method: 将输出视为基因，语言模型指导进化操作（选择、交叉、变异），遗传算法确保结构完整性和全局优化。

Result: 在行程规划、学术大纲和商业报告等任务中表现优异，生成结果结构良好且满足需求。

Conclusion: GA LLM通过结合语言模型的创造力和遗传算法的优化能力，显著提升了约束满足和生成质量。

Abstract: GA LLM is a hybrid framework that combines Genetic Algorithms with Large
Language Models to handle structured generation tasks under strict constraints.
Each output, such as a plan or report, is treated as a gene, and evolutionary
operations like selection, crossover, and mutation are guided by the language
model to iteratively improve solutions. The language model provides domain
knowledge and creative variation, while the genetic algorithm ensures
structural integrity and global optimization. GA LLM has proven effective in
tasks such as itinerary planning, academic outlining, and business reporting,
consistently producing well structured and requirement satisfying results. Its
modular design also makes it easy to adapt to new tasks. Compared to using a
language model alone, GA LLM achieves better constraint satisfaction and higher
quality solutions by combining the strengths of both components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音消歧（DTS）研究不足，主要缺乏高质量数据集。DEBATE旨在通过语音线索（如发音、停顿、重音和语调）揭示说话者的真实意图。

Method: 构建DEBATE数据集，包含1,001个歧义语句，每个语句由10位母语者录制，涵盖多种语言歧义。详细描述数据收集流程并进行质量分析。

Result: 通过基准测试，发现当前大型语音和音频-语言模型在理解口语意图方面与人类存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DEBATE是首个此类数据集，为跨语言和文化的语音消歧研究奠定了基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on textual and visual disambiguation,
disambiguation through speech (DTS) remains underexplored. This is largely due
to the lack of high-quality datasets that pair spoken sentences with richly
ambiguous text. To address this gap, we present DEBATE, a unique public Chinese
speech-text dataset designed to study how speech cues and
patterns-pronunciation, pause, stress and intonation-can help resolve textual
ambiguity and reveal a speaker's true intent. DEBATE contains 1,001 carefully
selected ambiguous utterances, each recorded by 10 native speakers, capturing
diverse linguistic ambiguities and their disambiguation through speech. We
detail the data collection pipeline and provide rigorous quality analysis.
Additionally, we benchmark three state-of-the-art large speech and
audio-language models, illustrating clear and huge performance gaps between
machine and human understanding of spoken intent. DEBATE represents the first
effort of its kind and offers a foundation for building similar DTS datasets
across languages and cultures. The dataset and associated code are available

Result: 机器翻译和信息检索是首要需求，但需解决隐私、偏见和透明性问题。

Conclusion: 需透明沟通并解决隐私问题，以支持语言技术的广泛应用。

Abstract: There is an emerging effort to develop NLP for Indonesias 700+ local
languages, but progress remains costly due to the need for direct engagement
with native speakers. However, it is unclear what these language communities
truly need from language technology. To address this, we conduct a nationwide
survey to assess the actual needs of native speakers in Indonesia. Our findings
indicate that addressing language barriers, particularly through machine
translation and information retrieval, is the most critical priority. Although
there is strong enthusiasm for advancements in language technology, concerns
around privacy, bias, and the use of public data for AI training highlight the
need for greater transparency and clear communication to support broader AI

Conclusion: DeRAGEC在ASR系统中有效改进了NE校正，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: We present DeRAGEC, a method for improving Named Entity (NE) correction in
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By extending the
Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction (RAGEC) framework, DeRAGEC
employs synthetic denoising rationales to filter out noisy NE candidates before
correction. By leveraging phonetic similarity and augmented definitions, it
refines noisy retrieved NEs using in-context learning, requiring no additional
training. Experimental results on CommonVoice and STOP datasets show
significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) and NE hit ratio,
outperforming baseline ASR and RAGEC methods. Specifically, we achieved a 28%
relative reduction in WER compared to ASR without postprocessing. Our source

Motivation: 现有LLM生成的事后解释常与真实决策过程不一致，缺乏系统性解决方案，且评估成本高。

Method: 引入PSCB基准，分析解释自一致性，提出新指标，并通过Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)微调LLM。

Result: 自一致性评分在正确与错误预测间差异小，新指标更有效，DPO显著提升解释与决策特征的匹配度。

Conclusion: PSCB和DPO为提升LLM解释的可信度和自一致性提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability:
just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc
explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by
mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this
inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high
cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small
datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank
(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and
models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature
importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely
differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the
standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more
effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune
LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better
alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under
domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy,
self-consistent LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字节级回退虽能有效防止OOV，但在处理CJK语言和表情符号等字符多样性场景时，会导致序列长度显著增加，影响计算效率。

Method: 提出了一种简单的无损压缩技术。

Result: 该方法能够减少序列长度，同时保持信息完整性。

Conclusion: 该技术为处理字符多样性场景提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Byte-level fallbacks for subword tokenization have become a common practice
in large language models. In particular, it has been demonstrated to be
incredibly effective as a pragmatic solution for preventing OOV, especially in
the context of larger models. However, breaking a character down to individual
bytes significantly increases the sequence length for long-tail tokens in
languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) and other
character-diverse contexts such as emoji. The increased sequence length results
in longer computation during both training and inference. In this work, we
propose a simple compression technique that reduces the sequence length
losslessly.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，需要一种无需外部奖励模型的方法来提升其推理能力。

Method: SELT利用改进的MCTS，通过重新定义置信上限评分和分解推理过程为原子子任务，结合语义聚类，平衡探索与利用，减少冗余路径和幻觉。

Result: 在MMLU和Seal-Tools等基准测试中，SELT显著提高了答案准确性和推理鲁棒性，且无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: SELT展示了在多样化推理任务中的强泛化能力，为LLM推理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning
tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a
novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining
the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation
capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks
augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances
exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates
hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including
the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT
achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without
task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse
reasoning tasks. Relevant results and code are available at

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the large language models (LLMs), their application

settings. This work presents a literature review of context-aware translation
with LLMs. The existing works utilise prompting and fine-tuning approaches,
with few focusing on automatic post-editing and creating translation agents for
context-aware machine translation. We observed that the commercial LLMs (such
as ChatGPT and Tower LLM) achieved better results than the open-source LLMs
(such as Llama and Bloom LLMs), and prompt-based approaches serve as good
baselines to assess the quality of translations. Finally, we present some
interesting future directions to explore.

Abstract: Instructing language models with user intent requires large instruction
datasets, which are only available for a limited set of languages. In this
paper, we explore alternatives to conventional instruction adaptation pipelines
in low-resource scenarios. We assume a realistic scenario for low-resource
languages, where only the following are available: corpora in the target
language, existing open-weight multilingual base and instructed backbone LLMs,
and synthetically generated instructions sampled from the instructed backbone.
We present a comprehensive set of experiments for Basque that systematically
study different combinations of these components evaluated on benchmarks and
human preferences from 1,680 participants. Our conclusions show that target
language corpora are essential, with synthetic instructions yielding robust
models, and, most importantly, that using as backbone an instruction-tuned
model outperforms using a base non-instructed model, and improved results when
scaling up. Using Llama 3.1 instruct 70B as backbone our model comes near
frontier models of much larger sizes for Basque, without using any Basque data
apart from the 1.2B word corpora. We release code, models, instruction
datasets, and human preferences to support full reproducibility in future
research on low-resource language adaptation.

*Peyman Rostami,Vahid Rahimzadeh,Ali Adibi,Azadeh Shakery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对2024年美国总统选举的立场检测数据集PolitiSky24，收集自Bluesky平台，专注于Kamala Harris和Donald Trump，包含16,044个用户-目标立场对，并提供了丰富的元数据和标注方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注推文级别的立场，而用户级别的立场资源稀缺，尤其是在新兴平台如Bluesky上。用户级别的立场检测能更全面地反映用户的观点。

Method: 采用结合高级信息检索和大语言模型的标注流程，生成带有支持理由和文本片段的立场标签，标注准确率达到81%。

Result: 数据集PolitiSky24填补了政治立场分析的空白，具有时效性、开放性和用户级视角的特点。

Conclusion: 该数据集为政治立场分析提供了新的资源，支持更全面的用户立场研究。

Abstract: Stance detection identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a specific
target, such as a political figure. While previous datasets have focused
primarily on tweet-level stances from established platforms, user-level stance
resources, especially on emerging platforms like Bluesky remain scarce.
User-level stance detection provides a more holistic view by considering a
user's complete posting history rather than isolated posts. We present the
first stance detection dataset for the 2024 U.S. presidential election,
collected from Bluesky and centered on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The
dataset comprises 16,044 user-target stance pairs enriched with engagement
metadata, interaction graphs, and user posting histories. PolitiSky24 was
created using a carefully evaluated pipeline combining advanced information
retrieval and large language models, which generates stance labels with
supporting rationales and text spans for transparency. The labeling approach
achieves 81\% accuracy with scalable LLMs. This resource addresses gaps in
political stance analysis through its timeliness, open-data nature, and
user-level perspective. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次尝试将大语言模型（LLM）适配到乌克兰方言（Hutsul），通过构建平行语料库和词典，并利用RAG生成合成数据，最终微调模型在翻译任务中表现优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决乌克兰Hutsul方言这一低资源且形态复杂的方言的翻译问题，填补研究空白。

Method: 构建平行语料库和词典，提出RAG管道生成合成数据，微调开源LLM（使用LoRA），并采用多指标评估策略。

Result: 微调的小型模型（7B）在自动和LLM评估指标上均优于零样本基线（如GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: 通过数据增强和微调，小模型在低资源方言翻译任务中表现出色，为类似研究提供了参考。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce the first effort to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to the Ukrainian dialect (in our case Hutsul), a low-resource and
morphologically complex dialect spoken in the Carpathian Highlands. We created
a parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a
dictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by
proposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate
synthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.
We have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a
standard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o
translation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric
evaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment
(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform
zero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated
metrics. All data, models, and code are publicly released at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoRMA的新方法，通过将低秩适应从加法更新转向矩阵乘法变换，解决了计算复杂性和秩瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在NLP领域表现出色，但完全微调计算成本高。现有方法如LoRA虽高效，但采用加法更新，限制了其潜力。

Method: 提出LoRMA方法，通过矩阵乘法变换替代加法更新，优化操作顺序并引入秩膨胀策略。

Result: 实验证明LoRMA在多种评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRMA为低秩适应提供了更丰富的变换空间，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown remarkable capabilities in the NLP domain.
Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an
array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a
computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been
developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates.
In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which
shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix
multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational
complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively
re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms
of various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 通过细粒度标注教师意图提升LLM在教育场景中的教学响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏与教学策略的对齐，需任务特定适应以提升教育应用效果。

Method: 使用11种教学意图的细粒度分类重新标注MathDial数据集，并微调LLM。

Result: 细粒度模型生成的教学响应更符合教学策略且更有效。

Conclusion: 意图特异性对教育场景中的文本生成至关重要，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for educational applications,
particularly in intelligent tutoring systems. However, effective tutoring
requires alignment with pedagogical strategies - something current LLMs lack
without task-specific adaptation. In this work, we explore whether fine-grained
annotation of teacher intents can improve the quality of LLM-generated tutoring
responses. We focus on MathDial, a dialog dataset for math instruction, and
apply an automated annotation framework to re-annotate a portion of the dataset
using a detailed taxonomy of eleven pedagogical intents. We then fine-tune an
LLM using these new annotations and compare its performance to models trained
on the original four-category taxonomy. Both automatic and qualitative
evaluations show that the fine-grained model produces more pedagogically
aligned and effective responses. Our findings highlight the value of intent
specificity for controlled text generation in educational settings, and we
release our annotated data and code to facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了DOCCI-Critique基准和VNLI-Critique模型，用于评估和改进大视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成段落长度图像描述的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法难以捕捉细粒度错误，缺乏验证数据集，因此需要更精细的评估工具。

Method: 构建DOCCI-Critique基准，包含1,400条VLM生成的段落描述和10,216条人工标注；开发VNLI-Critique模型进行自动化事实分类和错误分析。

Result: VNLI-Critique在多个基准测试中表现优异；AutoRater与人类评估高度一致；Critic-and-Revise流程显著提升描述准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为VLM的细粒度评估提供了关键工具，显著提升了图像理解的准确性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate highly detailed,
paragraphlength image captions, yet evaluating their factual accuracy remains
challenging. Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for
shorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce
DOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100
images, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of
factual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph
context. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated
sentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight
three key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,
validated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and
strong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven
AutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent
alignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An
innovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide
LLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality
(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark
alongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for
fine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在辅助同行评审时，难以同时实现高效和深入的评审。TreeReview旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TreeReview通过递归分解高层次问题为细粒度子问题，构建问题树，并通过从叶到根的答案聚合生成最终评审。动态问题扩展机制用于生成后续问题以深入探究。

Result: 实验表明，TreeReview在全面性、深度和专家一致性上优于基线方法，同时减少了80%的LLM令牌使用量。

Conclusion: TreeReview为高效且深入的论文评审提供了一种有效解决方案，其代码和基准数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in
assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and
insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and
bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of
review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into
fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively
aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we
incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by
generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived
from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation
and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both
LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong
baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review
feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to
computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are
available at https://github.com/YuanChang98/tree-review.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在低资源语言（如波兰语）中容易受到字符和词级攻击，导致预测结果大幅改变，暴露其安全机制的潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多语言任务中表现优异，但其安全训练数据主要集中于高资源语言（如英语），导致在低资源语言中易受攻击。

Method: 通过少量字符修改和小型代理模型计算词重要性，构建低成本攻击方法。

Result: 攻击显著改变了LLM的预测结果，验证了其在低资源语言中的脆弱性，并可扩展至其他语言。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在低资源语言中的安全漏洞，并提供了数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their
susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional
evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data
contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them
vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show
how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few
characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We
find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the
predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be
used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack
construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential
vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be
extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for
further research.

Motivation: 构建高质量的日语TTS数据集需要准确的音素和韵律标注，传统方法依赖纯文本或音频，效果有限。

Result: 客观评估显示优于传统方法；主观评估表明标注自然度接近人工标注。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效生成高质量TTS数据集，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for annotating phonemic and prosodic
labels on a given audio-transcript pair, aimed at constructing Japanese
text-to-speech (TTS) datasets. Our approach involves fine-tuning a large-scale
pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, conditioned on ground
truth transcripts, to simultaneously output phrase-level graphemes and
annotation labels. To further correct errors in phonemic labeling, we employ a
decoding strategy that utilizes dictionary prior knowledge. The objective
evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous
approaches relying solely on text or audio. The subjective evaluation results
indicate that the naturalness of speech synthesized by the TTS model, trained
with labels annotated using our method, is comparable to that of a model
trained with manual annotations.

Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中的两个关键挑战：创建可靠的领域特定基准测试和理解领域适应过程中的知识表示。

Method: 使用TF和Term TF-IDF方法生成领域特定关键词和词表，构建提示-目标对，通过模型完成这些提示来评估领域知识。

Result: 实验表明，该基准测试与专家生成的基准测试高度相关，且比传统困惑度指标更准确地衡量领域知识。揭示了领域适应的快速性及知识表示的分层机制。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的领域特定语言模型评估方法，并为领域适应过程中的知识表示提供了新见解，有助于更高效的微调策略和减轻灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)
evaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding
knowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic
pipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks
without relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination
issues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach
generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term
TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by
measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct
domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with
low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple
models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we
demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated
benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than
traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens
rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to
domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.
By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that
initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while
later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during
adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction
happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical
evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into
knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more
efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成质量和问题复杂性方面存在问题，因此需要一种新方法来提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Method: 通过生成问题解决代码提取结构化信息，并利用结构化解决方案指导数据生成，应用于MATH和GSM8K数据集。

Result: 生成了39K个带标记中间步骤的问题和6.1K个高难度问题的基准测试，模型性能随推理长度增加而下降，微调实验验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法和数据集有望为未来提升LLM推理能力的研究做出贡献。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains challenging for LLMs due to complex logic and
the need for precise computation. Existing methods enhance LLM reasoning by
synthesizing datasets through problem rephrasing, but face issues with
generation quality and problem complexity. To address this, we propose to
extract structural information with generated problem-solving code from
mathematical reasoning and guide data generation with structured solutions.
Applied to MATH and GSM8K, our approach produces 39K problems with labeled
intermediate steps and a 6.1K-problem benchmark of higher difficulty. Results
on our benchmark show that model performance declines as reasoning length
increases. Additionally, we conducted fine-tuning experiments using the
proposed training data on a range of LLMs, and the results validate the
effectiveness of our dataset. We hope the proposed method and dataset will
contribute to future research in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估实时互动平台（如Twitch）的自动审核工具AutoMod在标记仇恨内容方面的有效性。

Method: 方法包括创建测试账户，通过Twitch API发送超过107,000条来自4个数据集的评论，测量AutoMod对明显仇恨内容的标记准确性。

Result: 结果显示，高达94%的仇恨内容未被标记，而添加侮辱性词汇后100%被删除；同时，89.5%的良性内容被误删。

Conclusion: 结论指出AutoMod存在重大缺陷，强调审核系统需提升对上下文的理解能力。

Abstract: To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to
automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement($\textit{e.g.}$, users
commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures
on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence,
relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this
paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool
($\texttt{AutoMod}$) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful
content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test
beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over
$107,000$ comments collated from $4$ datasets. We measure $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s
accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism,
ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful
messages, up to $94\%$ on some datasets, $\textit{bypass moderation}$.
Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in $100\%$ removal,
revealing $\texttt{AutoMod}$'s reliance on slurs as a moderation signal. We
also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, $\texttt{AutoMod}$
blocks up to $89.5\%$ of benign examples that use sensitive words in
pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in
$\texttt{AutoMod}$'s capabilities and underscores the importance for such
systems to understand context effectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估缺乏细粒度标注，难以衡量LLMs是否准确识别相关依据或适时回避回答。GaRAGe旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含多样化问题和标注段落的基准测试，评估LLMs在生成答案时对相关依据的识别能力及回避回答的表现。

Result: LLMs在严格依据相关段落（最高60%事实性得分）和适时回避回答（最高31%真阳性率）方面表现不佳，尤其在时效性问题和稀疏私有依据时更差。

Conclusion: GaRAGe揭示了当前LLMs在RAG任务中的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: We present GaRAGe, a large RAG benchmark with human-curated long-form answers
and annotations of each grounding passage, allowing a fine-grained evaluation
of whether LLMs can identify relevant grounding when generating RAG answers.
Our benchmark contains 2366 questions of diverse complexity, dynamism, and
topics, and includes over 35K annotated passages retrieved from both private
document sets and the Web, to reflect real-world RAG use cases. This makes it
an ideal test bed to evaluate an LLM's ability to identify only the relevant
information necessary to compose a response, or provide a deflective response
when there is insufficient information. Evaluations of multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise
rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant
passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b)
deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true
positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at
most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering
time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private
grounding sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE训练方法主要针对基础模型，应用于指令模型时重建质量和可解释性下降，需要针对性改进。

Method: FAST方法通过调整训练过程以匹配指令模型的数据分布和激活模式，优化SAEs的性能。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上，FAST的重建误差显著低于基线方法；在Llama3.2-3B-Instruct上，高质量特征比例显著提升。

Conclusion: FAST为指令模型提供了更优的SAE训练方法，并揭示了通过干预特殊令牌激活改进模型行为的新机会。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and capability, understanding
their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly critical. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) have emerged as a key tool in mechanistic interpretability, enabling the
extraction of human-interpretable features from LLMs. However, existing SAE
training methods are primarily designed for base models, resulting in reduced
reconstruction quality and interpretability when applied to instruct models. To
bridge this gap, we propose
$\underline{\textbf{F}}$inetuning-$\underline{\textbf{a}}$ligned
$\underline{\textbf{S}}$equential $\underline{\textbf{T}}$raining
($\textit{FAST}$), a novel training method specifically tailored for instruct
models. $\textit{FAST}$ aligns the training process with the data distribution
and activation patterns characteristic of instruct models, resulting in
substantial improvements in both reconstruction and feature interpretability.
On Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, $\textit{FAST}$ achieves a mean squared error of 0.6468
in token reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline methods with
errors of 5.1985 and 1.5096. In feature interpretability, $\textit{FAST}$
yields a higher proportion of high-quality features, for Llama3.2-3B-Instruct,
$21.1\%$ scored in the top range, compared to $7.0\%$ and $10.2\%$ for
$\textit{BT(P)}$ and $\textit{BT(F)}$. Surprisingly, we discover that
intervening on the activations of special tokens via the SAEs leads to
improvements in output quality, suggesting new opportunities for fine-grained
control of model behavior. Code, data, and 240 trained SAEs are available at
https://github.com/Geaming2002/FAST.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，小语言模型（SLMs）在长链思维（CoT）监督训练中会出现性能显著下降的现象，称为Long CoT Degradation。实验表明，这种现象普遍存在，且错误积累是主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小语言模型在长链思维训练中的性能表现，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 通过Qwen2.5、LLaMA3和Gemma3系列模型进行实验，分析长链思维训练对小模型的影响。

Result: 小模型在长链思维训练中性能显著下降，错误积累是主要原因；强化学习性能也可能受影响。

Conclusion: 长链思维训练对小模型的益处被高估，需谨慎使用；足够规模的监督微调可缓解问题。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to
enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we
identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language
models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience
significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the
Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is
widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT
examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.
Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even
training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original
performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error
accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step
reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we
find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement
learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about
the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for
building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种标准化的、模块化的多语言语法错误标注框架，解决了现有工具（如errant）在扩展到多样化语言时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法错误标注工具（如errant）在多语言支持上存在不足，需要一种更灵活且一致的方法。

Method: 结合语言无关的基础模块和语言特定的扩展，使用stanza重新实现errant以支持多语言覆盖。

Result: 框架成功应用于英语、德语、捷克语、韩语和中文，展示了其适应性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架支持跨语言的可扩展和可解释的语法错误标注，促进了多语言环境下更一致的评估。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) relies on accurate error annotation and
evaluation, yet existing frameworks, such as $\texttt{errant}$, face
limitations when extended to typologically diverse languages. In this paper, we
introduce a standardized, modular framework for multilingual grammatical error
annotation. Our approach combines a language-agnostic foundation with
structured language-specific extensions, enabling both consistency and
flexibility across languages. We reimplement $\texttt{errant}$ using
$\texttt{stanza}$ to support broader multilingual coverage, and demonstrate the
framework's adaptability through applications to English, German, Czech,
Korean, and Chinese, ranging from general-purpose annotation to more customized
linguistic refinements. This work supports scalable and interpretable GEC
annotation across languages and promotes more consistent evaluation in
multilingual settings. The complete codebase and annotation tools can be

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，将瑞士议会辩论的多小时音频转换为高质量语音-文本对，结合Whisper Large-v3和GPT-4o进行转录与修正，并通过数据驱动过滤提升质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为低资源、领域特定的语音语料库提供高质量的长格式数据集，改进现有句级语料库的局限性。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-v3转录音频为德语，再通过两步GPT-4o修正（命名实体修正和语义完整性评估），最后基于Predicted BLEU和GPT-4o评分过滤低质量片段。

Result: 最终语料库包含801小时音频，其中751小时通过质量控制，比原句级语料库BLEU得分提升6点。

Conclusion: 结合ASR、LLM修正和数据驱动过滤，显著提升了低资源领域语音语料库的质量。

Abstract: This paper presents a new long-form release of the Swiss Parliaments Corpus,
converting entire multi-hour Swiss German debate sessions (each aligned with
the official session protocols) into high-quality speech-text pairs. Our
pipeline starts by transcribing all session audio into Standard German using
Whisper Large-v3 under high-compute settings. We then apply a two-step GPT-4o
correction process: first, GPT-4o ingests the raw Whisper output alongside the
official protocols to refine misrecognitions, mainly named entities. Second, a
separate GPT-4o pass evaluates each refined segment for semantic completeness.
We filter out any segments whose Predicted BLEU score (derived from Whisper's
average token log-probability) and GPT-4o evaluation score fall below a certain
threshold. The final corpus contains 801 hours of audio, of which 751 hours
pass our quality control. Compared to the original sentence-level SPC release,
our long-form dataset achieves a 6-point BLEU improvement, demonstrating the
power of combining robust ASR, LLM-based correction, and data-driven filtering
for low-resource, domain-specific speech corpora.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习（RL）促进抽象推理的方法AbstraL，以应对大型语言模型（LLM）在分布变化时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型LLM在面对分布变化（如数值或名义变量变化、干扰性条款插入）时表现不稳定，现有方法通过生成合成数据来应对，但本文提出抽象化推理问题更有效。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）而非监督微调，训练模型从细粒度抽象数据中学习抽象推理能力，提出AbstraL方法。

Result: AbstraL显著减轻了在GSM扰动基准测试中的性能下降。

Conclusion: 抽象化推理结合强化学习能更有效地提升LLM的鲁棒性，优于传统合成数据方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially
smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to
experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as
changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting
clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data
to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In
contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not
only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection
to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process
is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised
fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method,
AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular
abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent
GSM perturbation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）遗忘技术的局限性，提出了形式依赖偏差问题，并引入ORT基准和ROCR方法以改进遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法在实际场景中效果有限，主要因为其性能依赖于训练样本形式，无法泛化到知识的不同表达方式。

Method: 论文提出ORT基准量化形式依赖偏差，并引入ROCR方法，通过重定向危险概念实现快速遗忘。

Result: 实验表明ROCR显著优于传统方法，能高效且自然地完成遗忘任务。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘应具备形式独立性，ROCR为解决这一问题提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to erase or suppress undesirable
knowledge within the model, offering promise for controlling harmful or private
information to prevent misuse. However, recent studies highlight its limited
efficacy in real-world scenarios, hindering practical adoption. In this study,
we identify a pervasive issue underlying many downstream failures: the
effectiveness of existing unlearning methods heavily depends on the form of
training samples and frequently fails to generalize to alternate expressions of
the same knowledge. We formally characterize this problem as Form-Dependent
Bias and systematically investigate its specific manifestation patterns across
various downstream tasks. To quantify its prevalence and support future
research, we introduce ORT, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of unlearning methods against variations in knowledge expression.
Results reveal that Form-Dependent Bias is both widespread and severe among
current techniques.
  We argue that LLM unlearning should be form-independent to address the
endless forms of downstream tasks encountered in real-world security-critical
scenarios. Towards this goal, we introduce Rank-one Concept Redirection (ROCR),
a novel training-free method, as a promising solution path. ROCR performs
unlearning by targeting the invariants in downstream tasks, specifically the
activated dangerous concepts. It is capable of modifying model parameters
within seconds to redirect the model's perception of a specific unlearning
target concept to another harmless concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that ROCR significantly improves unlearning effectiveness compared to
traditional methods while generating highly natural outputs.

Motivation: 解决半监督学习中伪标签选择和权重分配的问题，提升模型在数据不平衡情况下的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用三重重伪标签加权模块，结合头部一致性、自适应阈值和平均伪边际技术。

Result: 在5个NLP数据集的10个设置中，9个达到最优性能，并在高度不平衡数据中表现突出。

Conclusion: MultiMatch在性能和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，特别适用于数据不平衡的文本分类任务。

Abstract: We introduce MultiMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm
combining the paradigms of co-training and consistency regularization with
pseudo-labeling. At its core, MultiMatch features a three-fold pseudo-label
weighting module designed for three key purposes: selecting and filtering
pseudo-labels based on head agreement and model confidence, and weighting them
according to the perceived classification difficulty. This novel module
enhances and unifies three existing techniques -- heads agreement from
Multihead Co-training, self-adaptive thresholds from FreeMatch, and Average
Pseudo-Margins from MarginMatch -- resulting in a holistic approach that
improves robustness and performance in SSL settings. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of MultiMatch, achieving
state-of-the-art results on 9 out of 10 setups from 5 natural language
processing datasets and ranking first according to the Friedman test among 19
methods. Furthermore, MultiMatch demonstrates exceptional robustness in highly
imbalanced settings, outperforming the second-best approach by 3.26% -- and
data imbalance is a key factor for many text classification tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Generative AI technology, Multimodal Large
Language Models(MLLMs) have the potential to act as AI software engineers
capable of executing complex web application development. Considering that the
model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the
challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation
framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development
efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment
of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this
work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and
further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate
MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML
Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality
question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive
evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LeaF的两阶段框架，通过干预式推理消除训练数据中的虚假相关性，提升大语言模型在长上下文推理中的注意力分配能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中容易受到干扰模式的误导，导致推理准确性和生成质量下降，原因是训练数据中的虚假相关性阻碍了模型对真实因果关系的推断。

Method: LeaF框架分为两阶段：第一阶段通过梯度比较识别干扰性标记；第二阶段通过蒸馏修剪这些标记，使学生的注意力分布与教师的关键标记对齐。

Result: 实验表明，LeaF在数学推理和代码生成任务中显著提升性能，并有效抑制了对干扰标记的注意力，生成了更可靠和可解释的推理模型。

Conclusion: LeaF通过干预式推理解决了大语言模型在长上下文推理中的注意力分配问题，提升了模型的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in
contextual understanding. However, their ability to attend to truly critical
information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the
pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting
patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing
these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation
quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training
data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal
instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant
reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead
and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To
mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus
(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding
factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an
advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal
relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes
these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's
attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context
tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an
absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens
during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在实时更新知识时的高效性和可靠性问题，避免重新训练或遗忘已有信息。

Method: 使用残差记忆模块和样本依赖的稀疏掩码，将每个编辑限制在记忆参数的子集中，减少编辑间的干扰。推理时通过稀疏激活模式匹配相关编辑。

Result: 在问答、幻觉纠正和分布外泛化任务中表现优异，支持数千次连续编辑且遗忘最少。

Conclusion: MEMOIR在可靠性、泛化性和局部性方面达到最先进水平，适用于大规模知识更新。

Abstract: Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates
to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models
efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous
information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model
editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to
scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework
that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter
module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By
sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines
each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing
interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by
comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during
editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only
the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for
unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,
and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral
demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across
reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of
sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

Conclusion: MiniCPM4展示了高效性和广泛适用性，成功应用于多种场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)
designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through
systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training
data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of
model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention
mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context
processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and
accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,
a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable
satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training
tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient
pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by
introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and
data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose
CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative
sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse
on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B
parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4
outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks,
highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B
demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long

applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model

Motivation: 量子机器学习在复杂结构化数据建模中具有潜力，QGT旨在通过量子自注意力机制提升模型效率和表达能力。

Method: QGT将参数化量子电路（PQCs）嵌入图消息传递框架，实现量子自注意力机制，减少可训练参数。

Result: QGT在五个情感分类基准测试中表现优异，相比经典图变换器平均准确率提升5.42%（真实数据集）和4.76%（合成数据集），且样本效率提高50%。

Conclusion: QGT展示了图基量子自然语言处理技术在高效和可扩展语言理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a promising direction for building more efficient
and expressive models, particularly in domains where understanding complex,
structured data is critical. We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a
hybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention
mechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.
The attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while
significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical
attention mechanisms. We evaluate QGT on five sentiment classification
benchmarks. Experimental results show that QGT consistently achieves higher or
comparable accuracy than existing quantum natural language processing (QNLP)
models, including both attention-based and non-attention-based approaches. When
compared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average
accuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic
datasets. Additionally, QGT demonstrates improved sample efficiency, requiring
nearly 50% fewer labeled samples to reach comparable performance on the Yelp
dataset. These results highlight the potential of graph-based QNLP techniques
for advancing efficient and scalable language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法直接比较LLM输出或整个分布，且专注于不同问题（如偏见或公平性），因此需要一种新的框架来分析LLM的扰动影响。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛采样在低维语义相似空间中构建经验性的零分布和替代分布，将LLM扰动分析转化为频率假设检验问题。

Result: 框架具有模型无关性、支持任意输入扰动、提供可解释的p值、控制错误率及标量效应大小，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM审计提供了一种可靠的频率假设检验方法，能够量化响应变化并评估模型对齐性。

Abstract: Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model
(LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input
perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM
outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor
can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational
intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist,
they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or
fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a
framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist
hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output
distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte
Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional
assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation
of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields
interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled
error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can
quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate
alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable
frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.

Motivation: 当前语言模型对非规范令牌编码分配非零概率，导致概率质量浪费和错误分配，需改进。

Result: 实验表明，修正规范性问题提高了多个模型和语料库的似然性能。

Conclusion: 通过强制规范令牌编码，可有效提升语言模型的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Modern language models represent probability distributions over character
strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a
deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is
highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current
incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability
mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each
character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character
strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will
never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation
is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and
wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are
avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in
token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are
assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by
conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional
training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that
guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing
canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several
models and corpora.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs的多样性是否真正能减少模型的同质性，以及不同LLMs之间的差异是否显著。

Method: 通过对350多个LLMs进行大规模实证评估，使用两个流行排行榜和一个简历筛选任务，分析模型错误的相关性及其驱动因素。

Result: 发现模型错误高度相关（60%一致），尤其是更大、更准确的模型，即使架构和提供商不同。

Conclusion: LLMs的错误相关性显著，且在下游任务中产生实际影响，支持了算法单一化的理论预测。

Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to
mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether
different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical
evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a
resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on
one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We
identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and
providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly
correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we
show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge
evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions
regarding algorithmic monoculture.

Conclusion: RPT是一种有效且有前景的语言模型预训练扩展范式。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) as a new scaling
paradigm for large language models and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we reframe next-token prediction as a reasoning task trained
using RL, where it receives verifiable rewards for correctly predicting the
next token for a given context. RPT offers a scalable method to leverage vast
amounts of text data for general-purpose RL, rather than relying on
domain-specific annotated answers. By incentivizing the capability of
next-token reasoning, RPT significantly improves the language modeling accuracy
of predicting the next tokens. Moreover, RPT provides a strong pre-trained
foundation for further reinforcement fine-tuning. The scaling curves show that
increased training compute consistently improves the next-token prediction
accuracy. The results position RPT as an effective and promising scaling
paradigm to advance language model pre-training.

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems,
with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million
deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is
largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In
this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for
CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained
on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a
specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751
subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and
contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without
requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it
generates natural language risk reports and individualized health
recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow
supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于视觉变换器（ViTs）的医学图像对抗水印攻击的脆弱性，并通过对抗训练提高了模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ViTs在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其全局注意力机制使其易受对抗性扰动影响。本文旨在探索ViTs在医学图像中的脆弱性。

Method: 使用投影梯度下降（PGD）生成对抗水印，测试其对ViTs和CNNs的迁移性，并分析对抗训练的效果。

Result: ViTs对对抗攻击非常脆弱（准确率降至27.6%），但对抗训练可显著提升鲁棒性（准确率恢复至90.0%）。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学图像中易受对抗攻击，但对抗训练是有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown remarkable success in dermatological image
analysis, offering potential for automated skin disease diagnosis. Previously,
convolutional neural network(CNN) based architectures have achieved immense
popularity and success in computer vision (CV) based task like skin image
recognition, generation and video analysis. But with the emergence of
transformer based models, CV tasks are now are nowadays carrying out using
these models. Vision Transformers (ViTs) is such a transformer-based models
that have shown success in computer vision. It uses self-attention mechanisms
to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, their
reliance on global attention mechanisms makes them susceptible to adversarial
perturbations. This paper aims to investigate the susceptibility of ViTs for
medical images to adversarial watermarking-a method that adds so-called
imperceptible perturbations in order to fool models. By generating adversarial
watermarks through Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), we examine the
transferability of such attacks to CNNs and analyze the performance defense
mechanism -- adversarial training. Results indicate that while performance is
not compromised for clean images, ViTs certainly become much more vulnerable to
adversarial attacks: an accuracy drop of as low as 27.6%. Nevertheless,
adversarial training raises it up to 90.0%.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于RGB智能手机摄像头的远程健身追踪系统，提升隐私性、可扩展性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健身追踪模型要么运动种类有限，要么过于复杂难以部署，缺乏通用性。

Method: 开发多任务运动分析模型，利用大规模数据集Olympia（覆盖1900多种运动），结合视觉-语言模型实现运动检测和重复计数。

Result: 模型在Olympia数据集上，运动检测准确率76.5%，重复计数准确率85.3%。

Conclusion: 通过单一视觉-语言模型实现运动识别和计数，为AI健身追踪的普及迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce a fitness tracking system that enables remote monitoring for
exercises using only a RGB smartphone camera, making fitness tracking more
private, scalable, and cost effective. Although prior work explored automated
exercise supervision, existing models are either too limited in exercise
variety or too complex for real-world deployment. Prior approaches typically
focus on a small set of exercises and fail to generalize across diverse
movements. In contrast, we develop a robust, multitask motion analysis model
capable of performing exercise detection and repetition counting across
hundreds of exercises, a scale far beyond previous methods. We overcome
previous data limitations by assembling a large-scale fitness dataset, Olympia
covering more than 1,900 exercises. To our knowledge, our vision-language model
is the first that can perform multiple tasks on skeletal fitness data. On
Olympia, our model can detect exercises with 76.5% accuracy and count
repetitions with 85.3% off-by-one accuracy, using only RGB video. By presenting
a single vision-language transformer model for both exercise identification and
rep counting, we take a significant step toward democratizing AI-powered
fitness tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的基于高斯泼溅（GS）的语义SLAM算法，通过学习网络从RGB-D视频流增量构建3D场景表示，解决了现有GS方法依赖场景优化且泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM算法在相机跟踪方面表现优异，但生成的3D地图分辨率低且不完整。现有GS方法依赖场景优化，耗时长且泛化性差。

Method: 使用学习网络从RGB-D图像预测高斯参数，集成3D语义分割，并通过全局定位后仅优化1次高斯泼溅来纠正定位漂移和浮动物。

Result: 在ScanNet基准测试中表现最优，高斯数量比其他GS方法少一个数量级，并在NYUv2和TUM RGB-D数据集上展示了零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在语义SLAM中实现了高性能和高泛化能力，为3D映射和识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional SLAM algorithms are excellent at camera tracking but might
generate lower resolution and incomplete 3D maps. Recently, Gaussian Splatting
(GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map
building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene
optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes
well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM
algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from
an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach
starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian
parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location.
Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS
framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To
correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for
only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of
magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and
showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to
the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: 多模态模型整合能有效实现精细视听分割，无需特定标注。

Abstract: Audiovisual segmentation (AVS) aims to identify visual regions corresponding
to sound sources, playing a vital role in video understanding, surveillance,
and human-computer interaction. Traditional AVS methods depend on large-scale
pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. To
address this, we propose a novel zero-shot AVS framework that eliminates
task-specific training by leveraging multiple pretrained models. Our approach
integrates audio, vision, and text representations to bridge modality gaps,
enabling precise sound source segmentation without AVS-specific annotations. We
systematically explore different strategies for connecting pretrained models
and evaluate their efficacy across multiple datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot AVS
performance, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal model integration for
finegrained audiovisual segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DNNs在交通标志识别中广泛使用，但其训练数据可能来自未知来源，存在被攻击或污染的风险，因此需要确保模型的安全性。

Method: 通过向训练数据添加微小扰动进行误差最小化攻击，并提出一种基于非线性变换的数据增强训练方法以提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 攻击使DNNs的预测准确率从99.90%降至10.6%，而提出的方法成功恢复至96.05%，且优于对抗训练。检测模型识别攻击的成功率超过99%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在交通标志识别系统中采用先进训练方法以抵御数据污染攻击的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for traffic sign recognition
because they can automatically extract high-level features from images. These
DNNs are trained on large-scale datasets obtained from unknown sources.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the models remain secure and are not
compromised or poisoned during training. In this paper, we investigate the
robustness of DNNs trained for traffic sign recognition. First, we perform the
error-minimizing attacks on DNNs used for traffic sign recognition by adding
imperceptible perturbations on training data. Then, we propose a data
augmentation-based training method to mitigate the error-minimizing attacks.
The proposed training method utilizes nonlinear transformations to disrupt the
perturbations and improve the model robustness. We experiment with two
well-known traffic sign datasets to demonstrate the severity of the attack and
the effectiveness of our mitigation scheme. The error-minimizing attacks reduce
the prediction accuracy of the DNNs from 99.90% to 10.6%. However, our
mitigation scheme successfully restores the prediction accuracy to 96.05%.
Moreover, our approach outperforms adversarial training in mitigating the
error-minimizing attacks. Furthermore, we propose a detection model capable of
identifying poisoned data even when the perturbations are imperceptible to
human inspection. Our detection model achieves a success rate of over 99% in
identifying the attack. This research highlights the need to employ advanced
training methods for DNNs in traffic sign recognition systems to mitigate the
effects of data poisoning attacks.

Motivation: 纺织品回收中的自动化分拣对效率和可扩展性至关重要，但准确识别材料成分和检测污染物仍具挑战性。

Method: 研究采用RGB图像，利用迁移学习评估预训练架构（如EfficientNetB0）进行分类，并结合Grounding DINO和Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行零样本分割。

Result: 分类任务中EfficientNetB0达到81.25%准确率；分割任务中mIoU为0.90，表现优异。

Conclusion: RGB图像结合现代深度学习技术可有效支持自动化纺织品回收的关键分析步骤。

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of
textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and
detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper
investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing
modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present
computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a)
classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile
features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained
architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with
EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with
81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the
Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the
generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility
of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including
transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot
segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile
recycling pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监控系统因低质量图像和视频导致面部识别准确性下降，且AI模型存在肤色和遮挡相关的偏见，限制了其在实际场景中的有效性。这些问题源于数据不足和多样性缺失。

Method: 采用基于深度学习的面部属性操纵和重建技术（如自动编码器和生成对抗网络），生成多样化的高质量面部数据集，并集成图像增强模块提升低分辨率或遮挡面部的清晰度。

Result: 在CelebA数据集上的评估表明，该平台显著提升了训练数据的多样性和模型的公平性。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于减少AI面部分析的偏见，提升监控系统在复杂环境中的准确性和可靠性，推动更公平的安全应用。

Abstract: Surveillance systems play a critical role in security and reconnaissance, but
their performance is often compromised by low-quality images and videos,
leading to reduced accuracy in face recognition. Additionally, existing
AI-based facial analysis models suffer from biases related to skin tone
variations and partially occluded faces, further limiting their effectiveness
in diverse real-world scenarios. These challenges are the results of data
limitations and imbalances, where available training datasets lack sufficient
diversity, resulting in unfair and unreliable facial recognition performance.
To address these issues, we propose a data-driven platform that enhances
surveillance capabilities by generating synthetic training data tailored to
compensate for dataset biases. Our approach leverages deep learning-based
facial attribute manipulation and reconstruction using autoencoders and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create diverse and high-quality
facial datasets. Additionally, our system integrates an image enhancement
module, improving the clarity of low-resolution or occluded faces in
surveillance footage. We evaluate our approach using the CelebA dataset,
demonstrating that the proposed platform enhances both training data diversity
and model fairness. This work contributes to reducing bias in AI-based facial
analysis and improving surveillance accuracy in challenging environments,
leading to fairer and more reliable security applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高时间分辨率适合运动任务，但获取真实标注昂贵且困难，因此需要自监督方法。

Method: 提出EV-LayerSegNet，通过分层动态表示分别学习仿射光流和分割掩码，并利用去模糊质量作为自监督损失。

Result: 在仅含仿射运动的模拟数据集上，IoU和检测率分别达到71%和87%。

Conclusion: EV-LayerSegNet在自监督事件相机运动分割中表现良好，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics
with much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels
react asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited
for tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training
event-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining
ground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this
article, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based
motion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene
dynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and
segmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The
deblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.
We train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,
achieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RARL的强化学习框架，旨在提升医学视觉语言模型（VLM）的推理能力，同时保持高效性和低资源适应性。实验表明，RARL在医学图像分析和临床推理任务中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学VLM在泛化性、透明性和计算效率方面存在局限性，阻碍了其在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 采用低秩适应（Low-Rank Adaptation）和自定义奖励函数对轻量级基础模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct进行微调，结合诊断准确性和推理质量。训练在单个NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU上完成。

Conclusion: 推理引导学习和推理提示能显著提升医学VLM的透明性、准确性和资源效率，为临床决策提供支持。

Abstract: The growing integration of vision-language models (VLMs) in medical
applications offers promising support for diagnostic reasoning. However,
current medical VLMs often face limitations in generalization, transparency,
and computational efficiency-barriers that hinder deployment in real-world,
resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
Reasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \textbf{RARL}, that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and
adaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight
base model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward
functions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.
Training is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the
feasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate
the model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and
explanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves
VLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming
supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while
requiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the
generalization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving
around 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%
over traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity
prompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial
for enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of
reasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward
more transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.
Code and data are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本CIR在FashionIQ基准上的表现不佳（Recall@10仅20-25%），因此研究如何通过改进模型和方法提升性能。

Method: 1. 微调BLIP-2，使用轻量级Q-Former融合视觉和文本特征；2. 探索Retrieval-DPO方法，通过Direct Preference Optimization损失微调CLIP文本编码器。

Result: BLIP-2改进后Recall@10显著提升（45.6%衬衫，40.1%连衣裙，50.4%T恤），平均Recall@50达67.6%；Retrieval-DPO表现不佳（Recall@10仅0.02%）。

Conclusion: 有效的CIR需要多模态融合、排名感知目标和高质量负样本，Retrieval-DPO因缺乏这些要素而失败。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) allows a user to locate a target image by
applying a fine-grained textual edit (e.g., ``turn the dress blue'' or ``remove
stripes'') to a reference image. Zero-shot CIR, which embeds the image and the
text with separate pretrained vision-language encoders, reaches only 20-25\%
Recall@10 on the FashionIQ benchmark. We improve this by fine-tuning BLIP-2
with a lightweight Q-Former that fuses visual and textual features into a
single embedding, raising Recall@10 to 45.6\% (shirt), 40.1\% (dress), and
50.4\% (top-tee) and increasing the average Recall@50 to 67.6\%. We also
examine Retrieval-DPO, which fine-tunes CLIP's text encoder with a Direct
Preference Optimization loss applied to FAISS-mined hard negatives. Despite
extensive tuning of the scaling factor, index, and sampling strategy,
Retrieval-DPO attains only 0.02\% Recall@10 -- far below zero-shot and
prompt-tuned baselines -- because it (i) lacks joint image-text fusion, (ii)
uses a margin objective misaligned with top-$K$ metrics, (iii) relies on
low-quality negatives, and (iv) keeps the vision and Transformer layers frozen.
Our results show that effective preference-based CIR requires genuine
multimodal fusion, ranking-aware objectives, and carefully curated negatives.

Abstract: Visual parsing of images and videos is critical for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, progress in this field is constrained by
limitations of existing datasets: (1) insufficient annotation granularity,
which impedes fine-grained scene understanding and high-level reasoning; (2)
limited coverage of domains, particularly a lack of datasets tailored for
educational scenarios; and (3) lack of explicit procedural guidance, with
minimal logical rules and insufficient representation of structured task
process. To address these gaps, we introduce PhysLab, the first video dataset
that captures students conducting complex physics experiments. The dataset
includes four representative experiments that feature diverse scientific
instruments and rich human-object interaction (HOI) patterns. PhysLab comprises
620 long-form videos and provides multilevel annotations that support a variety
of vision tasks, including action recognition, object detection, HOI analysis,
etc. We establish strong baselines and perform extensive evaluations to
highlight key challenges in the parsing of procedural educational videos. We
expect PhysLab to serve as a valuable resource for advancing fine-grained
visual parsing, facilitating intelligent classroom systems, and fostering
closer integration between computer vision and educational technologies. The

Motivation: 现有深度估计方法通常依赖多张图像，而单张模糊图像的深度估计问题欠约束，因此提出利用暗通道和局部模糊与对比度变化的关系作为深度线索。

Method: 利用暗通道和局部模糊与对比度变化的关系作为深度线索，通过对抗训练实现端到端学习。

Result: 在真实数据上的实验表明，结合暗通道先验的单图像深度估计方法能够生成有意义的深度结果。

Conclusion: 暗通道先验的引入有效提升了单张模糊图像深度估计的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the dark channel as a complementary cue to estimate
the depth of a scene from a single space-variant defocus blurred image due to
its effectiveness in implicitly capturing the local statistics of blurred
images and the scene structure. Existing depth-from-defocus (DFD) techniques
typically rely on multiple images with varying apertures or focus settings to
recover depth information. Very few attempts have focused on DFD from a single
defocused image due to the underconstrained nature of the problem. Our method
capitalizes on the relationship between local defocus blur and contrast
variations as key depth cues to enhance the overall performance in estimating
the scene's structure. The entire pipeline is trained adversarially in a fully
end-to-end fashion. Experiments conducted on real data with realistic
depth-induced defocus blur demonstrate that incorporating dark channel prior
into single image DFD yields meaningful depth estimation results, validating
the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: PGHM为单目化身创建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Photorealistic and animatable human avatars are a key enabler for
virtual/augmented reality, telepresence, and digital entertainment. While
recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering
quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges,
including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under
sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human
Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human
priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from
monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent
identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance
into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that
predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and
view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust
rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing
efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long
optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient
than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes
per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby
demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar
creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在洪水灾害后建筑物损坏分类中表现不佳，主要因为洪水破坏的痕迹不明显。

Method: 结合SAR/InSAR、高分辨率光学图像和洪水风险层，采用多模态Mamba架构和半Siamese编码器进行联合预测。

Result: 在Hurricane Harvey数据上，F1分数比现有方法提升19个百分点，尤其在“轻微”和“中等”损坏类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: Flood-DamageSense通过风险感知建模和SAR全天候能力，提供了更快速、精细和可靠的洪水损坏评估，支持灾后决策。

Abstract: Most post-disaster damage classifiers succeed only when destructive forces
leave clear spectral or structural signatures -- conditions rarely present
after inundation. Consequently, existing models perform poorly at identifying
flood-related building damages. The model presented in this study,
Flood-DamageSense, addresses this gap as the first deep-learning framework
purpose-built for building-level flood-damage assessment. The architecture
fuses pre- and post-event SAR/InSAR scenes with very-high-resolution optical
basemaps and an inherent flood-risk layer that encodes long-term exposure
probabilities, guiding the network toward plausibly affected structures even
when compositional change is minimal. A multimodal Mamba backbone with a
semi-Siamese encoder and task-specific decoders jointly predicts (1) graded
building-damage states, (2) floodwater extent, and (3) building footprints.
Training and evaluation on Hurricane Harvey (2017) imagery from Harris County,
Texas -- supported by insurance-derived property-damage extents -- show a mean
F1 improvement of up to 19 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines,
with the largest gains in the frequently misclassified "minor" and "moderate"
damage categories. Ablation studies identify the inherent-risk feature as the
single most significant contributor to this performance boost. An end-to-end
post-processing pipeline converts pixel-level outputs to actionable,
building-scale damage maps within minutes of image acquisition. By combining
risk-aware modeling with SAR's all-weather capability, Flood-DamageSense
delivers faster, finer-grained, and more reliable flood-damage intelligence to
support post-disaster decision-making and resource allocation.

Conclusion: 该研究为胚胎评级提供了一种高效且可解释的AI解决方案，有望提升IVF的成功率。

Abstract: Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life,
affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise
in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the
primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address
the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade
embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer,
yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images
provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we
introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for
classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM.
Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo
classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

Abstract: Omnidirectional image and video super-resolution is a crucial research topic
in low-level vision, playing an essential role in virtual reality and augmented
reality applications. Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or
video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation
and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,
numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly
based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,
loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper
presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and
video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that
existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in
capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that
comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected
under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure
settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional
benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization
capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on
both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising
directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation
metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly
updated. Project page: https://github.com/nqian1/Survey-on-ODISR-and-ODVSR.

Motivation: 解决传统抛物线平均曲率流驱动的主动轮廓模型（PMCF-ACMs）对初始曲线配置依赖性强的问题。

Method: 提出HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs，利用可调初始速度场和光滑Heaviside函数进行边缘感知力调制，并通过加权四阶Runge-Kutta算法求解相关波动方程。

Conclusion: HMCF-ACMs和HDRF-ACMs通过自适应初始配置，显著提升了图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are
widely used in image segmentation, which however depend heavily on the
selection of initial curve configurations. In this paper, we firstly propose
several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce
tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse
segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows
and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations
and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance
function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic
dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth
Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion
near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta
algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the
above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and
HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise
resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of
initial velocities and initial contours.

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters
between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying
individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five
African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species.
The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a
closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their
predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To
this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric
contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and
projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare
our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show
feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying
classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features
achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the
best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉与语言结合方面取得了显著成功，但仍存在输出与图像内容不符的幻觉问题。

Method: 引入Local Perception Search (LPS)，一种简单且无需训练的解码方法，利用局部视觉先验信息修正解码过程。

Result: 在广泛使用的幻觉基准测试和噪声数据上，LPS显著减少了幻觉现象，尤其在噪声环境下表现突出。

Conclusion: LPS是一种即插即用的方法，适用于多种模型，有效抑制了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
them to effectively integrate vision and language, addressing a variety of
downstream tasks. However, despite their significant success, these models
still exhibit hallucination phenomena, where the outputs appear plausible but
do not align with the content of the images. To mitigate this issue, we
introduce Local Perception Search (LPS), a decoding method during inference
that is both simple and training-free, yet effectively suppresses
hallucinations. This method leverages local visual prior information as a value
function to correct the decoding process. Additionally, we observe that the
impact of the local visual prior on model performance is more pronounced in
scenarios with high levels of image noise. Notably, LPS is a plug-and-play
approach that is compatible with various models. Extensive experiments on
widely used hallucination benchmarks and noisy data demonstrate that LPS
significantly reduces the incidence of hallucinations compared to the baseline,
showing exceptional performance, particularly in noisy settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为SAR图像的高级信息检索提供了新思路，展示了结构建模在语义理解中的潜力。

Abstract: To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms
for human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information
retrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local
geometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural
modeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:
SAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target
and the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry
and adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural
consistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed
in different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of
target directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a
two-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.
Specifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real
SAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical
structures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are
integrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results
validated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,
that 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly
derived from a single-view SAR image.

Result: LitMAS仅需6M参数，在七个数据集上的平均EER比现有方法低1.36%，表现出高效性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LitMAS为多模态生物识别反欺骗提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，适合边缘部署。

Abstract: Biometric authentication systems are increasingly being deployed in critical
applications, but they remain susceptible to spoofing. Since most of the
research efforts focus on modality-specific anti-spoofing techniques, building
a unified, resource-efficient solution across multiple biometric modalities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose LitMAS, a
$\textbf{Li}$gh$\textbf{t}$ weight and generalizable $\textbf{M}$ulti-modal
$\textbf{A}$nti-$\textbf{S}$poofing framework designed to detect spoofing
attacks in speech, face, iris, and fingerprint-based biometric systems. At the
core of LitMAS is a Modality-Aligned Concentration Loss, which enhances
inter-class separability while preserving cross-modal consistency and enabling
robust spoof detection across diverse biometric traits. With just 6M
parameters, LitMAS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by $1.36\%$ in average
EER across seven datasets, demonstrating high efficiency, strong
generalizability, and suitability for edge deployment. Code and trained models

Motivation: SO(3)旋转的跟踪和预测在计算机视觉和机器人学中至关重要，但现有方法受限于噪声观测、复杂动态和长期预测需求。

Method: 使用神经控制微分方程结合Savitzky-Golay路径，在SO(3)上建模连续时间旋转动态，学习潜在动态系统并保持旋转几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为SO(3)旋转预测提供了一种通用且几何结构保持的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking and forecasting the rotation of objects is fundamental in computer
vision and robotics, yet SO(3) extrapolation remains challenging as (1) sensor
observations can be noisy and sparse, (2) motion patterns can be governed by
complex dynamics, and (3) application settings can demand long-term

dynamics on $SO(3)$ using Neural Controlled Differential Equations guided by
Savitzky-Golay paths. Unlike existing methods that rely on simplified motion
assumptions, our method learns a general latent dynamical system of the
underlying object trajectory while respecting the geometric structure of
rotations. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate compelling
forecasting capabilities compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格迁移技术在保持身份的同时实现高质量风格化方面存在不足，尤其在面部较小或相机距离较远的图像中表现不佳。

Method: 采用“马赛克恢复内容图像”技术和无需训练的内容一致性损失，增强身份保留和内容细节保护。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高风格保真度和身份完整性方面显著优于基线模型，尤其适用于小面部或远距离场景。

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需重新训练或微调，即可在复杂场景中实现高质量的身份保持风格化。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities,
existing style transfer techniques often struggle to maintain identity while
achieving high-quality stylization. This limitation is particularly acute for
images where faces are small or exhibit significant camera-to-face distances,
frequently leading to inadequate identity preservation. To address this, we
introduce a novel, training-free framework for identity-preserved stylized
image synthesis using diffusion models. Key contributions include: (1) the
"Mosaic Restored Content Image" technique, significantly enhancing identity
retention, especially in complex scenes; and (2) a training-free content
consistency loss that enhances the preservation of fine-grained content details
by directing more attention to the original image during stylization. Our
experiments reveal that the proposed approach substantially surpasses the
baseline model in concurrently maintaining high stylistic fidelity and robust
identity integrity, particularly under conditions of small facial regions or
significant camera-to-face distances, all without necessitating model
retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: 在多个伪装目标分割基准上取得最优结果，推理速度更快。

Conclusion: RDVP-MSD无需训练即可显著提升分割精度和效率，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: While promptable segmentation (\textit{e.g.}, SAM) has shown promise for
various segmentation tasks, it still requires manual visual prompts for each
object to be segmented. In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims
to reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic
prompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to
Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical
issues: 1) \textit{\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text
prompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic
captions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)
\textit{\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in
getting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global
background sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,
causing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we
propose \textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework
that synergizes \textbf{R}egion-constrained \textbf{D}ual-stream
\textbf{V}isual \textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \textbf{M}ultimodal
\textbf{S}tepwise \textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT). MSD-CoT
progressively disentangles image captions to eliminate semantic ambiguity,
while RDVP injects spatial constraints into visual prompting and independently
samples visual prompts for foreground and background points, effectively
mitigating semantic discrepancy and spatial separation. Without requiring any
training or supervision, RDVP-MSD achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation
result on multiple COS benchmarks and delivers a faster inference speed than
previous methods, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 实验表明Hi-LSplat在3D开放词汇分割和定位中表现优越，尤其在分层语义数据集上。

Conclusion: Hi-LSplat能够有效捕捉3D场景中的复杂分层语义，解决了视图不一致和语义层次问题。

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language
queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based
models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but
lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies.
Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in
object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic
understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent
Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying.
To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features
to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered
instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D
semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise
contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations.
Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the
model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments
highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and
localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets
underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D
scenes.

Result: 实验表明，PBL能有效继承源模型的鲁棒性，并显著提升VP在下游任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PBL是一种通用且有效的策略，适用于VP在鲁棒源模型下的应用。

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown
its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP
from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the
scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be
successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between
robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process?
If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to
mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three
questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To
mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt
Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally
compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of
robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly
enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets.
Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are
universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Motivation: 解决多图像生成中背景耦合与对象灵活性的平衡问题。

Method: 通过解耦背景与实体组件，结合时间变化的权重控制参数优化生成过程。

Result: 在背景耦合、文本对齐和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了背景一致性与对象多样性的平衡。

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image
generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images
are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds
coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to
enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method
disentangles the background and entity components in the model's
cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight
control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this
sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses
how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall
visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches across these criteria.

Conclusion: EndoARSS有望推动AI驱动的内窥镜手术系统发展，提升手术安全性和效率。

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally
invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection
and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes,
characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and
confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges
for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often
struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in
each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task
learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance
overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel
multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery
activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2
foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate
efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank
Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we
introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature
representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global
information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we
present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored
for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity
recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks,
significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing
models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven
endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical
safety and efficiency.

*Zelin He,Sarah Alnegheimish,Matthew Reimherr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的两阶段时间序列异常检测方法，结合轻量级视觉编码器和VLM推理能力，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏视觉-时间推理能力，无法像人类专家一样识别上下文异常，因此探索基于VLM的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）ViT4TS（轻量级视觉编码器）定位候选异常；2）VLM4TS（VLM阶段）整合全局时间上下文和VLM推理能力优化检测。

Result: VLM4TS在未进行时间序列训练的情况下，F1-max分数比最佳基线提升24.6%，且效率更高（令牌使用量平均减少36倍）。

Conclusion: 基于VLM的两阶段方法在时间序列异常检测中表现出色，兼具高准确性和高效性。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of
fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior
methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical
data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to
identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on
vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs
for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has
fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for
TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening
stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which
leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate
anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal
context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates
provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS
outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases,
yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline.
Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based
TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Multi-StyleGS的新方法，用于在3D高斯泼溅（GS）场景中实现多风格化，同时保持内存效率和细节表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅技术在风格化中的挑战，如自动局部风格转移、多风格匹配和内存效率问题。

Method: 采用二分匹配机制自动匹配风格图像与渲染图像的局部区域，引入语义风格损失函数和局部-全局特征匹配以增强多视角一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在风格化效果和编辑灵活性上优于现有方法，同时实现了内存高效训练和更好的纹理细节。

Conclusion: Multi-StyleGS为3D场景风格化提供了高效、灵活且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene
to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes.
While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method
for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to
stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style
transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for
stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization
solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we
employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify
correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered
images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style
loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to
various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to
enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve
memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To
better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several
techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our
comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing
plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.

Motivation: 传统惯性动作捕捉系统依赖复杂模型和昂贵软件，研究旨在通过神经网络简化流程并降低成本。

Result: Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick方法表现最佳，误差为7.96，接近现有融合滤波器水平。

Conclusion: 神经网络可以替代复杂模型，实现高精度姿态估计，且成本更低。

Abstract: Inertial-based Motion capture system has been attracting growing attention
due to its wearability and unsconstrained use. However, accurate human joint
estimation demands several complex and expertise demanding steps, which leads
to expensive software such as the state-of-the-art MVN Awinda from Xsens
Technologies. This work aims to study the use of Neural Networks to abstract
the complex biomechanical models and analytical mathematics required for pose
estimation. Thus, it presents a comparison of different Neural Network
architectures and methodologies to understand how accurately these methods can
estimate human pose, using both low cost(MPU9250) and high end (Mtw Awinda)
Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity (MARG) sensors. The most efficient method
was the Hybrid LSTM-Madgwick detached, which achieved an Quaternion Angle
distance error of 7.96, using Mtw Awinda data. Also, an ablation study was
conducted to study the impact of data augmentation, output representation,
window size, loss function and magnetometer data on the pose estimation error.
This work indicates that Neural Networks can be trained to estimate human pose,
with results comparable to the state-of-the-art fusion filters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于位置预测的自监督学习方法LOCA，用于多模态卫星图像语义分割，显著优于现有基于重建的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像的语义分割对地球观测应用至关重要，但受限于标记数据不足。现有自监督预训练方法（如MAE）侧重于重建而非定位，而定位是分割任务的核心。

Method: 扩展SatMAE的通道分组至多模态数据，引入同组注意力掩码以促进跨模态交互，并采用相对补丁位置预测任务以增强空间推理能力。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11洪水映射数据集上，该方法显著优于基于重建的自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 针对多模态卫星图像的位置预测任务能学习到更适合语义分割的表示，优于重建方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation
applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While
self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown
promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental
aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a
position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite
imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of
satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to
multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and
introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction
during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction,
encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it
significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised
learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position
prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn
representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than
reconstruction-based approaches.

Conclusion: 解码器专用网络和‘过预测’策略有效提升了轨迹预测性能，为自动驾驶提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the motion of other agents in a scene is highly relevant for
autonomous driving, as it allows a self-driving car to anticipate. Inspired by
the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a
Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing
encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and
predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the
model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that
the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the
performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language
modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the
auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This
allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the
performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach
outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art
results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.

Result: 在Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark上性能提升5%，显著加速训练收敛速度和效率。

Conclusion: Vision-EKIPL克服了传统强化学习方法的局限性，为多模态大语言模型的视觉推理研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is crucial for understanding complex multimodal data and
advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Existing methods enhance the
reasoning capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through
Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning (e.g., GRPO). However, current RL
approaches sample action groups solely from the policy model itself, which
limits the upper boundary of the model's reasoning capability and leads to
inefficient training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
RL framework called \textbf{Vision-EKIPL}. The core of this framework lies in
introducing high-quality actions generated by external auxiliary models during
the RL training process to guide the optimization of the policy model. The
policy learning with knowledge infusion from external models significantly
expands the model's exploration space, effectively improves the reasoning
boundary, and substantially accelerates training convergence speed and
efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Vision-EKIPL
achieved up to a 5\% performance improvement on the Reason-RFT-CoT Benchmark
compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA). It reveals that Vision-EKIPL can
overcome the limitations of traditional RL methods, significantly enhance the
visual reasoning performance of MLLMs, and provide a new effective paradigm for
research in this field.

Result: 在Bosphorus数据集上验证，识别精度显著提升，最高增益达14.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了噪声点云下的3D人脸识别问题。

Abstract: Face recognition using 3D point clouds is gaining growing interest, while raw
point clouds often contain a significant amount of noise due to imperfect
sensors. In this paper, an end-to-end 3D face recognition on a noisy point
cloud is proposed, which synergistically integrates the denoising and
recognition modules. Specifically, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
on Three Orthogonal Planes (cGAN-TOP) is designed to effectively remove the
noise in the point cloud, and recover the underlying features for subsequent
recognition. A Linked Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (LDGCNN) is
then adapted to recognize faces from the processed point cloud, which
hierarchically links both the local point features and neighboring features of
multiple scales. The proposed method is validated on the Bosphorus dataset. It
significantly improves the recognition accuracy under all noise settings, with
a maximum gain of 14.81%.

Abstract: Accurate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is vital for early

TL;DR: NSD-Imagery是一个新发布的基准数据集，用于评估从fMRI活动重建心理图像的能力，补充了现有的NSD数据集。研究发现，心理图像重建的性能与视觉重建解耦，且简单线性解码架构在跨解码任务中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型仅针对视觉图像重建进行评估，而心理图像重建对医学和脑机接口应用至关重要。NSD-Imagery填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用NSD-Imagery数据集评估了多种NSD训练的开源视觉解码模型（如MindEye1、Brain Diffuser等），比较了它们在心理图像重建中的表现。

Result: 心理图像重建性能与视觉重建解耦，简单线性解码架构和多模态特征解码表现更优，复杂架构容易过拟合。

Conclusion: 心理图像数据集对实际应用至关重要，NSD-Imagery为视觉解码方法的优化提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We release NSD-Imagery, a benchmark dataset of human fMRI activity paired
with mental images, to complement the existing Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), a
large-scale dataset of fMRI activity paired with seen images that enabled
unprecedented improvements in fMRI-to-image reconstruction efforts. Recent
models trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.
Using NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on
mental image reconstruction. This is a challenging generalization requirement
because mental images are encoded in human brain activity with relatively lower
signal-to-noise and spatial resolution; however, generalization from seen to
mental imagery is critical for real-world applications in medical domains and
brain-computer interfaces, where the desired information is always internally
generated. We provide benchmarks for a suite of recent NSD-trained open-source
visual decoding models (MindEye1, MindEye2, Brain Diffuser, iCNN, Takagi et
al.) on NSD-Imagery, and show that the performance of decoding methods on
mental images is largely decoupled from performance on vision reconstruction.
We further demonstrate that architectural choices significantly impact
cross-decoding performance: models employing simple linear decoding
architectures and multimodal feature decoding generalize better to mental
imagery, while complex architectures tend to overfit visual training data. Our
findings indicate that mental imagery datasets are critical for the development
of practical applications, and establish NSD-Imagery as a useful resource for
better aligning visual decoding methods with this goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在3D点云数据分析中表现出色，但对对抗攻击（如点丢弃、移动和添加）的脆弱性影响了3D视觉系统的可靠性。

Method: 基于流形假设和特征空间的最近邻搜索，KNN-Defense通过训练集中邻近样本的语义相似性恢复受扰动的输入。

Conclusion: KNN-Defense为增强3D点云分类器的对抗鲁棒性提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
analyzing 3D point cloud data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge
to the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the
semantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing
defense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named
KNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and
nearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface
geometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores
perturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples
from the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally
efficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and
practical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset
demonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various
attack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing
methods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the
proposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on
PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively. These findings suggest that
KNN-Defense offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the
adversarial resilience of 3D point cloud classifiers. (An open-source
implementation of the method, including code and data, is available at
https://github.com/nimajam41/3d-knn-defense).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯泼溅技术主要适用于静态场景，对长期动态场景（如场景在视野外演化）的研究较少，因此需要一种能够持续更新3D表示并保持几何和语义一致性的方法。

Method: 提出动态场景适应机制以持续更新3D表示，并设计关键帧管理机制以丢弃过时观测信息。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比现有技术更准确。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长期动态场景的挑战，提升了3D高斯泼溅技术的性能。

Abstract: Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used
in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving
applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS
performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes.
While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within
the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes
out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D
representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining
geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale
observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe
management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as
much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes
(GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more
accurate than the state of the art.

Motivation: 传统多导睡眠图（PSG）依赖复杂设备，难以在家中使用。研究旨在探索PSM和EOG作为更便捷的替代方案，以解决家庭睡眠监测的挑战。

Method: 利用ImageBind模型整合PSM和双通道EOG数据，首次将这两种模态结合用于睡眠阶段分类。

Conclusion: 预训练多模态嵌入模型可有效用于睡眠分期，为家庭睡眠监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for diagnosing sleep
disorders, particularly in aging populations. While traditional polysomnography
(PSG) relies on electroencephalography (EEG) as the gold standard, its
complexity and need for specialized equipment make home-based sleep monitoring
challenging. To address this limitation, we investigate the use of
electrooculography (EOG) and pressure-sensitive mats (PSM) as less obtrusive
alternatives for five-stage sleep-wake classification. This study introduces a
novel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning
model, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage
classification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and
EOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind. Our results demonstrate
that fine-tuning ImageBind significantly improves classification accuracy,
outperforming existing models based on single-channel EOG (DeepSleepNet),
exclusively PSM data (ViViT), and other multimodal deep learning approaches
(MBT). Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,
highlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,
making it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our
method using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic. Our findings
suggest that pre-trained multimodal embedding models, even those originally
developed for non-medical domains, can be effectively adapted for sleep
staging, with accuracies approaching systems that require complex EEG data.

Result: 在低光环境下优于传统OCR，带宽减少2400倍。

Conclusion: 事件相机结合眼动注视点是智能眼镜OCR的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current smart glasses equipped with RGB cameras struggle to perceive the
environment in low-light and high-speed motion scenarios due to motion blur and
the limited dynamic range of frame cameras. Additionally, capturing dense
images with a frame camera requires large bandwidth and power consumption,
consequently draining the battery faster. These challenges are especially
relevant for developing algorithms that can read text from images. In this
work, we propose a novel event-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
approach for smart glasses. By using the eye gaze of the user, we foveate the
event stream to significantly reduce bandwidth by around 98% while exploiting
the benefits of event cameras in high-dynamic and fast scenes. Our proposed
method performs deep binary reconstruction trained on synthetic data and
leverages multimodal LLMs for OCR, outperforming traditional OCR solutions. Our
results demonstrate the ability to read text in low light environments where
RGB cameras struggle while using up to 2400 times less bandwidth than a
wearable RGB camera.

Abstract: Research into Video Large Language Models (LLMs) has progressed rapidly, with
numerous models and benchmarks emerging in just a few years. Typically, these
models are initialized with a pretrained text-only LLM and finetuned on both
image- and video-caption datasets. In this paper, we present findings
indicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after
image-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from
video-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that
image-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm
perform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning
benchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving
sequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.
This baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and
occasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests
suboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current
models. Our analysis motivates further research into the mechanisms that allow
image-trained LLMs to perform temporal reasoning, as well as into the
bottlenecks that render current video training schemes inefficient.

### [180] [Polar Hierarchical Mamba: Towards Streaming LiDAR Object Detection with Point Clouds as Egocentric Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06944)
*Mellon M. Zhang,Glen Chou,Saibal Mukhopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHiM是一种新型状态空间模型架构，专为极坐标流式LiDAR设计，通过局部双向Mamba块和全局前向Mamba块实现高效检测，性能优于现有流式检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要低延迟、高吞吐的实时感知，传统LiDAR处理方法存在延迟问题，流式方法虽能缓解但性能受限。

Method: PHiM采用局部双向Mamba块进行空间编码和全局前向Mamba块进行时间建模，替代传统卷积和位置编码。

Result: PHiM在Waymo Open Dataset上性能提升10%，吞吐量翻倍，匹配全扫描基线。

Conclusion: PHiM为流式LiDAR检测提供了高效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient object detection is essential for autonomous vehicles,
where real-time perception requires low latency and high throughput. LiDAR
sensors provide robust depth information, but conventional methods process full
360{\deg} scans in a single pass, introducing significant delay. Streaming
approaches address this by sequentially processing partial scans in the native
polar coordinate system, yet they rely on translation-invariant convolutions
that are misaligned with polar geometry -- resulting in degraded performance or
requiring complex distortion mitigation. Recent Mamba-based state space models
(SSMs) have shown promise for LiDAR perception, but only in the full-scan
setting, relying on geometric serialization and positional embeddings that are
memory-intensive and ill-suited to streaming. We propose Polar Hierarchical
Mamba (PHiM), a novel SSM architecture designed for polar-coordinate streaming
LiDAR. PHiM uses local bidirectional Mamba blocks for intra-sector spatial
encoding and a global forward Mamba for inter-sector temporal modeling,
replacing convolutions and positional encodings with distortion-aware,
dimensionally-decomposed operations. PHiM sets a new state-of-the-art among
streaming detectors on the Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming the previous best
by 10\% and matching full-scan baselines at twice the throughput. Code will be
available at https://github.com/meilongzhang/Polar-Hierarchical-Mamba .

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models unifying image understanding
and generation have opened exciting avenues for tackling a wide range of
vision-language tasks within a single framework. Despite progress, existing
unified models typically require extensive pretraining and struggle to achieve
the same level of performance compared to models dedicated to each task.
Additionally, many of these models suffer from slow image generation speeds,
limiting their practical deployment in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. In this work, we propose Layerwise Timestep-Expert Flow-based
Transformer (LaTtE-Flow), a novel and efficient architecture that unifies image
understanding and generation within a single multimodal model. LaTtE-Flow
builds upon powerful pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to inherit strong
multimodal understanding capabilities, and extends them with a novel Layerwise
Timestep Experts flow-based architecture for efficient image generation.
LaTtE-Flow distributes the flow-matching process across specialized groups of
Transformer layers, each responsible for a distinct subset of timesteps. This
design significantly improves sampling efficiency by activating only a small
subset of layers at each sampling timestep. To further enhance performance, we
propose a Timestep-Conditioned Residual Attention mechanism for efficient
information reuse across layers. Experiments demonstrate that LaTtE-Flow
achieves strong performance on multimodal understanding tasks, while achieving
competitive image generation quality with around 6x faster inference speed
compared to recent unified multimodal models.

Conclusion: 多目标优化有助于缩小模拟训练与真实部署之间的差距，提升超分辨率模型的实用性。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution refers to the reconstruction of a
high-resolution image from a single low-resolution observation. Although recent
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated notable success on simulated
datasets -- with low-resolution images obtained by degrading and downsampling
high-resolution ones -- they frequently fail to generalize to real-world
settings, such as document scans, which are affected by complex degradations
and semantic variability. In this study, we introduce a task-driven, multi-task
learning framework for training a super-resolution network specifically
optimized for optical character recognition tasks. We propose to incorporate
auxiliary loss functions derived from high-level vision tasks, including text
detection using the connectionist text proposal network, text recognition via a
convolutional recurrent neural network, keypoints localization using Key.Net,
and hue consistency. To balance these diverse objectives, we employ dynamic
weight averaging mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the relative importance of
each loss term based on its convergence behavior. We validate our approach upon
the SRResNet architecture, which is a well-established technique for
single-image super-resolution. Experimental evaluations on both simulated and
real-world scanned document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
improves text detection, measured with intersection over union, while
preserving overall image fidelity. These findings underscore the value of
multi-objective optimization in super-resolution models for bridging the gap
between simulated training regimes and practical deployment in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: AR-RAG是一种新的图像生成方法，通过自回归方式在生成过程中动态检索并融合最相关的图像块，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成方法通常基于静态检索，容易导致过度复制或风格偏差，AR-RAG旨在通过动态检索提升生成质量和灵活性。

Method: 提出两种框架：DAiD（直接融合预测块和检索块的分布）和FAiD（通过多尺度卷积平滑检索块特征并用于生成）。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如Midjourney-30K）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AR-RAG通过动态检索和融合机制显著提升了图像生成的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Autoregressive Retrieval Augmentation (AR-RAG), a novel paradigm
that enhances image generation by autoregressively incorporating knearest
neighbor retrievals at the patch level. Unlike prior methods that perform a
single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation
on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each
generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and
incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model
to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g.,
over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize
AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in
Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly
merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of
retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features
of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them
to augment the image generation process. We validate the effectiveness of
AR-RAG on widely adopted benchmarks, including Midjourney-30K, GenEval and
DPG-Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
image generation models.

Result: 实验证明数据集和基线模型有效，融合策略显著提升性能，但序列模型难以从双视角视频中学习互补特征。

Conclusion: 双视角数据集和融合策略为孤立手语识别提供了新方向，但序列模型仍需改进。

Abstract: Due to the emergence of many sign language datasets, isolated sign language
recognition (ISLR) has made significant progress in recent years. In addition,
the development of various advanced deep neural networks is another reason for
this breakthrough. However, challenges remain in applying the technique in the
real world. First, existing sign language datasets do not cover the whole sign
vocabulary. Second, most of the sign language datasets provide only single view
RGB videos, which makes it difficult to handle hand occlusions when performing
ISLR. To fill this gap, this paper presents a dual-view sign language dataset
for ISLR named NationalCSL-DP, which fully covers the Chinese national sign
language vocabulary. The dataset consists of 134140 sign videos recorded by ten
signers with respect to two vertical views, namely, the front side and the left
side. Furthermore, a CNN transformer network is also proposed as a strong
baseline and an extremely simple but effective fusion strategy for prediction.
Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the datasets
as well as the baseline. The results show that the proposed fusion strategy can
significantly increase the performance of the ISLR, but it is not easy for the
sequence-to-sequence model, regardless of whether the early-fusion or
late-fusion strategy is applied, to learn the complementary features from the
sign videos of two vertical views.

TL;DR: MAPLE利用MLLM的细粒度对齐先验指导跨模态表示学习，通过强化学习和新的RPA损失显著提升细粒度跨模态检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP在多模态检索中表现优异，但仍存在模态差距。MLLM具有强大的模态对齐能力，但现有方法依赖粗粒度对齐机制，限制了潜力。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，利用MLLM自动构建偏好数据，并设计RPA损失，将DPO应用于嵌入学习。

Result: 实验表明，MAPLE在细粒度跨模态检索中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过偏好引导的对齐机制，有效处理细微语义差异，为跨模态表示学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability
to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in
its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs
(Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality
alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified
architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality
alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We
introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel
framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to
guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning
process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic
preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative
Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our
preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained
cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced
semantic distinctions.

Conclusion: 混合表示方法有效平衡渲染效率与质量，适用于室内场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in
image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with
complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color
variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address
this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that
combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle
texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate
geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted
mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint
optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and
transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions
seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation
maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second
FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成对抗样本时未能充分利用代理模型的共享和独特特征，导致迁移性能不佳。因此，研究如何增强共享信息并抑制个体特征，以提高对抗样本的迁移性。

Method: COGO策略包括两部分：共性增强（CE）和个体抑制（IS）。CE通过扰动中低频区域增强共享特征，IS通过自适应阈值评估梯度相关性并加权。

Result: 实验表明，COGO显著提高了对抗攻击的迁移成功率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COGO通过优化共享和个体特征，有效提升了对抗样本的迁移性，为ViTs的对抗性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for
understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs).
However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit
weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods
improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform
gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully
leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the
same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing
perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing
those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve
transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient
optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality
Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low
frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset
tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS
employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated
gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer
success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Dual-camera super-resolution is highly practical for smartphone photography
that primarily super-resolve the wide-angle images using the telephoto image as

To bridge the domain gap between the high-resolution domain and the degraded
domain, we learn two compressed global representations from image pairs
corresponding to the two domains. To enable reliable transfer of high-frequency
structural details from the reference image, we design a multi-scale matching
module that conducts patch-level feature matching and retrieval across multiple
receptive fields to improve matching accuracy and robustness. Moreover, we also
introduce Key Pruning to achieve a significant reduction in memory usage and
inference time with little model performance sacrificed. Experimental results
on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DM$^3$Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度竞争力强。

Conclusion: BePo有效结合BEV和稀疏点优势，提升3D占用预测性能与效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover,
BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest
efficient approaches.

Abstract: This work presents UNO, a unified monocular visual odometry framework that
enables robust and adaptable pose estimation across diverse environments,

deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach
generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including

this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state
estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class

Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph,
selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues
are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained,
scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to
enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three
major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV
(indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in audio-visual
understanding, yet they struggle with real-world scenarios that require complex
reasoning across extensive video collections. Existing benchmarks for video
question answering remain limited in scope, typically involving one clip per
query, which falls short of representing the challenges of large-scale,
audio-visual retrieval and reasoning encountered in practical applications. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task named AV-HaystacksQA, where the goal
is to identify salient segments across different videos in response to a query
and link them together to generate the most informative answer. To this end, we
present AVHaystacks, an audio-visual benchmark comprising 3100 annotated QA
pairs designed to assess the capabilities of LMMs in multi-video retrieval and
temporal grounding task. Additionally, we propose a model-agnostic, multi-agent
framework MAGNET to address this challenge, achieving up to 89% and 65%
relative improvements over baseline methods on BLEU@4 and GPT evaluation scores
in QA task on our proposed AVHaystacks. To enable robust evaluation of
multi-video retrieval and temporal grounding for optimal response generation,
we introduce two new metrics, STEM, which captures alignment errors between a
ground truth and a predicted step sequence and MTGS, to facilitate balanced and
interpretable evaluation of segment-level grounding performance. Project:

*Yikun Ji,Hong Yan,Jun Lan,Huijia Zhu,Weiqiang Wang,Qi Fan,Liqing Zhang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，用于检测AI生成图像并提供可解释的视觉定位和文本解释。通过构建标注数据集和多阶段优化策略，模型在检测和定位性能上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法多为黑箱，缺乏可解释性；MLLMs虽具备分析能力，但在视觉解释与人类推理对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 构建带有边界框和描述性标注的数据集，通过多阶段优化策略微调MLLMs，平衡检测准确性、视觉定位和文本解释。

Result: 模型在检测AI生成图像和定位视觉缺陷方面表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了检测性能，还实现了可解释的视觉-文本对齐推理，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image generation technologies intensifies the demand
for interpretable and robust detection methods. Although existing approaches
often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without
providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit
strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they
can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations.
However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to
align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human
reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images
annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis
artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded
reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy
that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual
localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves
superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing
visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

*Zheng Wang,Kai Ying,Bin Xu,Chunjiao Wang,Cong Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PRE-Net的两阶段模型，通过多模态知识扩展技术提升红外降水反演的精度和范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外降水反演算法精度低，而微波和雷达方法范围有限，因此需要开发一种能在全盘范围内实现高精度红外降水反演的技术。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 扫描带蒸馏阶段，通过CoMWE从多模态数据中提取知识；2) 全盘适应阶段，通过Self-MaskTune平衡多模态和红外知识。

Result: PRE-Net在PRE基准测试中表现优异，超越了PERSIANN-CCS、PDIR和IMERG等主流产品。

Conclusion: PRE-Net为红外降水反演提供了高精度和全盘覆盖的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate near-real-time precipitation retrieval has been enhanced by
satellite-based technologies. However, infrared-based algorithms have low
accuracy due to weak relations with surface precipitation, whereas passive
microwave and radar-based methods are more accurate but limited in range. This
challenge motivates the Precipitation Retrieval Expansion (PRE) task, which
aims to enable accurate, infrared-based full-disc precipitation retrievals
beyond the scanning swath. We introduce Multimodal Knowledge Expansion, a
two-stage pipeline with the proposed PRE-Net model. In the Swath-Distilling
stage, PRE-Net transfers knowledge from a multimodal data integration model to
an infrared-based model within the scanning swath via Coordinated Masking and
Wavelet Enhancement (CoMWE). In the Full-Disc Adaptation stage, Self-MaskTune
refines predictions across the full disc by balancing multimodal and full-disc
infrared knowledge. Experiments on the introduced PRE benchmark demonstrate
that PRE-Net significantly advanced precipitation retrieval performance,
outperforming leading products like PERSIANN-CCS, PDIR, and IMERG. The code
will be available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/PRE-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练教师网络，而LSSKD旨在通过自监督知识蒸馏提升紧凑模型的性能，减少对大型教师网络的依赖。

Method: 在中间特征图上添加辅助分类器，生成多样化的自监督知识，并实现跨网络阶段的一对一知识转移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上平均提升4.54%，ImageNet上提升0.32%，在少样本学习场景下也达到SOTA。

Conclusion: LSSKD有效提升模型泛化能力和性能，且推理时无额外计算成本，适用于低计算设备和多模态环境。

Abstract: We introduce Layered Self-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (LSSKD) framework
for training compact deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods that rely
on pre-trained teacher networks, our approach appends auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate feature maps, generating diverse self-supervised knowledge and
enabling one-to-one transfer across different network stages. Our method
achieves an average improvement of 4.54\% over the state-of-the-art PS-KD
method and a 1.14% gain over SSKD on CIFAR-100, with a 0.32% improvement on
ImageNet compared to HASSKD. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR-100 under
few-shot learning scenarios also achieve state-of-the-art results. These
findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing model
generalization and performance without the need for large over-parameterized
teacher networks. Importantly, at the inference stage, all auxiliary
classifiers can be removed, yielding no extra computational cost. This makes
our model suitable for deploying small language models on affordable
low-computing devices. Owing to its lightweight design and adaptability, our
framework is particularly suitable for multimodal sensing and cyber-physical
environments that require efficient and responsive inference. LSSKD facilitates
the development of intelligent agents capable of learning from limited sensory
data under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双正则化损失（D2R Loss）和协作对抗生成（CAG）策略，用于增强深度神经网络模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在目标模型损失函数引导不足和非协作对抗生成的问题，需要改进。

Method: D2R Loss通过对抗分布和干净分布优化增强模型鲁棒性；CAG通过梯度协作生成对抗样本。

Result: 在多个基准数据库和目标模型上的实验表明，D2R Loss与CAG结合能显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D2R Loss和CAG策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: The robustness of Deep Neural Network models is crucial for defending models
against adversarial attacks. Recent defense methods have employed collaborative
learning frameworks to enhance model robustness. Two key limitations of
existing methods are (i) insufficient guidance of the target model via loss
functions and (ii) non-collaborative adversarial generation. We, therefore,
propose a dual regularization loss (D2R Loss) method and a collaborative
adversarial generation (CAG) strategy for adversarial training. D2R loss
includes two optimization steps. The adversarial distribution and clean
distribution optimizations enhance the target model's robustness by leveraging
the strengths of different loss functions obtained via a suitable function
space exploration to focus more precisely on the target model's distribution.
CAG generates adversarial samples using a gradient-based collaboration between
guidance and target models. We conducted extensive experiments on three
benchmark databases, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and two
popular target models, WideResNet34-10 and PreActResNet18. Our results show
that D2R loss with CAG produces highly robust models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率地球观测数据的增多带来了处理和标注的挑战，IGN希望通过FLAIR-HUB解决这一问题，支持多模态学习和精细分类。

Method: IGN构建了FLAIR-HUB数据集，包含六种对齐模态数据，并评估了多模态融合和深度学习模型（如CNN和Transformer）的性能。

Result: 最佳土地覆盖分类性能达到78.2%准确率和65.8% mIoU，几乎使用了所有模态数据。

Conclusion: FLAIR-HUB为土地覆盖和作物监测提供了强大的多模态数据集，支持监督学习和预训练，数据与代码已公开。

Abstract: The growing availability of high-quality Earth Observation (EO) data enables
accurate global land cover and crop type monitoring. However, the volume and
heterogeneity of these datasets pose major processing and annotation
challenges. To address this, the French National Institute of Geographical and
Forest Information (IGN) is actively exploring innovative strategies to exploit
diverse EO data, which require large annotated datasets. IGN introduces
FLAIR-HUB, the largest multi-sensor land cover dataset with
very-high-resolution (20 cm) annotations, covering 2528 km2 of France. It
combines six aligned modalities: aerial imagery, Sentinel-1/2 time series, SPOT
imagery, topographic data, and historical aerial images. Extensive benchmarks
evaluate multimodal fusion and deep learning models (CNNs, transformers) for
land cover or crop mapping and also explore multi-task learning. Results
underscore the complexity of multimodal fusion and fine-grained classification,
with best land cover performance (78.2% accuracy, 65.8% mIoU) achieved using
nearly all modalities. FLAIR-HUB supports supervised and multimodal
pretraining, with data and code available at

*Weiqi Yan,Lvhai Chen,Huaijia Kou,Shengchuan Zhang,Yan Zhang,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督伪装目标检测方法UCOD-DPL，通过动态伪标签学习和教师-学生框架解决现有方法的噪声问题和简单解码器不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督伪装目标检测方法依赖固定策略生成伪标签并使用简单解码器，导致性能低下，主要问题包括伪标签噪声和语义特征捕捉不足。

Method: 提出UCOD-DPL方法，包含自适应伪标签模块（APM）、双分支对抗解码器（DBA）和Look-Twice机制，动态优化伪标签并提升特征学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，甚至超越部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: UCOD-DPL通过动态伪标签学习和复杂解码器设计，显著提升了无监督伪装目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Camoflaged Object Detection (UCOD) has gained attention since it
doesn't need to rely on extensive pixel-level labels. Existing UCOD methods
typically generate pseudo-labels using fixed strategies and train 1 x1
convolutional layers as a simple decoder, leading to low performance compared
to fully-supervised methods. We emphasize two drawbacks in these approaches:
1). The model is prone to fitting incorrect knowledge due to the pseudo-label
containing substantial noise. 2). The simple decoder fails to capture and learn
the semantic features of camouflaged objects, especially for small-sized
objects, due to the low-resolution pseudo-labels and severe confusion between
foreground and background pixels. To this end, we propose a UCOD method with a
teacher-student framework via Dynamic Pseudo-label Learning called UCOD-DPL,
which contains an Adaptive Pseudo-label Module (APM), a Dual-Branch Adversarial
(DBA) decoder, and a Look-Twice mechanism. The APM module adaptively combines
pseudo-labels generated by fixed strategies and the teacher model to prevent
the model from overfitting incorrect knowledge while preserving the ability for
self-correction; the DBA decoder takes adversarial learning of different
segmentation objectives, guides the model to overcome the foreground-background
confusion of camouflaged objects, and the Look-Twice mechanism mimics the human
tendency to zoom in on camouflaged objects and performs secondary refinement on
small-sized objects. Extensive experiments show that our method demonstrates
outstanding performance, even surpassing some existing fully supervised
methods. The code is available now.

*Yangkai Lin,Jiabao Lei,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneLCM是一个端到端框架，结合LLM进行布局设计和LCM进行场景优化，解决了现有室内场景生成方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在室内场景合成中存在编辑限制、物理不一致、人力需求高、单房间限制和材质质量差等问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 分解场景生成为四个模块化流程：布局生成（LLM引导）、家具生成（CTS损失）、环境优化（多分辨率纹理场）和物理编辑（物理模拟）。

Result: 实验证明SceneLCM优于现有技术，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Conclusion: SceneLCM通过模块化设计和优化技术，显著提升了室内场景生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Our project page: https://scutyklin.github.io/SceneLCM/. Automated generation
of complex, interactive indoor scenes tailored to user prompt remains a
formidable challenge. While existing methods achieve indoor scene synthesis,
they struggle with rigid editing constraints, physical incoherence, excessive
human effort, single-room limitations, and suboptimal material quality. To
address these limitations, we propose SceneLCM, an end-to-end framework that
synergizes Large Language Model (LLM) for layout design with Latent Consistency
Model(LCM) for scene optimization. Our approach decomposes scene generation
into four modular pipelines: (1) Layout Generation. We employ LLM-guided 3D
spatial reasoning to convert textual descriptions into parametric blueprints(3D
layout). And an iterative programmatic validation mechanism iteratively refines
layout parameters through LLM-mediated dialogue loops; (2) Furniture
Generation. SceneLCM employs Consistency Trajectory Sampling(CTS), a
consistency distillation sampling loss guided by LCM, to form fast,
semantically rich, and high-quality representations. We also offer two
theoretical justification to demonstrate that our CTS loss is equivalent to
consistency loss and its distillation error is bounded by the truncation error
of the Euler solver; (3) Environment Optimization. We use a multiresolution
texture field to encode the appearance of the scene, and optimize via CTS loss.
To maintain cross-geometric texture coherence, we introduce a normal-aware
cross-attention decoder to predict RGB by cross-attending to the anchors
locations in geometrically heterogeneous instance. (4)Physically Editing.
SceneLCM supports physically editing by integrating physical simulation,
achieved persistent physical realism. Extensive experiments validate SceneLCM's
superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, showing its wide-ranging
potential for diverse applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业面板监控中的文本检测任务面临跨尺度定位和密集文本区域的模糊边界等挑战，现有方法多关注单一文本形状，缺乏对多尺度特征的全面探索。

Method: 提出了一种基于Transformer的高效混合器，学习多级特征间的相互依赖关系，并结合新的Catmull-Rom样条特征采样方法，显式编码文本的形状、位置和语义信息。

Conclusion: EdgeSpotter在复杂工业面板监控任务中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，代码和演示已开源。

Abstract: Text spotting for industrial panels is a key task for intelligent monitoring.
However, achieving efficient and accurate text spotting for complex industrial
panels remains challenging due to issues such as cross-scale localization and
ambiguous boundaries in dense text regions. Moreover, most existing methods
primarily focus on representing a single text shape, neglecting a comprehensive
exploration of multi-scale feature information across different texts. To
address these issues, this work proposes a novel multi-scale dense text spotter
for edge AI-based vision system (EdgeSpotter) to achieve accurate and robust
industrial panel monitoring. Specifically, a novel Transformer with efficient
mixer is developed to learn the interdependencies among multi-level features,
integrating multi-layer spatial and semantic cues. In addition, a new feature
sampling with catmull-rom splines is designed, which explicitly encodes the
shape, position, and semantic information of text, thereby alleviating missed
detections and reducing recognition errors caused by multi-scale or dense text
regions. Furthermore, a new benchmark dataset for industrial panel monitoring
(IPM) is constructed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
this challenging benchmark dataset validate the superior performance of the
proposed method in different challenging panel monitoring tasks. Finally,
practical tests based on the self-designed edge AI-based vision system
demonstrate the practicality of the method. The code and demo will be available
at https://github.com/vision4robotics/EdgeSpotter.

TL;DR: Hi-VAE是一种高效的视频自动编码框架，通过分层编码视频动态的粗到细运动表示，显著减少冗余，实现高压缩率和高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频自动编码方法未能高效建模动态中的时空冗余，导致压缩率低且训练成本高。

Method: Hi-VAE将视频动态分解为全局运动和详细运动两个潜在空间，使用自监督运动编码器压缩视频潜在表示，并通过条件扩散解码器重建视频。

Result: Hi-VAE实现了1428倍的高压缩率，比基线方法高30倍，同时保持高质量重建和下游生成任务的有效性。

Conclusion: Hi-VAE在高效压缩和高质量重建方面表现出色，为视频潜在表示和生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video autoencoders (Video AEs) have advanced video
generation, but existing methods fail to efficiently model spatio-temporal
redundancies in dynamics, resulting in suboptimal compression factors. This
shortfall leads to excessive training costs for downstream tasks. To address
this, we introduce Hi-VAE, an efficient video autoencoding framework that
hierarchically encode coarse-to-fine motion representations of video dynamics
and formulate the decoding process as a conditional generation task.
Specifically, Hi-VAE decomposes video dynamics into two latent spaces: Global
Motion, capturing overarching motion patterns, and Detailed Motion, encoding
high-frequency spatial details. Using separate self-supervised motion encoders,
we compress video latents into compact motion representations to reduce
redundancy significantly. A conditional diffusion decoder then reconstructs
videos by combining hierarchical global and detailed motions, enabling
high-fidelity video reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Hi-VAE achieves a high compression factor of 1428$\times$, almost 30$\times$
higher than baseline methods (e.g., Cosmos-VAE at 48$\times$), validating the
efficiency of our approach. Meanwhile, Hi-VAE maintains high reconstruction
quality at such high compression rates and performs effectively in downstream
generative tasks. Moreover, Hi-VAE exhibits interpretability and scalability,
providing new perspectives for future exploration in video latent
representation and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）因计算成本高和视觉令牌序列的二次复杂度而面临挑战，需要优化令牌处理以提高效率。

Method: 提出STF方法融合空间相邻令牌以减少序列长度，并引入MBTF模块补充多粒度特征。

Conclusion: STF和MBTF模块的结合有效平衡了令牌减少和信息保留，提升了推理效率且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer significant computational challenges
due to the high cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the quadratic
complexity of processing long vision token sequences. In this paper, we explore
the spatial redundancy among vision tokens and shorten the length of vision
token sequences for inference acceleration. Specifically, we propose a Spatial
Token Fusion (STF) method to learn compact vision tokens for short vision token
sequence, where spatial-adjacent tokens are fused into one. Meanwhile,
weight-frozen vision encoder can not well adapt to the demand of extensive
downstream vision-language tasks. To this end, we further introduce a
Multi-Block Token Fusion (MBTF) module to supplement multi-granularity features
for the reduced token sequence. Overall, we combine STF and MBTF module to
balance token reduction and information preservation, thereby improving
inference efficiency without sacrificing multimodal reasoning capabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on LLaVA-1.5 achieves
comparable or even superior performance to the baseline on 8 popular
vision-language benchmarks with only $25\%$ vision tokens of baseline. The
source code and trained weights are available at

TL;DR: GoTrack是一种基于CAD的高效6DoF物体姿态优化与跟踪方法，无需对象特定训练，结合模型到帧和帧到帧的配准，通过光流估计实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪方法仅依赖模型到帧配准，计算量大且稳定性不足，GoTrack通过结合帧到帧配准优化性能。

Method: 使用标准神经网络模块（基于DINOv2的Transformer）实现模型到帧配准，轻量级光流模型处理帧到帧配准。

Result: GoTrack与现有粗姿态估计方法结合，在标准6DoF姿态估计与跟踪基准上达到RGB-only的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GoTrack提供了一种高效、稳定的6DoF物体姿态跟踪方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We introduce GoTrack, an efficient and accurate CAD-based method for 6DoF
object pose refinement and tracking, which can handle diverse objects without
any object-specific training. Unlike existing tracking methods that rely solely
on an analysis-by-synthesis approach for model-to-frame registration, GoTrack
additionally integrates frame-to-frame registration, which saves compute and
stabilizes tracking. Both types of registration are realized by optical flow
estimation. The model-to-frame registration is noticeably simpler than in
existing methods, relying only on standard neural network blocks (a transformer
is trained on top of DINOv2) and producing reliable pose confidence scores
without a scoring network. For the frame-to-frame registration, which is an
easier problem as consecutive video frames are typically nearly identical, we
employ a light off-the-shelf optical flow model. We demonstrate that GoTrack
can be seamlessly combined with existing coarse pose estimation methods to
create a minimal pipeline that reaches state-of-the-art RGB-only results on
standard benchmarks for 6DoF object pose estimation and tracking. Our source
code and trained models are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种方法加速低端嵌入式GPU上的Oriented FAST特征检测，显著提升SLAM系统实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORB-based SLAM系统在移动平台上实时处理需求未满足，主要因Oriented FAST计算耗时。

Method: 优化FAST特征点检测和Harris角点检测，采用二进制编码策略和可分离Harris检测策略。

Result: 在Jetson TX2上实验显示，速度比OpenCV GPU支持快7.3倍。

Conclusion: 方法有效，适用于移动和资源受限环境中的实时应用。

Abstract: The visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technology
widely used in applications such as robotic navigation and virtual reality,
which primarily focuses on detecting feature points from visual images to
construct an unknown environmental map and simultaneously determines its own
location. It usually imposes stringent requirements on hardware power
consumption, processing speed and accuracy. Currently, the ORB (Oriented FAST
and Rotated BRIEF)-based SLAM systems have exhibited superior performance in
terms of processing speed and robustness. However, they still fall short of
meeting the demands for real-time processing on mobile platforms. This
limitation is primarily due to the time-consuming Oriented FAST calculations
accounting for approximately half of the entire SLAM system. This paper
presents two methods to accelerate the Oriented FAST feature detection on
low-end embedded GPUs. These methods optimize the most time-consuming steps in
Oriented FAST feature detection: FAST feature point detection and Harris corner
detection, which is achieved by implementing a binary-level encoding strategy
to determine candidate points quickly and a separable Harris detection strategy
with efficient low-level GPU hardware-specific instructions. Extensive
experiments on a Jetson TX2 embedded GPU demonstrate an average speedup of over
7.3 times compared to widely used OpenCV with GPU support. This significant
improvement highlights its effectiveness and potential for real-time
applications in mobile and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Frame Guidance是一种高效、无需训练的可控视频生成方法，适用于多种任务和输入信号。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved video quality,
directing attention to fine-grained controllability. However, many existing
methods depend on fine-tuning large-scale video models for specific tasks,
which becomes increasingly impractical as model sizes continue to grow. In this
work, we present Frame Guidance, a training-free guidance for controllable
video generation based on frame-level signals, such as keyframes, style
reference images, sketches, or depth maps. For practical training-free
guidance, we propose a simple latent processing method that dramatically
reduces memory usage, and apply a novel latent optimization strategy designed
for globally coherent video generation. Frame Guidance enables effective
control across diverse tasks, including keyframe guidance, stylization, and
looping, without any training, compatible with any video models. Experimental
results show that Frame Guidance can produce high-quality controlled videos for
a wide range of tasks and input signals.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a dominant paradigm, yet its
highly entangled black-box models pose significant challenges in terms of
interpretability and safety assurance. To improve model transparency and
training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled
post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By
reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate
supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent
training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling
of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights
into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed
optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear
equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient
training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature
backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to
traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.

### [209] [SAP-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Surgical Action Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07196)
*Mengya Xu,Zhongzhen Huang,Dillan Imans,Yiru Ye,Xiaofan Zhang,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAP-Bench是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在手术动作规划任务中表现的大规模高质量数据集，填补了当前基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术动作规划任务需要精确的分析能力，而现有基准测试无法充分评估模型在生命关键领域的表现。

Method: 通过SAP-Bench数据集（包含1,226个临床验证的动作片段）和MLLM-SAP框架，利用MLLM生成下一步动作建议。

Result: 评估了七种先进MLLM，揭示了在下一步动作预测性能上的关键差距。

Conclusion: SAP-Bench为手术动作规划任务提供了有效的评估工具，并展示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Effective evaluation is critical for driving advancements in MLLM research.
The surgical action planning (SAP) task, which aims to generate future action
sequences from visual inputs, demands precise and sophisticated analytical
capabilities. Unlike mathematical reasoning, surgical decision-making operates
in life-critical domains and requires meticulous, verifiable processes to
ensure reliability and patient safety. This task demands the ability to
distinguish between atomic visual actions and coordinate complex, long-horizon
procedures, capabilities that are inadequately evaluated by current benchmarks.
To address this gap, we introduce SAP-Bench, a large-scale, high-quality
dataset designed to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform
interpretable surgical action planning. Our SAP-Bench benchmark, derived from
the cholecystectomy procedures context with the mean duration of 1137.5s, and
introduces temporally-grounded surgical action annotations, comprising the
1,226 clinically validated action clips (mean duration: 68.7s) capturing five
fundamental surgical actions across 74 procedures. The dataset provides 1,152
strategically sampled current frames, each paired with the corresponding next
action as multimodal analysis anchors. We propose the MLLM-SAP framework that
leverages MLLMs to generate next action recommendations from the current
surgical scene and natural language instructions, enhanced with injected
surgical domain knowledge. To assess our dataset's effectiveness and the
broader capabilities of current models, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
MLLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, GPT-4o, QwenVL2.5-72B, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GeminiPro2.5,
Step-1o, and GLM-4v) and reveal critical gaps in next action prediction
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-LiVE是一种无需训练、基于文本指导的视频编辑框架，通过利用关键层的活力信息，实现对象添加和非刚性视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法主要关注风格转换、背景替换等任务，复杂任务如对象添加和非刚性变换研究较少，TV-LiVE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过识别视频生成模型中的关键层（与RoPE相关），选择性注入源模型的特征到目标模型，并提取掩码区域以实现对象添加。

Result: 实验表明，TV-LiVE在对象添加和非刚性视频编辑任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TV-LiVE为复杂视频编辑任务提供了一种高效、可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Video editing has garnered increasing attention alongside the rapid progress
of diffusion-based video generation models. As part of these advancements,
there is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video
editing, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused
on tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,
and attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the
source video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel
objects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this
paper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing
framework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify
vital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the
quality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method
enables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively
injecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding
layers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,
we further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding
to the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the
prominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental
results demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both
object addition and non-rigid video editing. Project Page:

*Zhiyuan Zhong,Zhen Sun,Yepang Liu,Xinlei He,Guanhong Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的后门攻击方法BadSem，利用跨模态语义不匹配作为隐式触发器，攻击视觉语言模型（VLMs）。该方法通过数据投毒在训练时故意错配图像-文本对，实验表明攻击成功率高达98%，且防御策略难以缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击主要依赖单模态触发器，未能充分利用VLMs的跨模态融合特性。论文旨在探索跨模态语义不匹配作为攻击面的潜力。

Method: 提出BadSem攻击方法，通过构建SIMBad数据集（涉及颜色和对象属性）在训练时故意错配图像-文本对，实现隐式后门注入。

Result: 在四种广泛使用的VLMs上，BadSem平均攻击成功率（ASR）超过98%，且能泛化到分布外数据集和跨模态传输。防御策略（系统提示和监督微调）均未奏效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在语义层面的安全漏洞，亟需更有效的防御机制以确保其安全部署。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance, but are also
vulnerable to backdoor attacks whereby the adversary can manipulate the model's
outputs through hidden triggers. Prior attacks primarily rely on
single-modality triggers, leaving the crucial cross-modal fusion nature of VLMs
largely unexplored. Unlike prior work, we identify a novel attack surface that
leverages cross-modal semantic mismatches as implicit triggers. Based on this
insight, we propose BadSem (Backdoor Attack with Semantic Manipulation), a data
poisoning attack that injects stealthy backdoors by deliberately misaligning
image-text pairs during training. To perform the attack, we construct SIMBad, a
dataset tailored for semantic manipulation involving color and object
attributes. Extensive experiments across four widely used VLMs show that BadSem
achieves over 98% average ASR, generalizes well to out-of-distribution
datasets, and can transfer across poisoning modalities. Our detailed analysis
using attention visualization shows that backdoored models focus on
semantically sensitive regions under mismatched conditions while maintaining
normal behavior on clean inputs. To mitigate the attack, we try two defense
strategies based on system prompt and supervised fine-tuning but find that both
of them fail to mitigate the semantic backdoor. Our findings highlight the
urgent need to address semantic vulnerabilities in VLMs for their safer
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决骨架数据集中数据多样性不足的问题，模拟真实世界的变化，提升模型泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 集成几何变换、随机裁剪、旋转、缩放和强度变换（如亮度和对比度调整），生成每个样本的三个增强版本，从而扩增数据集规模。

Result: 在DHG14/28、SHREC'17和JHMDB等基准数据集上，显著提升了多流e2eET、FPPR点云手势识别和DD-Net等模型的性能，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该数据增强框架不仅提升了模型性能，还为实际应用中的手势识别和动作识别提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a crucial technique in deep learning, particularly for
tasks with limited dataset diversity, such as skeleton-based datasets. This
paper proposes a comprehensive data augmentation framework that integrates
geometric transformations, random cropping, rotation, zooming and
intensity-based transformations, brightness and contrast adjustments to
simulate real-world variations. Random cropping ensures the preservation of
spatio-temporal integrity while addressing challenges such as viewpoint bias
and occlusions. The augmentation pipeline generates three augmented versions
for each sample in addition to the data set sample, thus quadrupling the data
set size and enriching the diversity of gesture representations. The proposed
augmentation strategy is evaluated on three models: multi-stream e2eET, FPPR
point cloud-based hand gesture recognition (HGR), and DD-Network. Experiments
are conducted on benchmark datasets including DHG14/28, SHREC'17, and JHMDB.
The e2eET model, recognized as the state-of-the-art for hand gesture
recognition on DHG14/28 and SHREC'17. The FPPR-PCD model, the second-best
performing model on SHREC'17, excels in point cloud-based gesture recognition.
DD-Net, a lightweight and efficient architecture for skeleton-based action
recognition, is evaluated on SHREC'17 and the Human Motion Data Base (JHMDB).
The results underline the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed
augmentation strategy, significantly improving model generalization and
robustness across diverse datasets and architectures. This framework not only
establishes state-of-the-art results on all three evaluated models but also
offers a scalable solution to advance HGR and action recognition applications
in real-world scenarios. The framework is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但在细粒度视觉差异上仍存在幻觉或语义遗漏问题，主要源于训练数据和目标函数的局限性。

Method: 提出可控数据生成流程构建MED数据集（50K图像-文本对），并设计监督微调框架，结合特征级一致性损失优化模型。

Result: 在Micro Edit Detection基准测试中，方法显著提升了差异检测准确率并减少幻觉，同时在标准视觉语言任务（如图像描述和视觉问答）中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 通过针对性数据和目标对齐，有效增强了MLLMs的细粒度视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks but still struggle with fine-grained visual differences,
leading to hallucinations or missed semantic shifts. We attribute this to
limitations in both training data and learning objectives. To address these
issues, we propose a controlled data generation pipeline that produces
minimally edited image pairs with semantically aligned captions. Using this
pipeline, we construct the Micro Edit Dataset (MED), containing over 50K
image-text pairs spanning 11 fine-grained edit categories, including attribute,
count, position, and object presence changes. Building on MED, we introduce a
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework with a feature-level consistency loss
that promotes stable visual embeddings under small edits. We evaluate our
approach on the Micro Edit Detection benchmark, which includes carefully
balanced evaluation pairs designed to test sensitivity to subtle visual
variations across the same edit categories. Our method improves difference
detection accuracy and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines,
including GPT-4o. Moreover, it yields consistent gains on standard
vision-language tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining targeted data and
alignment objectives for enhancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs采用静态推理范式，无法动态调整视觉理解，限制了其适应性和迭代优化能力，而人类感知是动态且反馈驱动的。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，引入推理器和验证器，通过多步直接偏好优化（DPO）训练验证器，并构建了VTS数据集支持训练。

Result: 该方法在多种视觉推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，提高了准确性并提供了更可解释的推理过程。

Conclusion: 动态推理机制为下一代MLLMs实现细粒度、上下文感知的视觉推理提供了潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
capabilities by integrating visual perception with language understanding,
enabling applications such as image-grounded dialogue, visual question
answering, and scientific analysis. However, most MLLMs adopt a static
inference paradigm, encoding the entire image into fixed visual tokens upfront,
which limits their ability to iteratively refine understanding or adapt to
context during inference. This contrasts sharply with human perception, which
is dynamic, selective, and feedback-driven. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework for inference-time visual token scaling that enables MLLMs to perform
iterative, verifier-guided reasoning over visual content. We formulate the
problem as a Markov Decision Process, involving a reasoner that proposes visual
actions and a verifier, which is trained via multi-step Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), that evaluates these actions and determines when reasoning
should terminate. To support this, we present a new dataset, VTS, comprising
supervised reasoning trajectories (VTS-SFT) and preference-labeled reasoning
comparisons (VTS-DPO). Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches
across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks, offering not only improved accuracy
but also more interpretable and grounded reasoning processes. These results
demonstrate the promise of dynamic inference mechanisms for enabling
fine-grained, context-aware visual reasoning in next-generation MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 VDMs 在视频生成之外的潜力，尤其是其内部结构和视觉世界理解能力。

Method: 提出一个少样本微调框架，将任务转化为视觉过渡，训练 LoRA 权重而不改变冻结的 VDM 生成接口。

Result: 模型在低层视觉（如分割、姿态估计）到高层推理（如 ARC-AGI）任务中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VDMs 是适应性强的视觉学习器，有望成为未来视觉基础模型的核心。

Abstract: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools,
capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their
potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training
dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally
pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit
understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal
knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs
for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task
into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short
input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen
VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization
across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose
estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results
reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual
learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation
models in vision.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在去噪步骤中采用多步优化的策略，显著提升了图像质量、感知准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如MPGD）在去噪步骤中仅应用单次梯度更新，限制了恢复的保真度和鲁棒性，尤其是在嵌入式或分布外场景中。

Method: 在每次去噪时间步中引入多步优化策略，增加梯度更新次数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务中提升了LPIPS和PSNR指标，且延迟开销极小。MPGD在自然和航空场景中也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MPGD作为一种轻量级、即插即用的恢复模块，在实时视觉感知（如无人机和移动机器人）中具有潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable flexibility for solving inverse
problems without task-specific retraining. However, existing approaches such as
Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update
per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in
embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a
multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly
enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our
experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that
increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with
minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin
Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally
trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes.
Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play
restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such
as drones and mobile robots.

Motivation: 现实监控中低分辨率帧难以识别人脸和车牌，需要开发能利用时序信息的模型。

Method: 数据集包含1,463个LR视频片段，定义人脸匹配和车牌识别任务，并引入评估指标。

Result: 基线方法在两项任务中分别达到0.58和0.42的分数，显示任务的可行性和挑战性。

Conclusion: FANVID旨在推动LR识别中的时序建模创新，支持监控、法医和自动驾驶等应用。

Abstract: Real-world surveillance often renders faces and license plates unrecognizable
in individual low-resolution (LR) frames, hindering reliable identification. To
advance temporal recognition models, we present FANVID, a novel video-based
benchmark comprising nearly 1,463 LR clips (180 x 320, 20--60 FPS) featuring 63
identities and 49 license plates from three English-speaking countries. Each
video includes distractor faces and plates, increasing task difficulty and
realism. The dataset contains 31,096 manually verified bounding boxes and
labels.
  FANVID defines two tasks: (1) face matching -- detecting LR faces and
matching them to high-resolution mugshots, and (2) license plate recognition --
extracting text from LR plates without a predefined database. Videos are
downsampled from high-resolution sources to ensure that faces and text are
indecipherable in single frames, requiring models to exploit temporal
information. We introduce evaluation metrics adapted from mean Average
Precision at IoU > 0.5, prioritizing identity correctness for faces and
character-level accuracy for text.
  A baseline method with pre-trained video super-resolution, detection, and
recognition achieved performance scores of 0.58 (face matching) and 0.42 (plate
recognition), highlighting both the feasibility and challenge of the tasks.
FANVID's selection of faces and plates balances diversity with recognition
challenge. We release the software for data access, evaluation, baseline, and
annotation to support reproducibility and extension. FANVID aims to catalyze
innovation in temporal modeling for LR recognition, with applications in
surveillance, forensics, and autonomous vehicles.

Motivation: 现有点跟踪方法无法提供高分辨率和密集的对应关系，而现有光流方法仅能对应到下一帧。AllTracker旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合光流和点跟踪技术，通过低分辨率网格的迭代推断、空间信息传播（2D卷积层）和时间信息传播（像素对齐注意力层）实现。

Result: 模型快速且参数高效（1600万参数），在高分辨率（768x1024像素）下实现最先进的点跟踪精度。

Conclusion: AllTracker的设计使其能在更广泛的数据集上训练，且训练对性能至关重要。代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by
way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of
a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers
high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be
visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach
corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the
next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques
from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs
iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates,
propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating
information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast
and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art
point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on
a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train on a wider set of
datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide
an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe,
making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性方法在可视化模型预测时被广泛使用，但其视觉合理性可能掩盖了关键局限性，尤其是对类别标签的区分能力不足。

Method: 提出诊断测试评估显著性方法的类别敏感性，并通过实验验证现有方法的局限性；随后引入CASE方法，通过对比性解释隔离预测类别的独特特征。

Result: 实验表明许多显著性方法对类别不敏感，而CASE方法在诊断测试和保真度测试中表现更优，提供更忠实且类别特定的解释。

Conclusion: 显著性方法的类别不敏感性是普遍问题，CASE方法通过对比性解释解决了这一问题，提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed
relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can
obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for
class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class
labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many
widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless
of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that
class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets,
suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated
by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that
isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate
CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and
show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖随机采样视点或轨迹，导致渲染和比较开销大，缺乏优化的视点选择。

Method: 结合跨层级语义评分（CLIP相关场）和局部几何评分，估计最佳匹配视点。

Result: 在模拟和实际场景中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 分层评分范式显著提升了导航效率和准确性。

Abstract: Instance Image-Goal Navigation (IIN) requires autonomous agents to identify
and navigate to a target object or location depicted in a reference image
captured from any viewpoint. While recent methods leverage powerful novel view
synthesis (NVS) techniques, such as three-dimensional Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), they typically rely on randomly sampling multiple viewpoints or
trajectories to ensure comprehensive coverage of discriminative visual cues.
This approach, however, creates significant redundancy through overlapping
image samples and lacks principled view selection, substantially increasing
both rendering and comparison overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel IIN
framework with a hierarchical scoring paradigm that estimates optimal
viewpoints for target matching. Our approach integrates cross-level semantic
scoring, utilizing CLIP-derived relevancy fields to identify regions with high
semantic similarity to the target object class, with fine-grained local
geometric scoring that performs precise pose estimation within promising
regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on simulated IIN benchmarks and real-world
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如YOLO）在农业植物检测中因遮挡、不规则结构和背景噪声导致精度下降，而传统STN的仿射变换无法处理非刚性变形（如弯曲叶片和重叠）。

Method: 模型整合了TPS以实现非刚性空间变换，并引入CBAM模块抑制背景噪声，突出相关特征。

Result: 在PGP数据集上，模型在精度、召回率和mAP上优于STN-YOLO，误报率降低12%。

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型提升了空间感知能力，适合实时边缘部署，适用于智能农业的高效监测。

Abstract: Object detection is vital in precision agriculture for plant monitoring,
disease detection, and yield estimation. However, models like YOLO struggle
with occlusions, irregular structures, and background noise, reducing detection
accuracy. While Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) improve spatial invariance
through learned transformations, affine mappings are insufficient for non-rigid
deformations such as bent leaves and overlaps.
  We propose CBAM-STN-TPS-YOLO, a model integrating Thin-Plate Splines (TPS)
into STNs for flexible, non-rigid spatial transformations that better align
features. Performance is further enhanced by the Convolutional Block Attention
Module (CBAM), which suppresses background noise and emphasizes relevant
spatial and channel-wise features.
  On the occlusion-heavy Plant Growth and Phenotyping (PGP) dataset, our model
outperforms STN-YOLO in precision, recall, and mAP. It achieves a 12% reduction
in false positives, highlighting the benefits of improved spatial flexibility
and attention-guided refinement. We also examine the impact of the TPS
regularization parameter in balancing transformation smoothness and detection
performance.
  This lightweight model improves spatial awareness and supports real-time edge
deployment, making it ideal for smart farming applications requiring accurate
and efficient monitoring.

Abstract: Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable
progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on
the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the
unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct
the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the
objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence,
compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional
object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations.
In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each
object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for
complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised
representation performance on both single object centric images and
multi-object ones. The source code is available at

Result: 在两个公开数据集上验证，性能优于现有方法，95HD和ASD指标提升至少6%。

Conclusion: C3S3模型显著提升了医学图像分割的边界精确度和整体性能。

Abstract: For the immanent challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in the medical
field, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) offers a promising
solution. Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target
areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle
details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic
inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised
segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition
and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary
delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an
$\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining
boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic
Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing
sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation
quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly
accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to
previous cutting-edge competitors. Especially, on the 95HD and ASD metrics, our
approach achieves a notable improvement of at least $6\%$, highlighting the
significant advancements. The code is available at

Conclusion: GFVC具有广阔应用前景，但仍需解决当前挑战以加速标准化和实际部署。

Abstract: The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,
reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability
for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video
Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could
characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream
compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models
to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at
the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable
high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far
surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of
GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,
systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and
industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of
existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization
strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we
construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective
Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the
most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the
GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a
low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future
practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of
GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and
future opportunities.

Motivation: 现有VideoLLM在自由文本生成任务（如视频字幕）中幻觉问题严重，而传统基准测试仅依赖选择题，无法全面评估性能。

Method: 提出ARGUS基准，通过对比模型生成字幕与人工标注的真实字幕，量化幻觉（错误内容或时间关系）和遗漏（重要细节缺失）率。

Result: ARGUS提供了全面的视频字幕性能评估，量化了模型的幻觉和遗漏问题。

Conclusion: ARGUS为VideoLLM的自由文本生成任务提供了更全面的评估工具，有助于改进模型性能。

Abstract: Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to
their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on
multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more
aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they
do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose
ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning
performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions,
ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in
the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships.
Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive
details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video
captioning performance.

Motivation: 现有协作感知研究主要针对车辆类别，缺乏对多类别对象的有效解决方案，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了全局空间注意力融合模块（GSAF）提升多尺度特征学习，引入视觉语义重识别模块（REID）减少ID切换错误，并开发了速度自适应的轨迹管理模块（VATM）。

Result: 在V2X-Real和OPV2V数据集上，方法显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了多类别协作检测与跟踪问题，提升了实际场景的适用性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception plays a crucial role in enhancing environmental
understanding by expanding the perceptual range and improving robustness
against sensor failures, which primarily involves collaborative 3D detection
and tracking tasks. The former focuses on object recognition in individual
frames, while the latter captures continuous instance tracklets over time.
However, existing works in both areas predominantly focus on the vehicle
superclass, lacking effective solutions for both multi-class collaborative
detection and tracking. This limitation hinders their applicability in
real-world scenarios, which involve diverse object classes with varying
appearances and motion patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
multi-class collaborative detection and tracking framework tailored for diverse
road users. We first present a detector with a global spatial attention fusion
(GSAF) module, enhancing multi-scale feature learning for objects of varying
sizes. Next, we introduce a tracklet RE-IDentification (REID) module that
leverages visual semantics with a vision foundation model to effectively reduce
ID SWitch (IDSW) errors, in cases of erroneous mismatches involving small
objects like pedestrians. We further design a velocity-based adaptive tracklet
management (VATM) module that adjusts the tracking interval dynamically based
on object motion. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real and OPV2V datasets show
that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in both detection and tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决跨域少样本分割中的域差距和数据稀缺问题，探索适配器在域信息解耦中的作用。

Method: 提出Domain Feature Navigator（DFN）作为结构化解耦器，结合SAM-SVN方法防止过拟合，并在目标域上微调DFN。

Result: 在1-shot和5-shot场景下，分别超越现有最佳方法2.69%和4.68%的MIoU。

Conclusion: DFN和SAM-SVN方法有效解决了跨域少样本分割的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to pre-train the
model on a source-domain dataset with sufficient samples, and then transfer the
model to target-domain datasets where only a few samples are available for
efficient fine-tuning. There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the
domain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we
revisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not
explored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of
downstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.
Then, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's
inherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.
Building upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),
which is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current
works, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's
attention towards domain-agnostic knowledge. Moreover, to prevent the potential
excessive overfitting of DFN during the source-domain training, we further
design the SAM-SVN method to constrain DFN from learning sample-specific
knowledge. On target domains, we freeze the model and fine-tune the DFN to
learn target-specific knowledge specific. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method in CD-FSS significantly
by 2.69% and 4.68% MIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively.

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证了MrM的有效性，攻击性能稳定且对防御策略鲁棒。

Conclusion: MrM填补了视觉模态成员推理攻击的空白，为多模态RAG系统的隐私保护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large
vision-language models by integrating cross-modal knowledge, enabling their
increasing adoption across real-world multimodal tasks. These knowledge
databases may contain sensitive information that requires privacy protection.
However, multimodal RAG systems inherently grant external users indirect access
to such data, making them potentially vulnerable to privacy attacks,
particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs). % Existing MIA methods
targeting RAG systems predominantly focus on the textual modality, while the
visual modality remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
propose MrM, the first black-box MIA framework targeted at multimodal RAG
systems. It utilizes a multi-object data perturbation framework constrained by
counterfactual attacks, which can concurrently induce the RAG systems to
retrieve the target data and generate information that leaks the membership
information. Our method first employs an object-aware data perturbation method
to constrain the perturbation to key semantics and ensure successful retrieval.
Building on this, we design a counterfact-informed mask selection strategy to
prioritize the most informative masked regions, aiming to eliminate the
interference of model self-knowledge and amplify attack efficacy. Finally, we
perform statistical membership inference by modeling query trials to extract
features that reflect the reconstruction of masked semantics from response
patterns. Experiments on two visual datasets and eight mainstream commercial
visual-language models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2) demonstrate that MrM achieves
consistently strong performance across both sample-level and set-level
evaluations, and remains robust under adaptive defenses.

Conclusion: 本文为CFQA研究提供了基础资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large models in resource-constrained
environments has underscored the need for efficient transmission of
intermediate feature representations. In this context, feature coding, which
compresses features into compact bitstreams, becomes a critical component for
scenarios involving feature transmission, storage, and reuse. However, this
compression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is
notoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,
this paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality
Assessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed
features. To advance CFQA research, we propose the first benchmark dataset,
comprising 300 original features and 12000 compressed features derived from
three vision tasks and four feature codecs. Task-specific performance drops are
provided as true semantic distortion for the evaluation of CFQA metrics. We
assess the performance of three widely used metrics (MSE, cosine similarity,
and Centered Kernel Alignment) in capturing semantic degradation. The results
underscore the representativeness of the dataset and highlight the need for
more refined metrics capable of addressing the nuances of semantic distortion
in compressed features. To facilitate the ongoing development of CFQA research,
we release the dataset and all accompanying source code at
\href{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}{https://github.com/chansongoal/Compressed-Feature-Quality-Assessment}.
This contribution aims to advance the field and provide a foundational resource

Conclusion: DPFormer有效解决了持续学习中的关键问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In continual learning, solving the catastrophic forgetting problem may make
the models fall into the stability-plasticity dilemma. Moreover, inter-task
confusion will also occur due to the lack of knowledge exchanges between
different tasks. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a
novel dynamic prompt transformer (DPFormer) with prompt schemes. The prompt
schemes help the DPFormer memorize learned knowledge of previous classes and
tasks, and keep on learning new knowledge from new classes and tasks under a
single network structure with a nearly fixed number of model parameters.
Moreover, they also provide discrepant information to represent different tasks
to solve the inter-task confusion problem. Based on prompt schemes, a unified
classification module with the binary cross entropy loss, the knowledge
distillation loss and the auxiliary loss is proposed to train the whole model
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our
method achieves the best performance in the CIFAR-100, ImageNet100 and
ImageNet1K datasets under different class-incremental settings in continual
learning. The source code will be available at our GitHub after acceptance.

Conclusion: 该模型通过特征感知和Mamba增强，显著提升了超声图像分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise
biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces
significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models
are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt
to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly
evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.
Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image
segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address
these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent
viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were
designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve
the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized
residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and
enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information
and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different
optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental
validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best
segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.

Abstract: The recent emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) has
introduced new opportunities for improving visual hazard recognition on
construction sites. Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on
domain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and
describe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,
despite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited
investigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks
within the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a
comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,
GPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify
potential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested
under three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought
(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated
basic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided
step-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative
analysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all
conditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced
performance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across
models. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with
GPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also
demonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and
consistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study
offers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs
for practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more
reliable AI-assisted safety systems.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in motion capture and generative artificial
intelligence, leveraging large-scale MoCap datasets to train generative models
for synthesizing diverse, realistic human motions has become a promising
research direction. However, existing motion-capture techniques and generative
models often neglect physical constraints, leading to artifacts such as
interpenetration, sliding, and floating. These issues are exacerbated in
multi-person motion generation, where complex interactions are involved. To
address these limitations, we introduce physical mapping, integrated throughout
the human interaction generation pipeline. Specifically, motion imitation
within a physics-based simulation environment is used to project target motions
into a physically valid space. The resulting motions are adjusted to adhere to
real-world physics constraints while retaining their original semantic meaning.
This mapping not only improves MoCap data quality but also directly informs
post-processing of generated motions. Given the unique interactivity of
multi-person scenarios, we propose a tailored motion representation framework.
Motion Consistency (MC) and Marker-based Interaction (MI) loss functions are
introduced to improve model performance. Experiments show our method achieves
impressive results in generated human motion quality, with a 3%-89% improvement
in physical fidelity. Project page http://yw0208.github.io/physiinter

Conclusion: GLOS框架通过gloss级条件和TAC模块显著提升了手语生成的质量。

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG), or text-to-sign generation, bridges the gap
between signers and non-signers. Despite recent progress in SLG, existing
methods still often suffer from incorrect lexical ordering and low semantic
accuracy. This is primarily due to sentence-level condition, which encodes the
entire sentence of the input text into a single feature vector as a condition
for SLG. This approach fails to capture the temporal structure of sign language
and lacks the granularity of word-level semantics, often leading to disordered
sign sequences and ambiguous motions. To overcome these limitations, we propose
GLOS, a sign language generation framework with temporally aligned gloss-level
conditioning. First, we employ gloss-level conditions, which we define as
sequences of gloss embeddings temporally aligned with the motion sequence. This
enables the model to access both the temporal structure of sign language and
word-level semantics at each timestep. As a result, this allows for
fine-grained control of signs and better preservation of lexical order. Second,
we introduce a condition fusion module, temporal alignment conditioning (TAC),
to efficiently deliver the word-level semantic and temporal structure provided
by the gloss-level condition to the corresponding motion timesteps. Our method,
which is composed of gloss-level conditions and TAC, generates signs with
correct lexical order and high semantic accuracy, outperforming prior methods
on CSL-Daily and Phoenix-2014T.

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement
algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO
to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this
paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that
impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the
vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose
DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO
(Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO
reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the
advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping
and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning
the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data
augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable
difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our
comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video
reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval~(PRVR) aims to retrieve a video where a
specific segment is relevant to a given text query. Typical training processes
of PRVR assume a one-to-one relationship where each text query is relevant to
only one video. However, we point out the inherent ambiguity between text and
video content based on their conceptual scope and propose a framework that
incorporates this ambiguity into the model learning process. Specifically, we
propose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous
text-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:
uncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include
commonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates
pair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL
hierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive
learning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained
relationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the
text-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the
inherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often
contains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the
text-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to
mitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to
detect ambiguous pairs for its training. With all components combined, our
proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in PRVR.

Result: CoCoA-Mix在实验中表现优于现有方法，提升了任务适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoCoA-Mix通过混淆感知和置信感知机制，有效解决了提示调优中的挑战。

Abstract: Prompt tuning, which adapts vision-language models by freezing model
parameters and optimizing only the prompt, has proven effective for
task-specific adaptations. The core challenge in prompt tuning is improving
specialization for a specific task and generalization for unseen domains.
However, frozen encoders often produce misaligned features, leading to
confusion between classes and limiting specialization. To overcome this issue,
we propose a confusion-aware loss (CoA-loss) that improves specialization by
refining the decision boundaries between confusing classes. Additionally, we
mathematically demonstrate that a mixture model can enhance generalization
without compromising specialization. This is achieved using confidence-aware
weights (CoA-weights), which adjust the weights of each prediction in the
mixture model based on its confidence within the class domains. Extensive
experiments show that CoCoA-Mix, a mixture model with CoA-loss and CoA-weights,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing specialization and
generalization. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: DriveAnyMesh是一种基于单目视频驱动的网格动画生成方法，解决了当前4D生成技术在渲染引擎兼容性和效率上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前4D生成技术存在渲染效率低、骨骼方法需要大量手动工作且缺乏跨类别泛化能力的问题。

Method: 提出了一种4D扩散模型，通过去噪潜在集序列并解码为网格动画，结合基于变压器的变分自编码器捕获3D形状和运动信息。

Result: 实验表明，DriveAnyMesh能快速生成高质量复杂运动动画，且与现代渲染引擎兼容。

Conclusion: 该方法在游戏和电影行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose DriveAnyMesh, a method for driving mesh guided by monocular video.
Current 4D generation techniques encounter challenges with modern rendering
engines. Implicit methods have low rendering efficiency and are unfriendly to
rasterization-based engines, while skeletal methods demand significant manual
effort and lack cross-category generalization. Animating existing 3D assets,
instead of creating 4D assets from scratch, demands a deep understanding of the
input's 3D structure. To tackle these challenges, we present a 4D diffusion
model that denoises sequences of latent sets, which are then decoded to produce
mesh animations from point cloud trajectory sequences. These latent sets
leverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing
3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,
transformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple
latent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated
results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DriveAnyMesh can rapidly
produce high-quality animations for complex motions and is compatible with
modern rendering engines. This method holds potential for applications in both
the gaming and filming industries.

Abstract: SpatialLM is a large language model designed to process 3D point cloud data
and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs. These outputs include
architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes

  To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset
consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with
ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling
and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art
performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object
detection. With that, we show a feasible path for enhancing the spatial
understanding capabilities of modern LLMs for applications in augmented
reality, embodied robotics, and more.

Abstract: We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view
driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal
consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a
DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR
generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are
directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution
across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured
semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on
vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level
supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that
Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics
(FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including
segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical
utility of the generated data.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，MoQAE在效率和效果上均优于现有KV缓存量化方法。

Conclusion: MoQAE通过混合精度量化和优化路由机制，显著提升了KV缓存的效率与效果。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for
long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value
(KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated
promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization
methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this
paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via
mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization
bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts
(MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency
caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE
method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a
lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive
loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,
we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to
further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV
cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper addresses key aspects of domain randomization in generating
synthetic data for manufacturing object detection applications. To this end, we
present a comprehensive data generation pipeline that reflects different
factors: object characteristics, background, illumination, camera settings, and
post-processing. We also introduce the Synthetic Industrial Parts Object
Detection dataset (SIP15-OD) consisting of 15 objects from three industrial use
cases under varying environments as a test bed for the study, while also
employing an industrial dataset publicly available for robotic applications. In
our experiments, we present more abundant results and insights into the
feasibility as well as challenges of sim-to-real object detection. In
particular, we identified material properties, rendering methods,
post-processing, and distractors as important factors. Our method, leveraging
these, achieves top performance on the public dataset with Yolov8 models

Motivation: 解决OCT设备成本高和操作复杂的问题，通过生成模型提升医疗可及性。

Method: 挑战赛框架包括基准数据集、评估方法（图像和视频距离指标），并分析了42个初步提交和9个决赛方案。

Result: 领先方法结合了数据预处理、预训练、视觉基础模型和架构改进，342支团队参与。

Conclusion: 挑战赛首次证明了2D到3D OCT合成的可行性，有望提升资源匮乏地区的眼科医疗水平。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution, 3D, and
non-invasive visualization of retinal layers in vivo, serving as a critical
tool for lesion localization and disease diagnosis. However, its widespread
adoption is limited by equipment costs and the need for specialized operators.
In comparison, 2D color fundus photography offers faster acquisition and
greater accessibility with less dependence on expensive devices. Although
generative artificial intelligence has demonstrated promising results in
medical image synthesis, translating 2D fundus images into 3D OCT images
presents unique challenges due to inherent differences in data dimensionality
and biological information between modalities. To advance generative models in
the fundus-to-3D-OCT setting, the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society
(APTOS-2024) organized a challenge titled Artificial Intelligence-based OCT
Generation from Fundus Images. This paper details the challenge framework
(referred to as APTOS-2024 Challenge), including: the benchmark dataset,
evaluation methodology featuring two fidelity metrics-image-based distance
(pixel-level OCT B-scan similarity) and video-based distance (semantic-level
volumetric consistency), and analysis of top-performing solutions. The
challenge attracted 342 participating teams, with 42 preliminary submissions
and 9 finalists. Leading methodologies incorporated innovations in hybrid data
preprocessing or augmentation (cross-modality collaborative paradigms),
pre-training on external ophthalmic imaging datasets, integration of vision
foundation models, and model architecture improvement. The APTOS-2024 Challenge
is the first benchmark demonstrating the feasibility of fundus-to-3D-OCT
synthesis as a potential solution for improving ophthalmic care accessibility
in under-resourced healthcare settings, while helping to expedite medical
research and clinical applications.

TL;DR: SPTI是一种通过文本中介生成高分辨率差分隐私（DP）合成图像的新方法，避免了直接处理图像的复杂性，显著提升了图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP图像合成方法难以生成高分辨率且忠实于原始数据的图像，SPTI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPTI通过图像到文本模型将私有图像转换为文本描述，使用改进的Private Evolution算法生成DP文本，再通过文本到图像模型重建图像。

Result: 在LSUN Bedroom和MM CelebA HQ数据集上，SPTI的FID显著优于现有方法（如26.71 vs 40.36）。

Conclusion: SPTI提供了一种资源高效且兼容专有模型的方法，为私有视觉数据的共享和分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers
a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without
compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods
struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the
structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,
referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can
generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift
the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by
leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes
each private image into a concise textual description using image to text
models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP
text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI
requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a
private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality
than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less
than or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private
Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less
than or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine
tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private
Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model
compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,
greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有H&E-to-IHC研究常忽略细胞核与细胞膜的跨通道相关性，限制了病理图像分析与诊断的潜力。

Method: CCPL将HER2免疫组化染色分解为Hematoxylin和DAB染色通道，利用Gigapath的Tile Encoder提取双通道特征并测量跨通道相关性，同时通过特征蒸馏损失和光学密度统计确保染色一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CCPL在PSNR、SSIM、PCC和FID等定量指标及病理学家评估中表现优异，有效保留病理特征并生成高质量虚拟染色图像。

Conclusion: CCPL为多媒体医疗数据的自动化病理诊断提供了有力支持，提升了虚拟染色技术的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital pathology, virtual staining has become
a key technology in multimedia medical information systems, offering new
possibilities for the analysis and diagnosis of pathological images. However,
existing H&E-to-IHC studies often overlook the cross-channel correlations
between cell nuclei and cell membranes. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Cross-Channel Perception Learning (CCPL) strategy. Specifically, CCPL
first decomposes HER2 immunohistochemical staining into Hematoxylin and DAB
staining channels, corresponding to cell nuclei and cell membranes,
respectively. Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,
CCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and
measures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features
of the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,
are also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's
feature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.
Additionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density
maps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and
intensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,
SSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,
demonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates
high-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated
pathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.

difficulty of flexible multi-conditional generation limit previous works on
generation controllability and diversity in practice. In this paper, we build
OpenDance5D, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 101 hours across
14 distinct genres. Each sample has five modalities to facilitate robust
cross-modal learning: RGB video, audio, 2D keypoints, 3D motion, and
fine-grained textual descriptions from human arts. Furthermore, we propose
OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance
generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text prompts,

OpenDanceNet achieves high-fidelity and flexible controllability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the task of writer retrieval, which identifies
documents authored by the same individual within a dataset based on handwriting
similarities. While existing datasets and methodologies primarily focus on page
level retrieval, we explore the impact of text quantity on writer retrieval
performance by evaluating line- and word level retrieval. We examine three
state-of-the-art writer retrieval systems, including both handcrafted and deep
learning-based approaches, and analyze their performance using varying amounts
of text. Our experiments on the CVL and IAM dataset demonstrate that while
performance decreases by 20-30% when only one line of text is used as query and
gallery, retrieval accuracy remains above 90% of full-page performance when at
least four lines are included. We further show that text-dependent retrieval
can maintain strong performance in low-text scenarios. Our findings also
highlight the limitations of handcrafted features in low-text scenarios, with
deep learning-based methods like NetVLAD outperforming traditional VLAD
encoding.

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to
its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and
embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven
approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and
learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models.
Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high
computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by
coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization
to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout
generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines
synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline,
upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000
scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and
bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations.
We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor
layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our
two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then
conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II,
to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply
multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving
layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based
baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks
such as scene editing and robot navigation.

Motivation: 现有唇读方法提取的视觉特征包含说话者特定属性（如唇形、颜色、纹理），导致虚假相关性，影响准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，SIFLip在多个公开数据集上显著提升了泛化性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SIFLip通过解耦说话者特征，有效提升了唇读模型的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Lipreading is a challenging cross-modal task that aims to convert visual lip
movements into spoken text. Existing lipreading methods often extract visual
features that include speaker-specific lip attributes (e.g., shape, color,
texture), which introduce spurious correlations between vision and text. These
correlations lead to suboptimal lipreading accuracy and restrict model
generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a
speaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles
speaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules
(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve
generalization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic
consistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same
words, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as
supervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,
implicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a
speaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter
speaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these
personalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.
Experimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances
generalization performance across multiple public datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly improves generalization
performance across multiple public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods.

questions remaining: (1) how to evaluate the uncertainty of diverse LMMs in a
unified manner, (2) how to prompt LMMs to show its uncertainty, and (3) how to
quantify uncertainty for downstream tasks. In an attempt to address these
challenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed
to reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or
capabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations
to uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the
formulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying
uncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks
spanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM
uncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination
detection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的超编码网络（SEN），通过递归关联多模态编码器，增强视频理解任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型仅通过对比学习对齐不同模态的编码器，缺乏更深层次的多模态交互，难以理解复杂视频场景中的目标运动。

Method: 将预训练编码器视为“超级神经元”，设计递归关联（RA）块，逐步融合多模态信息，通过知识整合、分发和提示实现递归交互。

Result: 在跟踪、识别、聊天和编辑等四项代表性视频任务中显著提升性能，如像素级跟踪的Jaccard指数提高2.7%，文本对齐提升6.4%。

Conclusion: SEN通过递归多模态交互有效提升视频理解任务性能，为复杂场景建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video understanding has been considered as one critical step towards world
modeling, which is an important long-term problem in AI research. Recently,
multi-modal foundation models have shown such potential via large-scale
pretraining. However, these models simply align encoders of different
modalities via contrastive learning, while lacking deeper multi-modal
interactions, which is critical for understanding complex target movements with
diversified video scenes. To fill this gap, we propose a unified Super Encoding
Network (SEN) for video understanding, which builds up such distinct
interactions through recursive association of multi-modal encoders in the
foundation models. Specifically, we creatively treat those well-trained
encoders as "super neurons" in our SEN. Via designing a Recursive Association
(RA) block, we progressively fuse multi-modalities with the input video, based
on knowledge integrating, distributing, and prompting of super neurons in a
recursive manner. In this way, our SEN can effectively encode deeper
multi-modal interactions, for prompting various video understanding tasks in
downstream. Extensive experiments show that, our SEN can remarkably boost the
four most representative video tasks, including tracking, recognition,
chatting, and editing, e.g., for pixel-level tracking, the average jaccard
index improves 2.7%, temporal coherence(TC) drops 8.8% compared to the popular
CaDeX++ approach. For one-shot video editing, textual alignment improves 6.4%,
and frame consistency increases 4.1% compared to the popular TuneA-Video
approach.

TL;DR: 研究发现扩散模型API可能被滥用，通过生成合成图像训练替代模型，从而对黑盒分类模型进行高效提取和对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的高保真图像生成能力带来安全和隐私风险，如版权侵犯和敏感信息泄露，本研究揭示了一种新的安全威胁。

Method: 利用扩散模型API生成合成图像，训练替代模型，以最小查询量执行模型提取和对抗攻击。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，方法平均提升27.37%，仅用0.01倍查询预算，对抗攻击成功率达98.68%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型API可能被恶意利用，需加强安全防护措施。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and
photorealistic image generation across diverse applications. However, these
models also present security and privacy risks, including copyright violations,
sensitive information leakage, and the creation of harmful or offensive content
that could be exploited maliciously. In this study, we uncover a novel security
threat where an attacker leverages diffusion model APIs to generate synthetic
images, which are then used to train a high-performing substitute model. This
enables the attacker to execute model extraction and transfer-based adversarial
attacks on black-box classification models with minimal queries, without
needing access to the original training data. The generated images are
sufficiently high-resolution and diverse to train a substitute model whose
outputs closely match those of the target model. Across the seven benchmarks,
including CIFAR and ImageNet subsets, our method shows an average improvement
of 27.37% over state-of-the-art methods while using just 0.01 times of the
query budget, achieving a 98.68% success rate in adversarial attacks on the
target model.

TL;DR: SceneRAG是一种基于大型语言模型的视频理解框架，通过自然分割视频场景并结合多模态信息，显著提升了长视频内容的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）方法在处理长视频时因固定分段而破坏上下文连续性，无法准确捕捉场景边界。

Method: SceneRAG利用ASR转录和时间元数据分割视频为叙事一致的场景，并通过轻量级启发式和迭代校正优化边界，结合视觉和文本模态构建动态知识图谱。

Result: 在LongerVideos基准测试中，SceneRAG以72.5%的胜率显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SceneRAG通过自然场景分割和多模态融合，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for video
understanding, effectively understanding long-form video content remains
underexplored due to the vast scale and high complexity of video data. Current
RAG approaches typically segment videos into fixed-length chunks, which often
disrupts the continuity of contextual information and fails to capture
authentic scene boundaries. Inspired by the human ability to naturally organize
continuous experiences into coherent scenes, we present SceneRAG, a unified
framework that leverages large language models to segment videos into
narrative-consistent scenes by processing ASR transcripts alongside temporal
metadata. SceneRAG further sharpens these initial boundaries through
lightweight heuristics and iterative correction. For each scene, the framework
fuses information from both visual and textual modalities to extract entity
relations and dynamically builds a knowledge graph, enabling robust multi-hop
retrieval and generation that account for long-range dependencies. Experiments
on the LongerVideos benchmark, featuring over 134 hours of diverse content,
confirm that SceneRAG substantially outperforms prior baselines, achieving a
win rate of up to 72.5 percent on generation tasks.

systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a
unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset,
\textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}.
SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with
SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11
specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories
(phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis,
action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks.
Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize
across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P
yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain

Result: DragNeXt在NextBench上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DragNeXt通过区域级结构信息和渐进式指导，简化了编辑流程并提升了结果质量。

Abstract: Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by
directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention
from the community. However, it faces two key challenges:
(\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and
difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})
current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision
and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce
high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new
perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of
user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly
specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity
issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region
Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward
Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while
further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure
information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate
\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform
existing approaches. Code will be released on github.

Result: 虚拟IMU数据显著优于单独使用真实或增强数据，尤其在数据有限时。

Conclusion: 提供了选择数据生成策略的实用建议，并分析了每种方法的优缺点。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is often limited by the scarcity of labeled
datasets due to the high cost and complexity of real-world data collection. To
mitigate this, recent work has explored generating virtual inertial measurement
unit (IMU) data via cross-modality transfer. While video-based and
language-based pipelines have each shown promise, they differ in assumptions
and computational cost. Moreover, their effectiveness relative to traditional
sensor-level data augmentation remains unclear. In this paper, we present a
direct comparison between these two virtual IMU generation approaches against
classical data augmentation techniques. We construct a large-scale virtual IMU
dataset spanning 100 diverse activities from Kinetics-400 and simulate sensor
signals at 22 body locations. The three data generation strategies are
evaluated on benchmark HAR datasets (UTD-MHAD, PAMAP2, HAD-AW) using four
popular models. Results show that virtual IMU data significantly improves
performance over real or augmented data alone, particularly under limited-data
conditions. We offer practical guidance on choosing data generation strategies
and highlight the distinct advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）处理冗余视觉信息时计算效率低，难以部署在资源受限的边缘设备上。

Method: EP-VLM引入事件先验机制，通过事件数据稀疏化RGB输入，并设计位置保留的视觉编码策略。

Result: 实验显示EP-VLM在Qwen2-VL-2B上节省50%计算量，精度损失仅2%。

Conclusion: 事件视觉先验可显著提升VLM效率，为边缘设备部署高效模型提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
substantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.
However, their high computational demands hinder deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the
VLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs
contain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the
associated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a
novel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core
contribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic
event vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,
EP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB
visual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions
of the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving
tokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This
strategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while
accurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.
Experimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency
improvements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline
models from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original
Qwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the
original accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the
potential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,
paving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable
visual understanding at the edge.

Conclusion: HuSc3D填补了现有数据集的不足，为3D重建模型在真实场景中的性能评估提供了更全面的基准。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images is one of the most important tasks in
computer graphics. Unfortunately, existing datasets and benchmarks concentrate
on idealized synthetic or meticulously captured realistic data. Such benchmarks
fail to convey the inherent complexities encountered in newly acquired
real-world scenes. In such scenes especially those acquired outside, the
background is often dynamic, and by popular usage of cell phone cameras, there
might be discrepancies in, e.g., white balance. To address this gap, we present
HuSc3D, a novel dataset specifically designed for rigorous benchmarking of 3D
reconstruction models under realistic acquisition challenges. Our dataset
uniquely features six highly detailed, fully white sculptures characterized by
intricate perforations and minimal textural and color variation. Furthermore,
the number of images per scene varies significantly, introducing the additional
challenge of limited training data for some instances alongside scenes with a
standard number of views. By evaluating popular 3D reconstruction methods on
this diverse dataset, we demonstrate the distinctiveness of HuSc3D in
effectively differentiating model performance, particularly highlighting the
sensitivity of methods to fine geometric details, color ambiguity, and varying
data availability--limitations often masked by more conventional datasets.

Motivation: 传统花粉识别方法效率低且主观性强，现有深度学习模型对微小目标的定位精度不足。

Method: 提出HieraEdgeNet框架，包含三个模块：HEM（提取多尺度边缘特征）、SEF（融合边缘与语义信息）、CSPOKM（优化细节特征层）。

Result: 在120类花粉数据集上，mAP@.5达到0.9501，优于YOLOv12n和RT-DETR。

Conclusion: HieraEdgeNet通过系统整合边缘信息，为高精度、高效率的微小目标检测提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Automated pollen recognition is vital to paleoclimatology, biodiversity
monitoring, and public health, yet conventional methods are hampered by
inefficiency and subjectivity. Existing deep learning models often struggle to
achieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like
pollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and
complex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a
multi-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the
introduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),
which explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that
corresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic
Edge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic
information at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel
Module (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers
using an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel
convolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally
efficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset
comprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision
(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline
models such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms
that our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely
focused on object boundaries. By systematically integrating edge information,
HieraEdgeNet provides a robust and powerful solution for high-precision,
high-efficiency automated detection of microscopic objects.

Abstract: Reasoning over visual relationships-spatial, functional, interactional,
social, etc.-is considered to be a fundamental component of human cognition.
Yet, despite the major advances in visual comprehension in multimodal language
models (MLMs), precise reasoning over relationships and their generations
remains a challenge. We introduce ROBIN: an MLM instruction-tuned with densely
annotated relationships capable of constructing high-quality dense scene graphs
at scale. To train ROBIN, we curate SVG, a synthetic scene graph dataset by
completing the missing relations of selected objects in existing scene graphs
using a teacher MLM and a carefully designed filtering process to ensure
high-quality. To generate more accurate and rich scene graphs at scale for any
image, we introduce SG-EDIT: a self-distillation framework where GPT-4o further
refines ROBIN's predicted scene graphs by removing unlikely relations and/or
suggesting relevant ones. In total, our dataset contains 146K images and 5.6M
relationships for 2.6M objects. Results show that our ROBIN-3B model, despite
being trained on less than 3 million instances, outperforms similar-size models
trained on over 300 million instances on relationship understanding benchmarks,
and even surpasses larger models up to 13B parameters. Notably, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance in referring expression comprehension with a score
of 88.9, surpassing the previous best of 87.4. Our results suggest that
training on the refined scene graph data is crucial to maintaining high
performance across diverse visual reasoning task.

Conclusion: FMaMIL在数字病理学中具有潜力，有效解决了标注成本高的问题。

Abstract: Accurate lesion segmentation in histopathology images is essential for
diagnostic interpretation and quantitative analysis, yet it remains challenging
due to the limited availability of costly pixel-level annotations. To address
this, we propose FMaMIL, a novel two-stage framework for weakly supervised
lesion segmentation based solely on image-level labels. In the first stage, a
lightweight Mamba-based encoder is introduced to capture long-range
dependencies across image patches under the MIL paradigm. To enhance spatial
sensitivity and structural awareness, we design a learnable frequency-domain
encoding module that supplements spatial-domain features with spectrum-based
information. CAMs generated in this stage are used to guide segmentation
training. In the second stage, we refine the initial pseudo labels via a
CAM-guided soft-label supervision and a self-correction mechanism, enabling
robust training even under label noise. Extensive experiments on both public
and private histopathology datasets demonstrate that FMaMIL outperforms
state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods without relying on pixel-level
annotations, validating its effectiveness and potential for digital pathology
applications.

Motivation: 当前3D高斯溅射在宽基线场景下因纹理细节不足和几何不一致性导致性能下降，需要改进。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先生成3D高斯基元，其次通过改进模型（基于扩散模型，结合MORI和DWEA）增强渲染视图。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和DL3DV-10K数据集上，ProSplat的PSNR平均提升1 dB。

Conclusion: ProSplat通过两阶段设计和优化策略，显著提升了宽基线条件下的渲染质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated promising
results for novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, particularly
under narrow-baseline conditions. However, its performance significantly
degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and
geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for
high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage
involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second
stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement
model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion
model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view
Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI
supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference
view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency
using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer
training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through
joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K
datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that
ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent
SOTA methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
neural scene reconstruction, offering high-quality novel view synthesis while
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we extend the capabilities
of 3DGS beyond pure scene representation by introducing an approach for
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without requiring manual labeling,
termed OpenSplat3D. Our method leverages feature-splatting techniques to
associate semantic information with individual Gaussians, enabling fine-grained
scene understanding. We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with
a contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve
accurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language
embeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven
instance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and
segment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.
We show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++
validation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: 3D AI-generated content (AIGC) has made it increasingly accessible for anyone
to become a 3D content creator. While recent methods leverage Score
Distillation Sampling to distill 3D objects from pretrained image diffusion
models, they often suffer from inadequate 3D priors, leading to insufficient
multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce NOVA3D, an innovative
single-image-to-3D generation framework. Our key insight lies in leveraging
strong 3D priors from a pretrained video diffusion model and integrating
geometric information during multi-view video fine-tuning. To facilitate
information exchange between color and geometric domains, we propose the
Geometry-Temporal Alignment (GTA) attention mechanism, thereby improving
generalization and multi-view consistency. Moreover, we introduce the
de-conflict geometry fusion algorithm, which improves texture fidelity by

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态滤波网络，通过全局和局部分支处理两种主要退化类型，显著提升了图像重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视不同退化类型的多样性，采用单一网络模型处理多种退化，效果不佳。

Method: 引入动态滤波网络，分为全局和局部分支：全局分支处理空间无关主导退化（如下采样和噪声），局部分支处理空间相关主导退化（如模糊）。

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上，该方法优于现有盲超分辨率算法。

Conclusion: 动态滤波网络能有效区分和处理两种退化类型，显著提升图像重建质量。

Abstract: Prior methodologies have disregarded the diversities among distinct
degradation types during image reconstruction, employing a uniform network
model to handle multiple deteriorations. Nevertheless, we discover that
prevalent degradation modalities, including sampling, blurring, and noise, can
be roughly categorized into two classes. We classify the first class as
spatial-agnostic dominant degradations, less affected by regional changes in
image space, such as downsampling and noise degradation. The second class
degradation type is intimately associated with the spatial position of the
image, such as blurring, and we identify them as spatial-specific dominant
degradations. We introduce a dynamic filter network integrating global and
local branches to address these two degradation types. This network can greatly
alleviate the practical degradation problem. Specifically, the global dynamic
filtering layer can perceive the spatial-agnostic dominant degradation in
different images by applying weights generated by the attention mechanism to
multiple parallel standard convolution kernels, enhancing the network's
representation ability. Meanwhile, the local dynamic filtering layer converts
feature maps of the image into a spatially specific dynamic filtering operator,
which performs spatially specific convolution operations on the image features
to handle spatial-specific dominant degradations. By effectively integrating
both global and local dynamic filtering operators, our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art blind super-resolution algorithms in both
synthetic and real image datasets.

TL;DR: FlowV2V提出了一种基于光流的视频编辑方法，通过分解任务为第一帧编辑和条件图像到视频生成，显著提升了复杂运动建模的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法难以处理复杂运动模式（如非刚性物体运动），而光流为复杂运动建模提供了新思路。

Method: FlowV2V将任务分解为第一帧编辑和条件I2V生成，通过模拟伪光流序列确保编辑一致性。

Result: 在DAVIS-EDIT数据集上，FlowV2V在DOVER和warping error指标上分别提升了13.67%和50.66%。

Conclusion: FlowV2V在复杂运动建模和视频编辑中表现出色，光流驱动的I2V生成方法具有潜力。

Abstract: With the prosper of video diffusion models, down-stream applications like
video editing have been significantly promoted without consuming much
computational cost. One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion
transfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the
consideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the
temporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods
fail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are
fundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object
motions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this
paper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex
motion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task
of flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V
decomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V
generation, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed
shape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on
DAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error
illustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V
compared to existing state-of-the-art ones. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the internal functionalities of the
first-frame paradigm and flow alignment in the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN的二进制激活映射常因信息不足导致准确性下降，需改进以提升性能。

Method: 采用实值激活与二进制权重，引入可训练因子自适应学习权重幅度，推理时通过重参数化恢复标准形式。

Result: 在各种网络架构和数据集上，ReverB-SNN表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReverB-SNN在保持SNN高效性的同时，显著提升了信息容量和准确性。

Abstract: The Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a biologically inspired neural network
infrastructure, has garnered significant attention recently. SNNs utilize
binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing
multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However,
binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information,
resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing
the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN},
inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from
quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs
real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves
the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while
enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a
trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight
amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain
efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight
SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique
during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures
and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中大模型推理速度慢的问题，同时保留其高信息量的优势。

Method: 采用异步系统ETA，结合大模型的未来预测和小模型的实时特征提取，通过动作掩码机制整合双重特征。

Result: 在Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2基准测试中，ETA将驾驶分数提升至69.53，性能提升8%，同时保持50ms的近实时推理速度。

Conclusion: ETA通过异步设计和特征整合，成功实现了大模型的快速响应和高性能，为自动驾驶系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a
common dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system
architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a
larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system
designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either
directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved
from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle
to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key
insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous
time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large
models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we
introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system
designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current
frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame
features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate
these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes
action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA
Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with
a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at
50 ms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的低功耗单目3D目标检测架构SpikeSMOKE，通过跨尺度门控编码机制（CSGC）增强特征表示，并引入轻量级残差块以减少计算量。实验表明，该方法在KITTI数据集上性能显著提升，同时大幅降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D目标检测在自动驾驶等领域的广泛应用，高能耗问题日益突出。SNNs因其低功耗特性成为潜在解决方案，但其离散信号会导致信息损失，限制了特征表达能力。

Method: 提出SpikeSMOKE架构，结合跨尺度门控编码机制（CSGC）增强特征表示，并设计轻量级残差块以减少计算量和训练时间。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，SpikeSMOKE性能显著提升（如Easy类别提升2.82），同时能耗降低72.2%（Hard类别）。轻量版SpikeSMOKE-L进一步减少参数和计算量。

Conclusion: SpikeSMOKE通过CSGC和轻量设计，实现了低功耗高性能的单目3D目标检测，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Low energy consumption for 3D object detection is an important research area
because of the increasing energy consumption with their wide application in
fields such as autonomous driving. The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with
low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this
research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose
the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power
monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will
generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared
with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,
inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose
a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature
representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated
filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the
speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can
maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection
performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection,
the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2,
Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by
AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the
results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to
the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by
72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only
4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3
times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师需要标准化资产库，但现有生成模型未充分满足这一需求。开放世界场景提供了丰富素材，但提取高质量资产仍困难。

Method: 提出AssetDropper框架，通过预训练奖励模型实现闭环反馈，处理复杂场景如透视变形和遮挡。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，AssetDropper在资产提取任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AssetDropper为设计师提供了高效的资产提取工具，并通过奖励驱动优化提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent research on generative models has primarily focused on creating
product-ready visual outputs; however, designers often favor access to
standardized asset libraries, a domain that has yet to be significantly
enhanced by generative capabilities. Although open-world scenes provide ample
raw materials for designers, efficiently extracting high-quality, standardized
assets remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce AssetDropper, the
first framework designed to extract assets from reference images, providing
artists with an open-world asset palette. Our model adeptly extracts a front
view of selected subjects from input images, effectively handling complex
scenarios such as perspective distortion and subject occlusion. We establish a
synthetic dataset of more than 200,000 image-subject pairs and a real-world
benchmark with thousands more for evaluation, facilitating the exploration of
future research in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to ensure precise asset
extraction that aligns well with the image prompts, we employ a pre-trained
reward model to fulfill a closed-loop with feedback. We design the reward model
to perform an inverse task that pastes the extracted assets back into the
reference sources, which assists training with additional consistency and
mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments show that, with the aid of
reward-driven optimization, AssetDropper achieves the state-of-the-art results
in asset extraction. Project page: AssetDropper.github.io.

Motivation: 传统建筑文化研究依赖主观专家解读和历史文献，存在区域偏见和解释范围有限的问题。

Method: 构建ArchDiffBench数据集（1,765张高质量建筑图像及风格标注），开发基于视觉语言模型的ArchiLense框架，结合计算机视觉和深度学习技术。

Result: ArchiLense在建筑风格识别中表现优异，与专家标注一致性达92.4%，分类准确率为84.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法超越了传统分析的主观性，为建筑文化比较研究提供了更客观、准确的视角。

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic
diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition
to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the
ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects
from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery.
However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on
subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often
suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these
challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a
professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises
1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style
annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We
propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models
and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced
computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms,
ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise
classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language
outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show
that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition,
with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification
accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The
proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses
and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of
architectural culture.

Conclusion: Flow-Anything首次展示了从大规模真实图像生成光流训练数据的优势，为光流估计和视频任务提供了基础模型。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a crucial subfield of computer vision, serving as
a foundation for video tasks. However, the real-world robustness is limited by
animated synthetic datasets for training. This introduces domain gaps when
applied to real-world applications and limits the benefits of scaling up
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Flow-Anything}, a
large-scale data generation framework designed to learn optical flow estimation
from any single-view images in the real world. We employ two effective steps to
make data scaling-up promising. First, we convert a single-view image into a 3D
representation using advanced monocular depth estimation networks. This allows
us to render optical flow and novel view images under a virtual camera. Second,
we develop an Object-Independent Volume Rendering module and a Depth-Aware
Inpainting module to model the dynamic objects in the 3D representation. These
two steps allow us to generate realistic datasets for training from large-scale
single-view images, namely \textbf{FA-Flow Dataset}. For the first time, we
demonstrate the benefits of generating optical flow training data from
large-scale real-world images, outperforming the most advanced unsupervised
methods and supervised methods on synthetic datasets. Moreover, our models
serve as a foundation model and enhance the performance of various downstream
video tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法通常局限于特定模型（如InstructPix2Pix），可能导致偏见或编辑能力受限，因此需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 通过Delta Interpolation提取差异，结合Token Consistency Loss和Zero Initialization of Token Embeddings，构建适合稳定扩散模型的Full Prompt。

Result: 实验表明，Difference Inversion在定量和定性上均优于现有基线，能够以模型无关的方式生成更可行的B'。

Conclusion: Difference Inversion是一种高效且通用的方法，能够在不依赖特定模型的情况下生成高质量的图像编辑结果。

Abstract: How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B', given the input
images A,A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches
like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However, these methods
are typically limited to specific models (e.g. InstructPix2Pix. Inpainting
models) rather than general diffusion models (e.g. Stable Diffusion, SDXL).
This dependency may lead to inherited biases or lower editing capabilities. In
this paper, we propose Difference Inversion, a method that isolates only the
difference from A and A' and applies it to B to generate a plausible B'. To
address model dependency, it is crucial to structure prompts in the form of a
"Full Prompt" suitable for input to stable diffusion models, rather than using
an "Instruction Prompt". To this end, we accurately extract the Difference
between A and A' and combine it with the prompt of B, enabling a plug-and-play
application of the difference. To extract a precise difference, we first
identify it through 1) Delta Interpolation. Additionally, to ensure accurate
training, we propose the 2) Token Consistency Loss and 3) Zero Initialization
of Token Embeddings. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Difference
Inversion outperforms existing baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively,
indicating its ability to generate more feasible B' in a model-agnostic manner.

extracts focused visual embeddings by masking non-garment regions via semantic
segmentation followed by feature extraction using pretrained CNN backbones
(ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, VGG16). To simulate realistic shopping behavior, we
generate synthetic purchase histories influenced by user-specific trendiness
and item popularity. Recommendations are computed using a weighted scoring
function that fuses visual similarity, semantic coherence and popularity
alignment. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate consistent gender
alignment and improved category relevance, with ResNet-50 achieving 64.95%
category similarity and lowest popularity MAE. An ablation study confirms the
complementary roles of visual and popularity cues. Our method provides a

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has
fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal visual-text reasoning capabilities.
However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) to date suffer from
generalization performance. Inspired by recent development in LLMs for visual
reasoning, this paper presents VLAgent, an AI system that can create a
step-by-step visual reasoning plan with an easy-to-understand script and
execute each step of the plan in real time by integrating planning script with
execution verifications via an automated process supported by VLAgent. In the
task planning phase, VLAgent fine-tunes an LLM through in-context learning to
generate a step-by-step planner for each user-submitted text-visual reasoning
task. During the plan execution phase, VLAgent progressively refines the
composition of neuro-symbolic executable modules to generate high-confidence
reasoning results. VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we
improve the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving
logic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM
hallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and
correct additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to
launching the plan executor. Finally, we employ the ensemble method to improve
the generalization performance of our step-executor. Extensive experiments with
four visual reasoning benchmarks (GQA, MME, NLVR2, VQAv2) show that VLAgent
achieves significant performance enhancement for multimodal text-visual
reasoning applications, compared to the exiting representative VLMs and LLM
based visual composition approaches like ViperGPT and VisProg, thanks to the
novel optimization modules of VLAgent back-engine (SS-Parser, Plan Repairer,
Output Verifiers). Code and data will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Method: 构建了一个包含1,369对对齐图像的双光谱数据集，并提出了一种结合融合速度、通用指标和目标检测性能的评估框架。

Result: 实验表明，针对下游任务优化的融合模型在目标检测中表现更优，尤其是在低光和遮挡场景下。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括高质量数据集、任务感知的评估框架以及对现有方法的全面分析，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Visible images offer rich texture details, while infrared images emphasize
salient targets. Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene
understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging
conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention,
but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without
standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack
of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders
progress.
  To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset
captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared
image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke
occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation
framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection
performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in
downstream evaluation.
  Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms
under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for
downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially
in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on
general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting
limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our
proposed framework.
  The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum
dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive
evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion
methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly improved performance in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks
through multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
methods still face challenges, such as the scarcity of knowledge with reasoning
examples and erratic responses from retrieved knowledge. To address these
issues, in this study, we propose a multimodal RAG framework, termed RCTS,
which enhances LVLMs by constructing a Reasoning Context-enriched knowledge
base and a Tree Search re-ranking method. Specifically, we introduce a
self-consistent evaluation mechanism to enrich the knowledge base with
intrinsic reasoning patterns. We further propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search with
Heuristic Rewards (MCTS-HR) to prioritize the most relevant examples. This
ensures that LVLMs can leverage high-quality contextual reasoning for better
and more consistent responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VQA datasets,
significantly outperforming In-Context Learning (ICL) and Vanilla-RAG methods.
It highlights the effectiveness of our knowledge base and re-ranking method in
improving LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/yannqi/RCTS-RAG.

Abstract: Vision encoders are increasingly used in modern applications, from
vision-only models to multimodal systems such as vision-language models.
Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures
represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for
interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related
model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training
objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain
significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such
as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision
encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations.
Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable
changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather
than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be
applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its
feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are
available in GitHub.

Conclusion: UGTSR框架有效提升了超分辨率任务的性能，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Recent advancements in codebook-based real image super-resolution (SR) have
shown promising results in real-world applications. The core idea involves
matching high-quality image features from a codebook based on low-resolution
(LR) image features. However, existing methods face two major challenges:
inaccurate feature matching with the codebook and poor texture detail
reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key
components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to
focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that
enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and
(3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information
between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to
existing methods. We will release the code upon formal publication.

Motivation: 现有VideoQA方法依赖显式视觉证据，但在涉及符号意义或深层意图的问题中表现不佳，因此需要解决隐式视觉证据问题。

Method: 提出IRM框架，包含AIM（生成线索候选并推理关系）和VEM（增强视觉表示），通过双流建模处理隐式问题。

Result: IRM在I-VQA任务中表现优于GPT-4o、OpenAI-o3和VideoChat2，提升幅度分别为0.76%、1.37%和4.87%。

Conclusion: IRM有效解决了隐式视觉证据问题，并在广告理解和交通预测等任务中达到SOTA性能。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions
based on the given video, with prior work primarily focusing on identifying the
duration of relevant segments, referred to as explicit visual evidence.
However, explicit visual evidence is not always directly available,
particularly when questions target symbolic meanings or deeper intentions,
leading to significant performance degradation. To fill this gap, we introduce
a novel task and dataset, $\textbf{I}$mplicit $\textbf{V}$ideo
$\textbf{Q}$uestion $\textbf{A}$nswering (I-VQA), which focuses on answering
questions in scenarios where explicit visual evidence is inaccessible. Given an
implicit question and its corresponding video, I-VQA requires answering based
on the contextual visual cues present within the video. To tackle I-VQA, we
propose a novel reasoning framework, IRM (Implicit Reasoning Model),
incorporating dual-stream modeling of contextual actions and intent clues as
implicit reasoning chains. IRM comprises the Action-Intent Module (AIM) and the
Visual Enhancement Module (VEM). AIM deduces and preserves question-related
dual clues by generating clue candidates and performing relation deduction. VEM
enhances contextual visual representation by leveraging key contextual clues.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our IRM in I-VQA tasks,
outperforming GPT-4o, OpenAI-o3, and fine-tuned VideoChat2 by $0.76\%$,
$1.37\%$, and $4.87\%$, respectively. Additionally, IRM performs SOTA on
similar implicit advertisement understanding and future prediction in
traffic-VQA. Datasets and codes are available for double-blind review in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定尺度超分辨率灵活性不足，而现有单阶段方法难以学习广泛的连续尺度分布。

Method: 采用自级联扩散框架，将任意尺度需求分解为更小的顺序因子，逐步提升分辨率，并引入坐标引导的残差扩散模型。

Result: CasArbi在多种任意尺度超分辨率基准测试中，在感知和失真性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CasArbi通过分阶段扩散和坐标引导残差模型，实现了高效且灵活的任意尺度图像超分辨率。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale image super-resolution aims to upsample images to any desired
resolution, offering greater flexibility than traditional fixed-scale
super-resolution. Recent approaches in this domain utilize regression-based or
generative models, but many of them are a single-stage upsampling process,
which may be challenging to learn across a wide, continuous distribution of
scaling factors. Progressive upsampling strategies have shown promise in
mitigating this issue, yet their integration with diffusion models for flexible
upscaling remains underexplored. Here, we present CasArbi, a novel
self-cascaded diffusion framework for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution.
CasArbi meets the varying scaling demands by breaking them down into smaller
sequential factors and progressively enhancing the image resolution at each
step with seamless transitions for arbitrary scales. Our novel
coordinate-guided residual diffusion model allows for the learning of
continuous image representations while enabling efficient diffusion sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CasArbi outperforms prior arts in
both perceptual and distortion performance metrics across diverse
arbitrary-scale super-resolution benchmarks.

TL;DR: M2Restore提出了一种基于Mixture-of-Experts的Mamba-CNN融合框架，用于高效且鲁棒的全能图像恢复，解决了现有方法在动态退化场景下泛化能力不足和局部细节与全局依赖平衡不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然图像常受复合退化（如雨、雪、雾）影响，现有方法在动态退化场景下泛化能力有限，且难以平衡局部细节与全局依赖。

Method: 1. 使用CLIP引导的MoE门控机制融合任务条件提示和CLIP语义先验；2. 设计双流架构结合CNN局部表征能力和Mamba长程建模效率；3. 引入边缘感知动态门控机制自适应平衡全局与局部。

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准测试中，M2Restore在视觉质量和定量性能上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: M2Restore通过创新的架构和机制，显著提升了图像恢复的泛化能力和细节保留效果。

Abstract: Natural images are often degraded by complex, composite degradations such as
rain, snow, and haze, which adversely impact downstream vision applications.
While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they
are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across
dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between
preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these
challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image
restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the
model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a
CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with
CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal
feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various
degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies
and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that
integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range
modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative
optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,
preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we
introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances
global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention
to degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient
and precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image
restoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual
quality and quantitative performance.

Abstract: Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and
safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential.
Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to
scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast,
neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a
scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world
driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and
reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result
in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper
introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome
these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into
existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and
consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel
dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an
image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into
neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic
integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2
significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like
text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing
for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable
and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型在小噪声情况下的行为，填补其在低噪声扩散动态中的理解空白，以提高模型鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 使用CelebA子集和解析高斯混合基准，系统分析模型在低噪声条件下的行为。

Result: 模型在数据流形附近的行为会因训练数据不同而发散，即使高噪声输出收敛。

Conclusion: 研究为生成模型在实际应用中的可靠性提供了新见解，特别是在小扰动常见的情况下。

Abstract: Recent work on diffusion models proposed that they operate in two regimes:
memorization, in which models reproduce their training data, and
generalization, in which they generate novel samples. While this has been
tested in high-noise settings, the behavior of diffusion models as effective
denoisers when the corruption level is small remains unclear. To address this
gap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under
low-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and
interpretability. Using (i) CelebA subsets of varying sample sizes and (ii)
analytic Gaussian mixture benchmarks, we reveal that models trained on disjoint
data diverge near the data manifold even when their high-noise outputs
converge. We quantify how training set size, data geometry, and model objective
choice shape denoising trajectories and affect score accuracy, providing
insights into how these models actually learn representations of data
distributions. This work starts to address gaps in our understanding of
generative model reliability in practical applications where small
perturbations are common.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割在环境监测和城市规划中至关重要，但传统方法存在计算和优化挑战，如细节丢失或全局上下文碎片化。

Method: F2Net将图像分解为高频和低频成分，高频分支保留全分辨率结构细节，低频分支通过双子分支捕获短程和长程依赖关系，并通过混合频率融合模块整合。

Conclusion: F2Net通过频率分解和融合模块，结合新颖的损失函数，实现了高效且稳定的训练，在超高分辨率遥感图像分割中表现优异。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing imagery
is critical for applications like environmental monitoring and urban planning
but faces computational and optimization challenges. Conventional methods
either lose fine details through downsampling or fragment global context via
patch processing. While multi-branch networks address this trade-off, they
suffer from computational inefficiency and conflicting gradient dynamics during
training. We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR
images into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The
high-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the
low-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches
capturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module
integrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency
Alignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and
Cross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to
stabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net
achieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,
respectively. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: PolyVivid在多主题视频定制中实现了灵活且身份一致的生成，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in video generation, existing models still lack
fine-grained controllability, especially for multi-subject customization with
consistent identity and interaction. In this paper, we propose PolyVivid, a
multi-subject video customization framework that enables flexible and
identity-consistent generation. To establish accurate correspondences between
subject images and textual entities, we design a VLLM-based text-image fusion
module that embeds visual identities into the textual space for precise
grounding. To further enhance identity preservation and subject interaction, we
propose a 3D-RoPE-based enhancement module that enables structured
bidirectional fusion between text and image embeddings. Moreover, we develop an
attention-inherited identity injection module to effectively inject fused
identity features into the video generation process, mitigating identity drift.
Finally, we construct an MLLM-based data pipeline that combines MLLM-based
grounding, segmentation, and a clique-based subject consolidation strategy to
produce high-quality multi-subject data, effectively enhancing subject
distinction and reducing ambiguity in downstream video generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PolyVivid achieves superior performance in
identity fidelity, video realism, and subject alignment, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因标注数据稀缺而发展受限的问题。

Method: 结合SMART-OD（自动掩码生成与开放世界目标检测）和FLASH（多目标实时视频实例分割），通过统计方法减少检测错误并保持对象跟踪一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SAM2Auto的标注精度与人工相当，同时大幅减少时间和成本，适用于多样化数据集。

Conclusion: SAM2Auto为自动视频标注设定了新基准，加速了VLM的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the
scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations
is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets
requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach
consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that
combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection
capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a
multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains
consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent
detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require
frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives,
our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while
ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves
comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation
time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse
datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments,
making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work
establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a
pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset
bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.

Result: 在两个室内和一个室外数据集上，LogoSP大幅超越现有无监督方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LogoSP证明了全局模式能有效捕捉无监督训练中的3D语义信息。

Abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation on raw point
clouds without needing human labels in training. Existing methods usually
formulate this problem into learning per-point local features followed by a
simple grouping strategy, lacking the ability to discover additional and
possibly richer semantic priors beyond local features. In this paper, we
introduce LogoSP to learn 3D semantics from both local and global point
features. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic information by
grouping superpoints according to their global patterns in the frequency
domain, thus generating highly accurate semantic pseudo-labels for training a
segmentation network. Extensive experiments on two indoor and an outdoor
datasets show that our LogoSP surpasses all existing unsupervised methods by
large margins, achieving the state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised 3D
semantic segmentation. Notably, our investigation into the learned global
patterns reveals that they truly represent meaningful 3D semantics in the
absence of human labels during training.

Conclusion: 这是首个利用事件相机从第一人称视角预测乒乓球轨迹的方法，展示了事件相机在高动态场景中的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a real-time egocentric trajectory prediction system
for table tennis using event cameras. Unlike standard cameras, which suffer
from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide
higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater
robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short
time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game
sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized
with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our
system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to
process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach
improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational
latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually
relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected
trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,
including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based
30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.
Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the
ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from
an egocentric perspective using event cameras.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remain a cornerstone of generative computer
vision, yet their training is often plagued by artifacts that degrade
reconstruction and generation quality. This paper introduces VIVAT, a
systematic approach to mitigating common artifacts in KL-VAE training without
requiring radical architectural changes. We present a detailed taxonomy of five
prevalent artifacts - color shift, grid patterns, blur, corner and droplet
artifacts - and analyze their root causes. Through straightforward
modifications, including adjustments to loss weights, padding strategies, and
the integration of Spatially Conditional Normalization, we demonstrate
significant improvements in VAE performance. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across
multiple benchmarks and enhances text-to-image generation quality, as evidenced
by superior CLIP scores. By preserving the simplicity of the KL-VAE framework
while addressing its practical challenges, VIVAT offers actionable insights for
researchers and practitioners aiming to optimize VAE training.

Conclusion: FreeGave成功学习了无标签的3D物理运动模式，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and the
underlying physics purely from multi-view videos. By applying various governing
PDEs as PINN losses or incorporating physics simulation into neural networks,
existing works often fail to learn complex physical motions at boundaries or
require object priors such as masks or types. In this paper, we propose
FreeGave to learn the physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes without needing any
object priors. The key to our approach is to introduce a physics code followed
by a carefully designed divergence-free module for estimating a per-Gaussian
velocity field, without relying on the inefficient PINN losses. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets and a newly collected challenging
real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method for
future frame extrapolation and motion segmentation. Most notably, our
investigation into the learned physics codes reveals that they truly learn
meaningful 3D physical motion patterns in the absence of any human labels in
training.

Abstract: Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with
standard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion
estimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.
In such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.
Although recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown
remarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.
Conversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are
computationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient
spatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better
performance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce
Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network
architecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive

Abstract: With the increasing availability of aerial and satellite imagery, deep
learning presents significant potential for transportation asset management,
safety analysis, and urban planning. This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a
robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types
of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet
incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object
detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing
detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their
orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block
Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine
annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A
comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is
utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing
model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial
imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness.
CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire,
Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its
robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk
detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms
and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data
processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility
applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers,
and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and
improve urban mobility.

Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video,
depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented
reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction. These capabilities enable
systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and
surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal
and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently
heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and
settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or
head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard
supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera
motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video
pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal
foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal
tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from
temporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for
egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across
diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,
egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric
video. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric
video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist
models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source
EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project

Motivation: 视频生成模型可能继承训练数据中的偏见和有害内容，导致用户生成不良或非法内容的风险。

Method: 通过计算安全与不安全示例的潜在差异生成拒绝向量，并采用低秩分解方法优化拒绝向量的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法能有效中和多种有害内容（如裸露、暴力、版权等），且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: 提出的无学习技术无需重新训练或原始数据，直接嵌入拒绝方向到模型权重中，提高了对抗规避的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through
intuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful
concepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance
creates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even
illegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored
explicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our
method requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a "safe"
and an "unsafe" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their
per-layer latent differences produces a "refusal vector", which, once
subtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We
introduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference
of embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target
concept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus
preserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the
model's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the
original training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the
model's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust
against adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output
filters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we
can neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,
graphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks. Project page:

Conclusion: 自动化数据管道可持续增加数据多样性，进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,
extending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While
recent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning
(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on
domain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question
remains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning
through RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel
Scalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates
context-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the
given images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K
multimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse
dataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive
exploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that
combines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL
training efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM
benchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances
performance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.
Moreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase
data diversity to further improve model performance.

Result: 分析强调了处理多时相数据及长距离关系对提升变化检测精度的重要性。

Conclusion: 本研究为选择U-Net变体进行遥感变化检测的研究者和从业者提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring the everchanging
landscapes of the Earth. The U-Net architecture has gained popularity for its
capability to capture spatial information and perform pixel-wise
classification. However, their application in the Remote sensing field remains
largely unexplored. Therefore, this paper fill the gap by conducting a
comprehensive analysis of 34 papers. This study conducts a comparison and
analysis of 18 different U-Net variations, assessing their potential for
detecting changes in remote sensing. We evaluate both benefits along with
drawbacks of each variation within the framework of this particular
application. We emphasize variations that are explicitly built for change
detection, such as Siamese Swin-U-Net, which utilizes a Siamese architecture.
The analysis highlights the significance of aspects such as managing data from
different time periods and collecting relationships over a long distance to
enhance the precision of change detection. This study provides valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners that choose U-Net versions for
remote sensing change detection tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态上下文学习（MM-ICL）中表现不佳，倾向于依赖浅层启发式方法而非真正任务理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否真正具备多模态上下文学习能力，尤其是在分布变化的情况下。

Method: 提出一种新的MM-ICL推理流程，为每个示例生成答案的同时附加理由，并在不同规模模型上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs对示例信息的利用有限，性能提升不明显。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态上下文学习中表现不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are widely assumed to exhibit in-context
learning (ICL), a property similar to that of their language-only counterparts.
While recent work suggests VLMs can perform multimodal ICL (MM-ICL), studies
show they often rely on shallow heuristics -- such as copying or majority
voting -- rather than true task understanding. We revisit this assumption by
evaluating VLMs under distribution shifts, where support examples come from a
dataset different from the query. Surprisingly, performance often degrades with
more demonstrations, and models tend to copy answers rather than learn from
them. To investigate further, we propose a new MM-ICL with Reasoning pipeline
that augments each demonstration with a generated rationale alongside the
answer. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on both perception-
and reasoning-required datasets with open-source VLMs ranging from 3B to 72B
and proprietary models such as Gemini 2.0. We conduct controlled studies
varying shot count, retrieval method, rationale quality, and distribution. Our
results show limited performance sensitivity across these factors, suggesting
that current VLMs do not effectively utilize demonstration-level information as
intended in MM-ICL.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明DT表示是视觉与文本间的有效桥梁。

Conclusion: DT表示能够支持复杂多模态推理任务，仅需LLM即可完成。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires
segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise
visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches
rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and
reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous
spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS
approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate
layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger
reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image
into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and
semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform
explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We
propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT
representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to
enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments
show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS
benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT
representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text,
enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an
LLM.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何将大量手写档案材料转化为结构化数据，支持历史和人口学研究。

Abstract: This article presents a large-scale effort to create a structured dataset of
internal migration in Finland between 1800 and 1920 using digitized church
moving records. These records, maintained by Evangelical-Lutheran parishes,
document the migration of individuals and families and offer a valuable source
for studying historical demographic patterns. The dataset includes over six
million entries extracted from approximately 200,000 images of handwritten
migration records.
  The data extraction process was automated using a deep learning pipeline that
included layout analysis, table detection, cell classification, and handwriting
recognition. The complete pipeline was applied to all images, resulting in a
structured dataset suitable for research.
  The dataset can be used to study internal migration, urbanization, and family
migration, and the spread of disease in preindustrial Finland. A case study
from the Elim\"aki parish shows how local migration histories can be
reconstructed. The work demonstrates how large volumes of handwritten archival
material can be transformed into structured data to support historical and
demographic research.

Motivation: 现有基准难以全面评估MLLMs从原子到组合层面的空间智能，因此需要SpaCE-10填补这一空白。

Method: 定义了10种原子空间能力和8种组合能力，采用分层标注流程生成高质量QA对，覆盖多种评估设置。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的MLLM在空间智能上仍显著落后于人类，且计数能力的不足限制了组合空间能力。

Conclusion: SpaCE-10为MLLM社区提供了重要发现和评估工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require
integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic
tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the
spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional
level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for
compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial
capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on
these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to
generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+
hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor
scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud
input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs
on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans
by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant
findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the
shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial
capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在理解长或复杂视频时存在计算需求高、鲁棒性差和准确性不足的问题，尤其是参数较少的模型表现更差。

Method: CyberV框架引入了一个控制论循环，包括MLLM推理系统、传感器和控制器，通过监控和反馈实现动态调整。

Result: 实验显示，CyberV显著提升了多个模型的性能，如Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升8.3%，InternVL3-8B提升5.5%，甚至接近人类专家水平。

Conclusion: CyberV有效增强了MLLMs的动态视频理解能力，具有广泛适用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may struggle with
understanding long or complex videos due to computational demands at test time,
lack of robustness, and limited accuracy, primarily stemming from their
feed-forward processing nature. These limitations could be more severe for
models with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as
adaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic
resource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a
cybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a
Controller. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and
collects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the
controller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate
feedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework
enhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.
Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B
by 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive
proprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%
improvement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.
Furthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose
benchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for
dynamic video understanding. The code is released at

Result: OneIG-Bench提供了灵活的评估方式，允许用户针对特定维度生成图像并完成评估，代码和数据集已公开。

Conclusion: OneIG-Bench为T2I研究社区提供了系统化的评估工具，有助于识别模型性能的优劣势。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating
high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model
advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive
evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and
style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge
modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems
requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not
adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we
introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark
framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,
including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated
content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this
benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers
and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of
image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by
allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of
generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only
for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the
corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly
available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model
comparisons within the T2I research community.

demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need
for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method
for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football

previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed
classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a
manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization
to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of
CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating
state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare
disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and
zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded
dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical
settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the
insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the
development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for
chest radiography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经元解释方法的可靠性难以评估，且人群评估成本高、噪声大。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入重要性采样选择最有价值的输入，并提出贝叶斯方法聚合评分，显著降低评估成本。

Result: 实现了约30倍的成本降低和约5倍的评分数量减少，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在大规模研究中验证了其有效性，为神经元解释的评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Interpreting individual neurons or directions in activations space is an
important component of mechanistic interpretability. As such, many algorithms
have been proposed to automatically produce neuron explanations, but it is
often not clear how reliable these explanations are, or which methods produce
the best explanations. This can be measured via crowd-sourced evaluations, but
they can often be noisy and expensive, leading to unreliable results. In this
paper, we carefully analyze the evaluation pipeline and develop a
cost-effective and highly accurate crowdsourced evaluation strategy. In
contrast to previous human studies that only rate whether the explanation
matches the most highly activating inputs, we estimate whether the explanation
describes neuron activations across all inputs. To estimate this effectively,
we introduce a novel application of importance sampling to determine which
inputs are the most valuable to show to raters, leading to around 30x cost
reduction compared to uniform sampling. We also analyze the label noise present
in crowd-sourced evaluations and propose a Bayesian method to aggregate
multiple ratings leading to a further ~5x reduction in number of ratings
required for the same accuracy. Finally, we use these methods to conduct a
large-scale study comparing the quality of neuron explanations produced by the
most popular methods for two different vision models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TACA的方法，通过动态调整跨模态注意力的温度和时序感知权重，解决了MM-DiT模型中文本与图像对齐不精确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MM-DiT模型（如FLUX）在文本驱动的视觉生成中表现优异，但在文本提示与生成内容对齐方面仍存在不足，主要由于跨模态注意力不平衡和缺乏时序感知权重。

Method: 提出Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention (TACA)，通过温度缩放和时序相关调整动态平衡多模态交互，并结合LoRA微调。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench基准测试中，TACA显著提升了文本-图像对齐效果，尤其在物体外观、属性绑定和空间关系方面。

Conclusion: TACA通过优化跨模态注意力平衡，显著提升了文本到图像扩散模型的语义保真度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress
in text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models
like FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and
generated content. We identify two key issues in the attention mechanism of
MM-DiT, namely 1) the suppression of cross-modal attention due to token
imbalance between visual and textual modalities and 2) the lack of
timestep-aware attention weighting, which hinder the alignment. To address
these issues, we propose \textbf{Temperature-Adjusted Cross-modal Attention
(TACA)}, a parameter-efficient method that dynamically rebalances multimodal
interactions through temperature scaling and timestep-dependent adjustment.
When combined with LoRA fine-tuning, TACA significantly enhances text-image
alignment on the T2I-CompBench benchmark with minimal computational overhead.
We tested TACA on state-of-the-art models like FLUX and SD3.5, demonstrating
its ability to improve image-text alignment in terms of object appearance,
attribute binding, and spatial relationships. Our findings highlight the
importance of balancing cross-modal attention in improving semantic fidelity in
text-to-image diffusion models. Our codes are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于示例的编辑方法仍需依赖文本描述或隐式文本指令，难以精确指定某些编辑语义。

Method: 提出目标噪声预测和内容保持噪声调度，优化LoRAs以分离语义变化与内容学习。

Result: PairEdit成功学习复杂语义，内容一致性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PairEdit为无需文本的视觉编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable
success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic
control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify
precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves
learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing
exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change
within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In
this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to
effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image
pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We
propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations
within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce
a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic
learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning
of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics
while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: UA-Pose是一种不确定性感知的6D物体姿态估计方法，针对部分参考信息设计，显著提升了在不完整观测下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要完整3D模型或大量参考图像，而部分参考信息下的6D姿态估计仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于有限RGBD图像或单张2D图像生成部分3D模型，引入不确定性区分可见与不可见区域，指导在线物体补全。

Result: 在YCB-Video等数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在不完整观测下。

Conclusion: UA-Pose通过不确定性感知策略，提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性和物体完整性。

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.
However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed
3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating
6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's
appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose
UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online
object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume
access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a
single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model
based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use
image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method
integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between
seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose
estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object
completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving
object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and
HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots
and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are
incomplete or partially captured. Project page:

TL;DR: MADFormer是一种混合自回归和扩散变换器的模型，用于分析AR-扩散权衡，通过分区和混合层设计提升高分辨率图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合模型缺乏系统指导，无法明确如何分配自回归和扩散模型的能力。

Method: MADFormer将图像生成分为空间块，使用AR层进行全局条件化，扩散层进行局部细化。

Result: 实验表明，块分区显著提升高分辨率图像性能，混合层设计在有限计算下提升FID达75%。

Conclusion: 研究为未来混合生成模型提供了实用设计原则。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined
autoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their
complementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce
fluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous
latent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids
often lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity
between these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed
Autoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing
AR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial
blocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and
diffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through
controlled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:
(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on
high-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers
yields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under
constrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles
for future hybrid generative models.

Conclusion: 该框架为3D场景建模提供了新方向，并展示了多模态对齐的潜力。

Abstract: Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in
assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating

language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive
models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a
unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a
detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal
training and performance addressing key questions related to data
representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance
across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and
question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend
our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D
modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTV是一个用于音频同步视频生成的框架，通过分离音频轨道实现精细控制，并引入DEMIX数据集支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频与视频的自然同步性使其成为视频生成的重要控制信号，但现有方法在复杂音频类型下表现不佳。

Method: MTV框架将音频分为语音、效果和音乐轨道，分别控制唇部动作、事件时间和视觉氛围，并利用DEMIX数据集进行多阶段训练。

Result: MTV在视频质量、文本-视频一致性和音频-视频对齐等六个标准指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MTV通过音频分离和多阶段训练实现了高质量的音频同步视频生成。

Abstract: Audio is inherently temporal and closely synchronized with the visual world,
making it a naturally aligned and expressive control signal for controllable
video generation (e.g., movies). Beyond control, directly translating audio
into video is essential for understanding and visualizing rich audio narratives
(e.g., Podcasts or historical recordings). However, existing approaches fall
short in generating high-quality videos with precise audio-visual
synchronization, especially across diverse and complex audio types. In this
work, we introduce MTV, a versatile framework for audio-sync video generation.
MTV explicitly separates audios into speech, effects, and music tracks,
enabling disentangled control over lip motion, event timing, and visual mood,
respectively -- resulting in fine-grained and semantically aligned video
generation. To support the framework, we additionally present DEMIX, a dataset
comprising high-quality cinematic videos and demixed audio tracks. DEMIX is
structured into five overlapped subsets, enabling scalable multi-stage training
for diverse generation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV
achieves state-of-the-art performance across six standard metrics spanning
video quality, text-video consistency, and audio-video alignment. Project page:

Method: 引入K阶递归噪声表示解决零终端信噪比调度问题，并提出随机潜在调制以合成新可见区域。

Result: 实验表明，通过噪声初始化阶段的结构化潜在操作，可以有效实现动态视图合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的情况下实现了高质量的动态视图合成，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an
inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise
initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable
high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary
modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic
inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and
resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order
Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this
representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the
VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions
resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which
performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded
regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can
be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise
initialization phase.

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和Argoverse 2等基准测试中，性能提升超过30%。

Conclusion: ZeroVO无需微调或相机校准，为实际大规模部署提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves
zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming
limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera
calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we
design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling
noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a
language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust
feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we
develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts
to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to
generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous
driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on
three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly
introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto
(GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens
the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world
deployment at scale.

Result: 实验显示Dreamland在图像质量上提升50.8%，可控性增强17.9%，并有助于AI代理训练。

Conclusion: Dreamland通过分层抽象和混合框架显著提升了生成模型的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic
visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise
controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI
agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the
granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content
output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a
layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level
semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the
simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability,
minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world
distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained
generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the
training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate
that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image
quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance
embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在整合视觉与语言信息方面的能力，并诊断其失败模式。

Method: 通过一系列视觉中心基准测试（如深度估计、对应关系）比较VLMs与视觉编码器的表现，并分析模型各部分的性能瓶颈。

Result: VLMs在视觉任务中表现接近随机水平，远低于视觉编码器，主要瓶颈在于未能有效利用视觉信息。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉任务中的表现受限于语言模型的先验知识，未来研究需改进视觉信息的整合方式。

Abstract: Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on
visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must
successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares
VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability
to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric
benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform
substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance
performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across
the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2)
brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the
task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies
in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information
easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language
priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of
open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future
investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.

Conclusion: Self Forcing在视频生成质量和效率上均表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video
diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where
models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on
their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise
future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions
each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing
autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This
strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that
directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than
relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training
efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic
gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and
performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables
efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second
latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation
quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models. Project

Motivation: 高范数令牌会导致注意力图噪声，影响视觉处理性能，现有解决方案需要重新训练模型，作者希望找到一种无需训练的方法。

Method: 通过将高范数激活从特定神经元转移到额外的未训练令牌，模拟注册令牌的效果，无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: 测试时注册令牌可有效替代显式训练的注册令牌，为未预训练注册令牌的模型提供了一种无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in
Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy
attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a
sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on
outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading
downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these
outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned
register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to
mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our
discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic
the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We
demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps,
enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks,
and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register
tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language
models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time
registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time,
offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without
them.

Abstract: Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature
suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a
novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs
develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing
arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM
via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake,
significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks
like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any
worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of
transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist
models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a
challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new
post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable
and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning
abilities in MLLMs.

Conclusion: StableMTL展示了在零样本设置下利用扩散模型进行多任务学习的潜力，并通过任务注意力机制实现了任务间的有效共享。

Abstract: Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive
annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with
partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models,
we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a
multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset
of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent
regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task
conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses
requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling
seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a
multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task
interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task
sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景重建通常需要优化方法，耗时且难以扩展。4DGT旨在通过纯前馈推理减少重建时间，同时保持高精度。

Method: 使用4D高斯作为归纳偏置，结合密度控制策略处理长时空输入，以滚动窗口方式预测场景中的4D高斯。

Result: 4DGT在真实视频中显著优于其他高斯网络，在跨域视频中与优化方法精度相当，重建时间从小时级降至秒级。

Conclusion: 4DGT通过高效前馈推理和统一建模，为动态场景重建提供了快速且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene
reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D
Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components,
enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object
lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which
enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient
rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a
rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike
optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference,
reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to
long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video
datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in
real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods
on cross-domain videos. Project page: https://4dgt.github.io

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化框架，设计了两种新的水印方法（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），用于在低熵任务中高效检测LLM生成文本的水印，同时最小化对文本质量的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM水印在低熵任务（如代码生成）中检测困难的问题，同时平衡检测准确性和文本质量。

Method: 提出优化框架，设计两种可调水印（HeavyWater和SimplexWater），通过随机侧信息最大化检测概率并最小化文本失真。

Result: 实验表明，两种水印在低熵任务中能高效检测且对文本质量影响小，并揭示了水印与编码理论的新联系。

Conclusion: HeavyWater和SimplexWater为LLM水印提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于低熵任务。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text
provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI
systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions
output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random
side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.
LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -
such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this
paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is
to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to
maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of
generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:
HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully
trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be
applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine
the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,
demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with
minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy
regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections
between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be
found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

*Xiaoyuan Zhu,Yaowen Ye,Tianyi Qiu,Hanlin Zhu,Sijun Tan,Ajraf Mannan,Jonathan Michala,Raluca Ada Popa,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于排名的均匀性测试方法，用于验证黑盒大语言模型（LLM）与本地部署的真实模型的行为一致性，解决了API提供商可能暗中替换模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: API提供商可能为了降低成本或恶意修改模型行为，暗中提供量化或微调的变体，影响性能和安全性，而用户缺乏透明度和检测手段。

Method: 采用基于排名的均匀性测试，无需模型权重或输出logits，高效且不易被检测。

Result: 在量化、有害微调、越狱提示和完整模型替换等多种威胁场景下，该方法在有限查询预算下表现出优越的统计功效。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测黑盒LLM的行为差异，对抗性提供商难以规避，具有实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As API access becomes a primary interface to large language models (LLMs),
users often interact with black-box systems that offer little transparency into
the deployed model. To reduce costs or maliciously alter model behaviors, API
providers may discreetly serve quantized or fine-tuned variants, which can
degrade performance and compromise safety. Detecting such substitutions is
difficult, as users lack access to model weights and, in most cases, even
output logits. To tackle this problem, we propose a rank-based uniformity test
that can verify the behavioral equality of a black-box LLM to a locally
deployed authentic model. Our method is accurate, query-efficient, and avoids
detectable query patterns, making it robust to adversarial providers that
reroute or mix responses upon the detection of testing attempts. We evaluate
the approach across diverse threat scenarios, including quantization, harmful
fine-tuning, jailbreak prompts, and full model substitution, showing that it
consistently achieves superior statistical power over prior methods under
constrained query budgets.

TL;DR: 论文提出HauntAttack框架，揭示大型推理模型在安全性与推理能力之间的权衡问题，实验表明即使最先进的模型也存在显著安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理能力增强时暴露的安全隐患，特别是当推理与有害性紧密关联时的安全-推理权衡问题。

Method: 提出HauntAttack框架，通过将有害指令嵌入推理问题中，逐步引导模型生成不安全输出。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进的LRMs也存在显著安全漏洞，并对不同模型、有害指令类型及输出模式进行了详细分析。

Conclusion: HauntAttack揭示了LRMs的安全脆弱性，为模型安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and
reasoning tasks, showcasing exceptional capabilities. However, the enhancement
of reasoning abilities and the exposure of their internal reasoning processes
introduce new safety vulnerabilities. One intriguing concern is: when reasoning
is strongly entangled with harmfulness, what safety-reasoning trade-off do LRMs
exhibit? To address this issue, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and
general-purpose black-box attack framework that systematically embeds harmful
instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we treat reasoning
questions as carriers and substitute one of their original conditions with a
harmful instruction. This process creates a reasoning pathway in which the
model is guided step by step toward generating unsafe outputs. Based on
HauntAttack, we conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple LRMs. Our results
reveal that even the most advanced LRMs exhibit significant safety
vulnerabilities. Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of different
models, various types of harmful instructions, and model output patterns,
providing valuable insights into the security of LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLMs在看似无害输入下可能产生隐性危害，提出JailFlipBench基准和攻击方法，呼吁更广泛的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在隐性危害（Implicit Harm）上的风险，填补传统越狱攻击（jailbreak）忽视的领域。

Method: 通过结构化象限分析LLM风险，提出JailFlipBench基准和攻击方法，评估多模态和事实扩展场景。

Result: 发现隐性危害对现实世界构成紧迫风险，多种LLMs均存在此类问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁扩展LLM安全评估范围，超越传统越狱攻击范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about their security. While jailbreak attacks
highlight failures under overtly harmful queries, they overlook a critical
risk: incorrectly answering harmless-looking inputs can be dangerous and cause
real-world harm (Implicit Harm). We systematically reformulate the LLM risk
landscape through a structured quadrant perspective based on output factuality
and input harmlessness, uncovering an overlooked high-risk region. To
investigate this gap, we propose JailFlipBench, a benchmark aims to capture
implicit harm, spanning single-modal, multimodal, and factual extension
scenarios with diverse evaluation metrics. We further develop initial JailFlip
attack methodologies and conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple
open-source and black-box LLMs, show that implicit harm present immediate and
urgent real-world risks, calling for broader LLM safety assessments and
alignment beyond conventional jailbreak paradigms.

TL;DR: DISRetrieval是一种基于语言话语结构的层次检索框架，通过利用修辞结构理论（RST）和自适应摘要技术，显著提升了长文档理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能捕捉文档的固有话语结构，限制了长文档理解的效果。DISRetrieval旨在通过引入话语结构来解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 使用RST构建句子级层次表示；2. 结合自适应摘要增强节点表示；3. 设计层次证据检索机制。

Result: 在QASPER和QuALITY数据集上，DISRetrieval在检索指标和问答任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 话语结构的引入显著提升了检索效果，验证了语言信息在长文本理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural
language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising
solution to address the context length limitations of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences
or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent
discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a
novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse
structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that
utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level
hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and
natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that
combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes
with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval
mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse
coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,
DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in
both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our
ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly
enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query
types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document
representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly
available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对航空事故数据模式的理解，以支持航空安全决策。

Method: 使用36,000+份NTSB报告，BERTopic基于Transformer嵌入和层次聚类，PLSA基于EM算法的概率建模。

Result: BERTopic在主题连贯性（Cv得分0.41 vs. PLSA 0.37）和可解释性上优于PLSA。

Conclusion: 现代Transformer方法在复杂航空数据分析中更具优势，未来将探索混合模型和多语言数据集。

Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent
Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety
reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident
data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based
embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic
modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed
that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of
0.41 compared to PLSA 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability
as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the
advantages of modern transformer based approaches in analyzing complex aviation
datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in
aviation safety. Future work will explore hybrid models, multilingual datasets,
and advanced clustering techniques to further improve topic modelling in this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在金融领域的实际应用存在性能不足和资源消耗高的问题，尤其是在判别任务、生成任务和主题建模方面。

Method: 提出了FinBERT2，一个基于32b金融语料库预训练的双向编码器，并开发了Fin-Labelers、Fin-Retrievers和Fin-TopicModel等变体。

Result: FinBERT2在金融分类任务中优于其他BERT变体和LLMs，在检索任务中超越开源和专有嵌入器，并在主题建模中表现优异。

Conclusion: FinBERT2为金融领域的LLMs应用提供了高效解决方案，重新审视了BERT模型在LLMs时代的作用。

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only
tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such
as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has
revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT
on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources,
such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on
generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods
to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing
suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are
additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic
modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained
on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the
largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter
size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the
financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1)
Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT
variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five
financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models
(Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over
BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3)
Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables
superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work
revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary
LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the
LLMs era.

Motivation: 优化阿拉伯语RAG组件，填补高资源语言与阿拉伯语之间的研究空白。

Method: 使用RAGAS框架，评估分块策略、嵌入模型、重排器和语言模型在阿拉伯语数据集上的表现。

Result: 句子感知分块效果最佳，BGE-M3和Multilingual-E5-large嵌入模型表现最优，重排器显著提升复杂数据集忠实度，Aya-8B生成质量优于StableLM。

Conclusion: 研究为构建高质量阿拉伯语RAG管道提供了关键见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture
for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large
language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for
high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains
underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of
state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding
models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets.
Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four
core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and
answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking
outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and
Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The
inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness
in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These
findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG
pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components
across different document types.

Conclusion: LlamaRec-LKG-RAG证明了结构化推理在基于LLM的推荐中的重要性，为下一代推荐系统提供了可扩展的知识感知个性化基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in
recommender systems through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks.
However, existing RAG approaches predominantly rely on flat, similarity-based
retrieval that fails to leverage the rich relational structure inherent in
user-item interactions. We introduce LlamaRec-LKG-RAG, a novel single-pass,
end-to-end trainable framework that integrates personalized knowledge graph
context into LLM-based recommendation ranking. Our approach extends the
LlamaRec architecture by incorporating a lightweight user preference module
that dynamically identifies salient relation paths within a heterogeneous
knowledge graph constructed from user behavior and item metadata. These
personalized subgraphs are seamlessly integrated into prompts for a fine-tuned
Llama-2 model, enabling efficient and interpretable recommendations through a
unified inference step. Comprehensive experiments on ML-100K and Amazon Beauty
datasets demonstrate consistent and significant improvements over LlamaRec
across key ranking metrics (MRR, NDCG, Recall). LlamaRec-LKG-RAG demonstrates
the critical value of structured reasoning in LLM-based recommendations and
establishes a foundation for scalable, knowledge-aware personalization in
next-generation recommender systems. Code is available

Abstract: We present HotelMatch-LLM, a multimodal dense retrieval model for the travel
domain that enables natural language property search, addressing the
limitations of traditional travel search engines which require users to start
with a destination and editing search parameters. HotelMatch-LLM features three
key innovations: (1) Domain-specific multi-task optimization with three novel
retrieval, visual, and language modeling objectives; (2) Asymmetrical dense
retrieval architecture combining a small language model (SLM) for efficient
online query processing and a large language model (LLM) for embedding hotel

Conclusion: GLProtein通过整合全局和局部结构信息，为蛋白质功能预测提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的自回归模型（ARMs）加速技术不适用于dLLMs，因为其双向注意力机制导致高推理延迟。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出dLLM-Cache框架，结合长间隔提示缓存和基于特征相似性的部分响应更新，实现高效中间计算重用。

Result: 在LLaDA 8B和Dream 7B等代表性dLLMs上，dLLM-Cache实现了最高9.1倍的加速，且不损失输出质量。

Conclusion: dLLM-Cache显著降低了dLLMs的推理延迟，使其接近ARMs的水平，为dLLMs的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large
Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of
diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by
iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant
advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.
Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are
incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To
address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that
dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where
most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we
propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines
long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature
similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations
without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative
dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1
x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably,
our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many
settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released
publicly on GitHub.

the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current
round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.
At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context
consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality
of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM
is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like
an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,
creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance
improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.
Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM
itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,
offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过动态模型选择和分层推理策略来优化语言模型的计算效率，以应对资源受限环境中的部署挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在计算和能源消耗方面的高成本限制了其在移动、边缘或成本敏感环境中的部署。

Method: 论文提出了两种策略：(i) 路由策略，根据查询选择最合适的模型；(ii) 分层推理（HI），通过模型序列逐步处理查询。

Result: 这些策略通过减少对大型模型的使用，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了任务性能。

Conclusion: 论文总结了现有方法的优缺点，并提出了未来研究方向，以进一步提升语言模型在现实应用中的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field
of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation,
summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains
computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with
limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in
mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges,
recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection
strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query
complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to
larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary
strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most
suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference
(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident
response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using
lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We
provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance
metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we
outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive
model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across
heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and
accessible for real world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为E2H Reasoner的方法，通过从易到难的任务调度（E2H）提升语言模型的推理能力，避免过拟合并减少样本需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，仅用强化学习（RL）难以有效提升语言模型在复杂任务上的推理能力，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用从易到难的任务调度（E2H），结合课程学习，逐步构建模型的推理能力，并通过适当的调度避免过拟合。

Result: 实验表明，E2H Reasoner显著提升了小型语言模型（1.5B至3B）的推理能力，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: E2H Reasoner是一种有效的提升语言模型推理能力的方法，尤其适用于小型模型。

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via
reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1
have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks.
However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on
inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from
curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H),
allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H
Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important
initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in
preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for
E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive
finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately
decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer
total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show
that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs
(1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决上下文学习中示例选择和顺序对效果敏感的问题。

Method: 提出MarginSel，通过两步法选择困难示例，适应每个测试实例。

Conclusion: MarginSel通过增加困难示例的边际，优化了LLM的决策边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context
learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present
MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that
selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test
instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across
classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also
provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel
induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for
hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision
boundary in a beneficial direction.

Result: 实验表明GAGA仅需1%标注数据即可达到或超越现有方法分类精度。

Conclusion: GAGA高效且成本低，适用于TAG表示学习。

Abstract: In the realm of Text-attributed Graphs (TAGs), traditional graph neural
networks (GNNs) often fall short due to the complex textual information
associated with each node. Recent methods have improved node representations by
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance node text features, but
these approaches typically require extensive annotations or fine-tuning across
all nodes, which is both time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce GAGA, an efficient framework for TAG representation
learning. GAGA reduces annotation time and cost by focusing on annotating only
representative nodes and edges. It constructs an annotation graph that captures
the topological relationships among these annotations. Furthermore, GAGA
employs a two-level alignment module to effectively integrate the annotation
graph with the TAG, aligning their underlying structures. Experiments show that
GAGA achieves classification accuracies on par with or surpassing
state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 1% of the data to be annotated,
demonstrating its high efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，特定风格提示（如列表格式）会增加大型语言模型（LLM）对越狱攻击的脆弱性，攻击成功率（ASR）显著上升。SafeStyle防御策略通过匹配风格分布的安全训练数据，有效提升了模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨风格提示是否影响LLM安全性，以及如何通过风格对齐和防御策略降低风险。

Method: 评估32个LLM在7个越狱基准测试中的表现，分析风格模式长度与注意力相关性，并提出SafeStyle防御策略。

Result: 风格提示显著提高ASR，风格对齐增加模型脆弱性；SafeStyle在多种风格设置下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 风格提示对LLM安全性有负面影响，SafeStyle是一种有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these
style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind
jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek
to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial
style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these
risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,
and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success
rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both
the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on
them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that
fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of
those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that
incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the
distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and
five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines
in maintaining LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型安全对齐是反应式的，攻击者和防御者之间存在滞后性，无法动态应对新兴威胁。

Method: 采用两玩家零和博弈框架，模型在攻击者和防御者角色间切换，通过奖励模型裁决结果，实现动态协同进化。

Result: 实验表明，Self-RedTeam能发现更多样化的攻击（+21.8% SBERT），并在安全基准测试中表现更优（如WildJailBreak上+65.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究提倡从被动修补转向主动协同进化，通过多智能体强化学习实现语言模型的自主、鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

Motivation: 解决链式模型（CoM）中因因果掩码导致的长距离依赖丢失问题，提升模型对全局上下文的理解能力。

Method: 提出GoCE方法，将隐式令牌表示映射为可微分稀疏因果邻接矩阵，结合因果掩码注意力和因果-MoE，并通过干预一致性损失测试和自演化门实现动态平衡。

Result: GoCE在公开数据集（CLUTRR、CLADDER等）上表现优于基线LLMs，显著提升了长距离因果依赖捕捉和自演化能力。

Conclusion: GoCE不仅优于CoM设计，还为未来因果学习和持续自适应改进研究提供了经验。

Abstract: In view of the problem that each subchain in the chain-of-model (CoM) relies
only on the information of the previous subchain and may lose long-range
dependencies due to the causal mask blocking the global context flow between
multi-level subchains, this work proposes a graph of causal evolution (GoCE).
Its core principle is to map the implicit token representation into a
differentiable and sparse causal adjacency matrix, then permeate causal
constraints through each layer of calculation using causal-masked attention and
causal-MoE. By combining intervention consistency loss test and self-evolution
gate, the dynamic balance between causal structure learning and adaptive
updating of transformer architecture is realized. The researcher built
experimental environments in sandboxes built with Claude Sonnet 4,
o4-mini-high, and DeepSeek R1 respectively with the transformer variant
architecture introduced in GoCE. It is evaluated on publicly available datasets
including CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA and compared with the
baseline LLMs. The finding proves that GoCE strengthens the transformer's
ability to capture long-range causal dependencies, while the ability to
self-evolve is improved. It not only surpasses the design of CoM in terms of
design principles, but also provides experience for future research on causal
learning and continuous adaptive improvement.

that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks,
offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效且具有可解释性，适用于下游因果推断研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first practical algorithms with provable
guarantees for the problem of inferring the topics assigned to each document in
an LDA topic model. This is the primary inference problem for many applications
of topic models in social science, data exploration, and causal inference
settings. We obtain this result by showing a novel non-gradient-based,
combinatorial approach to estimating topic models. This yields algorithms that
converge to near-optimal posterior probability in logarithmic parallel
computation time (adaptivity) -- exponentially faster than any known LDA
algorithm. We also show that our approach can provide interpretability
guarantees such that each learned topic is formally associated with a known
keyword. Finally, we show that unlike alternatives, our approach can maintain
the independence assumptions necessary to use the learned topic model for
downstream causal inference methods that allow researchers to study topics as
treatments. In terms of practical performance, our approach consistently
returns solutions of higher semantic quality than solutions from
state-of-the-art LDA algorithms, neural topic models, and LLM-based topic
models across a diverse range of text datasets and evaluation parameters.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）通过单标记预测学习，限制了其对连贯高层次概念的理解能力，阻碍了真正智能系统的发展。

Method: 引入Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT)，一种多标记训练方法，使模型能够学习跨多个标记的序列，从而增强概念感知能力。

Result: 实验表明，CAFT在文本摘要和蛋白质设计等任务中显著优于传统方法，并将多标记预测从昂贵的预训练阶段扩展到后训练阶段。

Conclusion: CAFT不仅提升了模型性能，还为机器学习社区提供了更广泛的研究启示，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.
However, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits
their ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical
barrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase "ribonucleic
acid" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,
artificial text fragments ("rib", "on", ...), then learn each token
sequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic
entity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding
and, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we
introduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method
that redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences
that span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.
Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional
next-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional
applications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo
protein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the
prohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first
to bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively
democratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and
researchers. Finally, the unexpected effectiveness of our proposed method
suggests wider implications for the machine learning research community. All

Conclusion: 为选择性引入非线性提供了原则性框架，连接动力学系统理论与循环网络的功能需求。

Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence
modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting,
speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been
viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that
linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance
comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in
recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and
what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
(AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a
flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory.
Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus
selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but
often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more
interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results
provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity,
bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range
memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with
implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.

Result: 即使顶级模型QYI得分仅0.6，远低于专家基准1，暴露了工具使用、规划和自适应推理的局限性。

Conclusion: HeuriGym为LLMs在科学和工程领域的实际问题解决提供了更有效的评估基准。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in

Motivation: 高内涵筛选（HCS）技术（如Cell Painting）能大规模研究细胞形态对扰动的响应，但现有方法难以处理其与自然图像的语义差异及扰动类型的多样性。

Method: CellCLIP结合预训练图像编码器、新型通道编码方案和自然语言编码器，学习统一的潜在空间，对齐扰动与其形态效应。

Result: CellCLIP在跨模态检索和下游任务中表现最佳，同时显著减少计算时间。

Conclusion: CellCLIP为HCS数据提供了一种高效的跨模态对比学习解决方案，推动了细胞形态与扰动关系的研究。

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy
techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells'
morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The
collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the
relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular
state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive
learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that
aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However,
the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to
substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to
natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of
perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent
space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a
cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages
pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to
better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image
embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing
perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models,
demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and
biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant
reductions in computation time.

entropy in visual embedding space. NeurNCD also integrates several key
components, including feature query, feature modulation and clustering,
facilitating efficient feature augmentation and information exchange between
the pre-trained semantic segmentation network and implicit neural
representations. As a result, our framework achieves superior segmentation
performance in both open and closed-world settings without relying on densely
labelled datasets for supervised training or human interaction to generate
sparse label supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the NYUv2 and Replica
datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum machine learning have shown promise in
enhancing classical neural network architectures, particularly in domains
involving complex, high-dimensional data. Building upon prior work in temporal
sequence modeling, this paper introduces Vision-QRWKV, a hybrid
quantum-classical extension of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV)
architecture, applied for the first time to image classification tasks. By
integrating a variational quantum circuit (VQC) into the channel mixing
component of RWKV, our model aims to improve nonlinear feature transformation
and enhance the expressive capacity of visual representations.
  We evaluate both classical and quantum RWKV models on a diverse collection of
14 medical and standard image classification benchmarks, including MedMNIST
datasets, MNIST, and FashionMNIST. Our results demonstrate that the
quantum-enhanced model outperforms its classical counterpart on a majority of
datasets, particularly those with subtle or noisy class distinctions (e.g.,
ChestMNIST, RetinaMNIST, BloodMNIST). This study represents the first
systematic application of quantum-enhanced RWKV in the visual domain, offering
insights into the architectural trade-offs and future potential of quantum
models for lightweight and efficient vision tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合图像负载特征和持续学习的非侵入式负载监测方法，显著提高了识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非侵入式负载监测方法因负载组合和应用环境复杂多变，存在特征鲁棒性差和模型泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 将多维电力信号转换为图像负载特征，结合深度卷积神经网络进行设备识别分类，并引入自监督预训练和持续在线学习策略。

Result: 在高采样率负载数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别精度上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图像特征和持续学习策略，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，为智能电力管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and
energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the
electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power
management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and
application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and
insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end,
this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates
"image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts
multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into
visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural
networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices;
at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature
generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome
model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a
large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a
variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the
proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过模型编辑技术增强低资源语言识别能力的新方法，显著提升了模型在新字母表和域外数据上的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如古代手稿和非西方语言）在识别系统中代表性不足的问题，提升模型在新数据分布上的泛化能力。

Method: 利用模型编辑技术，结合域合并策略，避免传统元学习对原型或整体分布的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相同训练数据下显著提升了新字母表的迁移学习和域外评估性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建能够快速适应低资源字母表的模型提供了新思路，扩展了文档识别的应用范围。

Abstract: Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial
for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed,
low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages,
tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational
techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building
models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets,
faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage
of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of
unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art
meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse
distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall
distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact
training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in
\textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain
evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts
and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building
models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable
document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试域分布偏移时性能下降，影响用户体验，现有TTA方法难以应对动态多测试分布。

Method: 提出FIND方法，包含LFD、FABN和S-FABN三个组件，分别用于特征解耦、特征感知批归一化和选择性特征分区。

Result: 实验表明FIND显著优于现有方法，动态场景下准确率提升30%，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: FIND通过特征解耦和动态归一化策略，有效解决了动态多测试分布问题，提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines
under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a
substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test
distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across
different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means
and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global
normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data
characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance
Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise
Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and
Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar
distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN
optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific
statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which
layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby
enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy
improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在任务中表现优异，但大模型尺寸导致推理延迟问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用对抗训练方法（FREE），每个退出点包含一个Transformer层和分类器，通过GAN框架训练特征表示与最终层相似。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持性能的同时，推理速度提升1.51倍以上，并增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FREE方法有效解决了VLMs的推理延迟问题，同时减少了过度思考和中间危机现象。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
performance improvements in Vision-Language tasks. However, their large size
poses challenges for real-world applications where inference latency is a
concern. To tackle this issue, we propose employing Early Exit (EE) strategies
in VLMs. However, training exit classifiers in VLMs is challenging,
particularly with limited labeled training data. To address this, we introduce
FREE, an adversarial training approach within a GAN-based framework. Here, each
exit consists of a transformer layer and a classifier. The transformer layer is
adversarially trained to produce feature representations similar to the final
layer, while a feature classifier serves as the discriminator. Our method
focuses on performing input-adaptive inference that increases inference speed
with minimal drop in performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing accuracy and model robustness by
mitigating overthinking and the phenomenon of mid-crisis that we highlight. We
experimentally validate that our method speeds up the inference process by more
than 1.51x while retaining comparable performance. The source code is available

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法假设所有查询成本相同，而实际中某些查询可能成本更高（如触发额外审查的查询），但针对非对称成本场景的有效算法仍不完善。

Method: 提出了非对称搜索（AS）和非对称梯度估计（AGREST），通过减少对高成本查询的依赖并调整采样分布以偏向低成本查询，设计高效算法平衡不同查询类型。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在不同成本机制下均显著降低了总查询成本和扰动大小，某些场景下改进幅度高达40%。

Conclusion: 本文提出的非对称黑盒攻击框架能有效降低攻击成本，并可无缝集成到现有黑盒攻击方法中，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers
aim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while
keeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input
to the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all
queries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric
costs; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may
trigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly
than others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,
effective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we
propose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query
costs, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core
components of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation
process. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative
variant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and
Asymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution
to favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total
attack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods
such as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)
queries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box
attacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across
various cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost
and smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to
40% in some settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决国际水域非法活动（如非法捕鱼和石油走私）中GPS欺骗轨迹检测的挑战，尤其是面对AI生成的虚假轨迹和缺乏标记数据的问题。

Method: 提出了一种物理信息扩散模型，结合运动学约束来识别不符合物理规律的轨迹。

Result: 在真实数据集（海事和城市领域）上验证了模型的高预测准确性和低误差率。

Conclusion: 该方法在异常检测和轨迹生成方面优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined
threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS
spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb
illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and
illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI
generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories)
and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification.
Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection
using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider
fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting
in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a
physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to
identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results
on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed
framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate
for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our
implementation is available at

Method: 提出Perception-R1，通过视觉感知奖励激励模型准确感知视觉内容，并利用标注文本和LLM评估一致性。

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中表现优异，仅用1,442训练数据即达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Perception-R1有效提升了MLLMs的多模态感知与推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in
the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the
reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the
enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a
core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning.
Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively
enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their
further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we
propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that
explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby
can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from
the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual
references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM
to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses
generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these
consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Motivation: 现有对比学习存在嵌入分布无显式调控和过度依赖负样本的问题，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出VarCon，将监督对比学习重新表述为对潜在类变量的变分推理，最大化后验加权的ELBO，实现高效类感知匹配和嵌入空间内类内分散的精细控制。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上达到SOTA性能（如ImageNet-1K上79.36% Top-1准确率），并展现更清晰的决策边界和语义组织。

Conclusion: VarCon显著提升了对比学习的性能和泛化能力，适用于少样本学习和多种增强策略。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in
shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar
samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key
limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding
distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart
unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance
on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization.
To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive
Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as
variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a
posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive
pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants
fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space.
Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while
converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision
boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by
KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning
assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning
than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation
strategies.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models
into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a
crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications.
Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models
integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress
in representation learning. However, current methods still have some
limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information,
which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware
and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding
approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological
structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational
nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we
introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations
through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and
dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language
models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural
architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified
semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot
prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we
propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures,
resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP
benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA
while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction
capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the
cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.

approach resolves spatial ambiguities, provides theoretical guarantees for

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including
preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness
to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit
semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they
struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models
present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having
demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and
representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of
diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic
and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic
representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to
edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for
diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables
principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity
preservation.

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态数据生成提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
unimodal data across various tasks, including image, video, and text
generation. On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through
diffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing
approaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers
and variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a
unified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of
encoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited
data. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building
multimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native
generation of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an
innovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both
unconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model
simultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation
and mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves
competitive performance.

Abstract: Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have
recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These
approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to
generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,
we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model
weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during
training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely
by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple
interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform
simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight
ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We
further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by
modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image
diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a
realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model,
and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new
domains. Our code is available at

Conclusion: CER证明了通过动态记忆缓冲区积累经验的有效性，显著提升了语言模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential
decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any
environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks.
Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past
experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain
these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual
Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient
self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER
accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer.
These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making
patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant
knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments.
We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On
VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena,
CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving
the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a
comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand
it better.

### [367] [Cross-Entropy Games for Language Models: From Implicit Knowledge to General Capability Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06832)
*Clément Hongler,Andrew Emil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）概率测量的任务框架，称为交叉熵（Xent）游戏，用于评估LLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何通过概率测量表达知识，并设计超越生成采样的任务，以更全面地评估其能力。

Method: 提出Xent游戏框架，包括单人和多人游戏，基于交叉熵分数和约束，并通过计算图和程序实现。

Result: Xent游戏空间足够丰富，包含多种有趣示例，并能通过基本博弈论一致性公理构建。

Conclusion: Xent游戏可作为LLMs能力的基准，通过进化动力学方法探索其空间，解决通用能力测量的无界范围问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By
considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know
such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to
formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms
of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality
search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be
formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)
Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve
cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as
simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large
enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible
from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game
space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the
construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be
used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a
covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the
challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of
Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary
dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种元学习方法，通过蒸馏任务相关图像特征生成软提示，以提升小型LMM在少样本任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型LMM在ICL中性能不一致的问题，避免因图像嵌入中无关信息干扰任务表现。

Method: 引入注意力映射模块与软提示联合学习，结合LLaVA v1.5架构，实现少样本任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上表现优于ICL和其他提示调优方法，尤其在图像扰动下仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LMM在少样本任务中的适应性和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Motivation: 当前对LRMs的评估主要关注最终答案准确性，缺乏对其推理过程的深入理解，因此需要系统研究其能力和限制。

Method: 使用可控的谜题环境，精确操纵复杂性并分析推理痕迹，比较LRMs与标准LLMs在不同复杂度任务中的表现。

Conclusion: LRMs在精确计算和一致性推理方面存在局限性，需进一步研究其推理能力。

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers.
While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks,
their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain
insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established
math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this
evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide
insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate
these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise
manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures.
This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal
reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive
experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain
complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their
reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines
despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard
LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance
regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2)
medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3)
high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that
LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit
algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the
reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and
analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their
strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在行为幻觉问题，影响可靠性和扩展性，而现有研究主要关注客观幻觉，行为幻觉研究较少。

Method: 提出SHE框架：1) 通过自适应时间窗口检测幻觉；2) 通过正交投影缓解幻觉。同时提出BEACH指标。

Result: SHE在标准基准测试中将行为幻觉减少10%以上，同时保持描述准确性。

Conclusion: SHE框架有效填补行为幻觉研究空白，提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still
suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for
broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly
focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides
objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less
studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral
hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the
snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence
Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects
hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive
temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint
embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral
hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while
maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Motivation: 当前代理框架在安全信息流、可靠性和多代理协调方面缺乏原则性机制，SAFEFLOW旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAFEFLOW通过信息流控制（IFC）、事务执行、冲突解决和安全调度等技术，确保数据的安全性和一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SAFEFLOW在对抗性和并发条件下显著优于现有技术，同时保持任务性能和安全性。

Conclusion: SAFEFLOW为构建安全、可靠的代理生态系统奠定了基础，推动了可靠自治的前沿。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models
(VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and
multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent
frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information
flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce
SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based
agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC),
precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data
exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM
reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or
adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure
robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces
transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared
state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce
mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that
further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To
validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and
concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security
guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming
state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for
principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of
reliable autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代LLMs是否能解决传统符号AI无法解决的框架问题和符号接地问题。

Method: 设计了两个基准任务，在零样本条件下对13种LLMs进行测试，评估其输出质量。

Result: 开源模型表现不一，而部分闭源模型表现稳定且高分，表明某些LLMs可能具备解决这些问题的能力。

Conclusion: 现代LLMs可能已具备解决长期理论挑战的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized
philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most
fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding
Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional
symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the
cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed
two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem,
administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed
and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five
trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including
contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The
results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in
performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction
tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings
suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to
produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical
challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出LUCIFER框架，结合强化学习和大型语言模型，利用人类上下文知识提升自主决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中，现有环境知识的快速过时导致自主决策效率低下，需整合人类实时观察的上下文知识。

Method: LUCIFER框架采用分层决策架构，结合强化学习和大型语言模型，将人类输入转化为可执行信息。

Result: 实验表明LUCIFER优于传统策略，显著提升探索效率和决策质量。

Conclusion: LUCIFER展示了上下文驱动决策的潜力，为自主系统整合人类知识提供了新方向。

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental
knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving
reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated
environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous
decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain
stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time
observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and
context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains
an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding
and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a
domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making
architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)
into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex
tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each
focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike
traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER
integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring
verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence
decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived
insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration
facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.
We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves
exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,
goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven
decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge
for operational success.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集稀缺、合成或过于形式化，阻碍了不等式证明领域的发展，因此需要一种新的任务设计和数据集。

Method: 将不等式证明分为两个可自动检查的子任务：边界估计和关系预测，并开发了LLM-as-judge评估框架。

Result: 评估29个领先LLM发现，即使顶级模型在逐步审查下准确率低于10%，暴露了推理链的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 模型规模和计算资源增加对证明正确性提升有限，未来研究方向包括定理引导推理和自我优化。

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical
fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and
strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for
large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical
problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that
are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an
informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two
automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction.
Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of
Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched
with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel
LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four
step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic
evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even
top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise
scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only
final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and
a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and
constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time
computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our
findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided
reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在图像-文本对齐上表现不佳，且现有方法依赖外部监督，仅解决单向任务。

Method: 提出自监督双奖励机制，通过采样多输出并计算逆对偶似然作为自奖励进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型性能，尤其在文本到图像任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 自监督双奖励机制有效增强了多模态模型的理解与生成能力，无需外部监督。

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models
(LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework.
However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to
generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow
the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision
(e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional
tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the
observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we
introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the
understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample
multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the
input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards
for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the
performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving
remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话AI基准测试仅模拟单控制环境，用户被动提供信息，而真实场景（如技术支持）需要用户主动参与修改共享世界状态。

Method: 1) 提出Telecom双控制领域，建模为Dec-POMDP；2) 任务生成器从原子组件创建多样化任务；3) 可靠用户模拟器；4) 细粒度性能分析。

Result: 实验显示，从无用户到双控制时，AI性能显著下降，突显指导用户的挑战。

Conclusion: τ²-bench为需有效推理和指导用户行为的AI提供了可控测试平台。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control
environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world,
while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from
real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively
participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address
this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both
agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that
tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse,
verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and
controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose
behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation
fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations
including separating errors arising from reasoning vs
communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents
shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding
users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that
must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Conclusion: VisioMath为未来多模态推理研究提供了严格的测试基准，推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform
mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an
essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical
reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices.
VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where
each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs.
To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically
tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where
fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate
problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath
and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably,
GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current
models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a
crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed
for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known
classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show
effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions.
However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the
effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed
distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a
learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased
classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive
discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process
encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on
public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in
revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing
GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories,
thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates
self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal
GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training,
offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning.
GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated
data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation.
Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically
construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful
trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI
understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and
evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a
diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of
GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection
tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to
continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our
framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities,
paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with
all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations.
While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times
misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of
malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate
communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with
round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots
consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression
or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of
institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly
vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses --
always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity
swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side
"AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized
persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking;

*Lingyao Li,Dawei Li,Zhenhui Ou,Xiaoran Xu,Jingxiao Liu,Zihui Ma,Runlong Yu,Min Deng*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和多模态数据模拟地震感知影响，生成修正麦加利烈度（MMI）预测，结果显示与实际报告高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高对突发性灾害（如地震）的主动准备能力，通过模拟复杂场景增强预事件规划。

Method: 结合多模态数据集（地理空间、社会经济、建筑和街景图像数据），利用LLMs生成MMI预测，并采用RAG和ICL技术优化性能。

Result: 在2014年纳帕和2019年里奇克莱斯特地震中，预测与实际报告高度相关（0.88），RMSE较低（0.77）。视觉输入显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟灾害影响方面具有潜力，有助于加强灾害前的规划准备。

Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for
sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex
scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived
earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial,
socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates
Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales.
Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did
You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced
by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real
reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve
simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared
to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in
simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.

*John Mavi,Diana Teodora Găitan,Sergio Coronado*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究评估了8种主流大语言模型（LLM）在拒绝违反国际人道法（IHL）提示时的表现，发现模型虽能拒绝非法请求，但回应的清晰度和一致性存在差异。标准化安全提示显著提升了拒绝解释的质量，但复杂提示仍暴露漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补LLM与国际人道法（IHL）对齐性研究的空白，确保AI系统的安全性和透明度。

Method: 评估8种LLM对明确违反IHL提示的拒绝能力，并分析其回应的清晰度和一致性。引入标准化安全提示以测试改进效果。

Result: 大多数模型能拒绝非法请求，但回应的清晰度不一。标准化提示显著提升解释质量，但复杂提示仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更安全、透明的AI系统提供了基准，并展示了轻量级干预的有效性，但复杂场景仍需改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their
alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood.
This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that
explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how
clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models
rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses
varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or
safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce
ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt
significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within
refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight
interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or
requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute
to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a
benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

### [383] [Large Language Models Can Be a Viable Substitute for Expert Political Surveys When a Shock Disrupts Traditional Measurement Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06540)
*Patrick Y. Wu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在突发事件后，专家判断受结果影响的问题，提出使用大型语言模型（LLMs）替代传统政治调查，并以2025年DOGE联邦裁员为例验证其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决突发事件后传统测量方法失效的问题，探索LLMs作为替代工具的潜力。

Method: 采用LLMs进行成对比较提示，生成联邦机构的意识形态分数，并与裁员前的专家测量结果对比。

Result: LLMs生成的分数成功复制了裁员前的专家测量结果，并预测了哪些机构被DOGE针对。此外，LLMs还揭示了机构作为知识机构的感知与裁员目标的相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs在传统测量失效时可作为替代工具，论文提出了使用LLMs的两部分标准。

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government
Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by
knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to
reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated
with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for
expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We
analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use
pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal
executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and
predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach
and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge
institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when
controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows
us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the
shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs
offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional
measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for
when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的审计框架，用于评估工人希望AI代理自动化或增强的职业任务，以及这些愿望与当前技术能力的匹配情况。通过WORKBank数据库和Human Agency Scale（HAS），研究揭示了任务分类和人类参与期望的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复合AI系统的快速发展，劳动力市场面临工作替代、人类能动性下降和对自动化过度依赖的担忧，但目前缺乏对这一演变的系统性理解。

Method: 研究引入了一种音频增强的小型访谈框架和HAS量表，构建了WORKBank数据库，收集了1,500名工人和AI专家对844项任务的偏好和能力评估。

Result: 任务被分为四个区域：自动化“绿灯”区、“红灯”区、研发机会区和低优先级区。研究还发现不同职业对HAS的期望存在多样性，并揭示了AI代理可能重塑人类核心能力的早期信号。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将AI代理开发与人类需求对齐的重要性，并为工人适应未来职场动态提供了指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the
labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency,
and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the
evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel
auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to
automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological
capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to
capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a
shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using
this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain
workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks
spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological
capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light"
Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone.
This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development.
Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse
HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for
human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent
integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from
information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the
importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing
workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

*Tzu-wen Hsu,Ke-Han Lu,Cheng-Han Chiang,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的推理时策略Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD)，通过对比解码减少大型音频-语言模型（LALMs）的幻觉问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LALMs在标准基准测试中表现良好，但存在严重的幻觉问题，即模型可能虚构音频内容。

Method: AAD通过对比解码比较音频上下文存在与否时的token预测概率，优先选择音频存在时概率增加的token。

Result: 实验表明，AAD在对象幻觉数据集上将F1分数提升了0.046至0.428，在通用音频QA数据集上准确率提升了5.4%至10.3%。

Conclusion: AAD有效缓解了LALMs的幻觉问题，并通过消融实验验证了其各组件的有效性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can take audio and text as the inputs and
answer questions about the audio. While prior LALMs have shown strong
performance on standard benchmarks, there has been alarming evidence that LALMs
can hallucinate what is presented in the audio. To mitigate the hallucination
of LALMs, we introduce Audio-Aware Decoding (AAD), a lightweight inference-time
strategy that uses contrastive decoding to compare the token prediction logits
with and without the audio context. By contrastive decoding, AAD promotes the
tokens whose probability increases when the audio is present. We conduct our
experiment on object hallucination datasets with three LALMs and show that AAD
improves the F1 score by 0.046 to 0.428. We also show that AAD can improve the
accuracy on general audio QA datasets like Clotho-AQA by 5.4% to 10.3%. We
conduct thorough ablation studies to understand the effectiveness of each
component in AAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SOT方法因说话人分配失败导致的识别错误问题，避免依赖难以提取的辅助信息。

Method: 提出Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC)，将其与SOT框架结合，通过多任务学习实现说话人区分。

Result: 实验表明，SD-CTC与SOT的多任务学习将错误率降低26%，性能接近依赖辅助信息的先进方法。

Conclusion: SD-CTC与SOT的结合提供了一种高效的多说话人语音识别解决方案，无需辅助信息。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech
recognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output
Training (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to
speaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such
as token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such
information from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address
this limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension
of CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each
frame. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT
model to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and
transcriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with
SD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在通用编程语言代码生成方面表现良好，但在硬件描述语言（HDLs）生成方面，尤其是可综合且功能正确的设计，研究较少。HDLs如SystemVerilog对时序语义、并发性和可综合性的要求严格，且设计流程复杂。

Method: 论文提出了针对四种通信协议的基准测试套件，定义了不同设计抽象层次和提示明确性的代码生成任务。通过波形仿真和测试台评估生成设计的语法正确性、可综合性和功能保真度。

Result: 生成的设计在语法正确性、可综合性和功能保真度方面进行了评估，具体结果未提及。

Conclusion: 论文填补了LLMs在HDL生成领域的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. In
contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly
for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains
significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and
demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability
constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks
beyond structural code generation, including testbench development,
assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration
for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the
capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog
implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of
embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the
first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and
AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design
abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for
syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform
simulation and test benches.

Conclusion: QForce-RL在资源效率、性能和灵活性方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has outperformed other counterparts in sequential
decision-making and dynamic environment control. However, FPGA deployment is
significantly resource-expensive, as associated with large number of
computations in training agents with high-quality images and possess new
challenges. In this work, we propose QForce-RL takes benefits of quantization
to enhance throughput and reduce energy footprint with light-weight RL
architecture, without significant performance degradation. QForce-RL takes
advantages from E2HRL to reduce overall RL actions to learn desired policy and
QuaRL for quantization based SIMD for hardware acceleration. We have also
provided detailed analysis for different RL environments, with emphasis on
model size, parameters, and accelerated compute ops. The architecture is
scalable for resource-constrained devices and provide parametrized efficient
deployment with flexibility in latency, throughput, power, and energy
efficiency. The proposed QForce-RL provides performance enhancement up to 2.3x
and better FPS - 2.6x compared to SoTA works.

Motivation: 躁动是痴呆患者常见的反应行为，早期预测可减少护理负担并改善生活质量。

Method: 研究引入了基于活动数据的躁动相关特征，评估了多种机器学习和深度学习模型，包括二元分类和异常检测，使用了TIHM数据集。

Result: 最佳模型（LightGBM）在二元分类中表现出色，AUC-ROC为0.9720，AUC-PR为0.4320。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面评估了基于隐私保护传感器数据的躁动预测技术，支持主动护理和居家养老。

Abstract: Agitation is one of the most common responsive behaviors in people living
with dementia, particularly among those residing in community settings without
continuous clinical supervision. Timely prediction of agitation can enable
early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life
for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark
machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in
community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A
new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was
introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine
learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem
formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular
sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly
detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the
Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia,
comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most
effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the
current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp.
Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation
history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720
and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work
presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques
for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using
privacy-preserving sensor data. The approach enables accurate, explainable, and
efficient agitation prediction, supporting proactive dementia care and aging in
place.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决心电图信号中心跳分类的问题，比较传统特征提取与深度学习图像转换方法的优劣。

Method: 1. 传统机器学习：提取HRV、均值、方差等特征，训练SVM、随机森林等模型；2. 深度学习：将ECG信号转换为图像（GAF、MTF、RP），并用CNN分类。

Result: LightGBM表现最佳（准确率99%，F1分数0.94），优于CNN方法（F1分数0.85）。

Conclusion: 手工特征能更好地捕捉ECG信号的时空变化，未来可结合多导联信号和时序依赖提升分类效果。

Abstract: This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals
through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing
hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats.
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering,
and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis.
In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean,
variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers,
including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and
LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images
using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and
Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN
architectures like VGG and Inception.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest
performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the
image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost
yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this
task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to
capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to
image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may
benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies
across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hype Index as a novel metric to quantify media
attention toward large-cap equities, leveraging advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for extracting predictive signals from financial news. Using
the S&P 100 as the focus universe, we first construct a News Count-Based Hype
Index, which measures relative media exposure by computing the share of news
articles referencing each stock or sector. We then extend it to the
Capitalization Adjusted Hype Index, adjusts for economic size by taking the
ratio of a stock's or sector's media weight to its market capitalization weight
within its industry or sector. We compute both versions of the Hype Index at
the stock and sector levels, and evaluate them through multiple lenses: (1)
their classification into different hype groups, (2) their associations with
returns, volatility, and VIX index at various lags, (3) their signaling power
for short-term market movements, and (4) their empirical properties including
correlations, samplings, and trends. Our findings suggest that the Hype Index
family provides a valuable set of tools for stock volatility analysis, market
signaling, and NLP extensions in Finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下环境（如涵洞）光线昏暗且缺乏特征，机器人视觉面临挑战。现有照明方法存在反射、过曝和功耗问题。

Method: 提出NightHawk框架，利用贝叶斯优化在线调整光照强度和曝光时间，并设计基于特征检测器的图像效用指标作为优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，特征检测和匹配性能提升47-197%，视觉估计更可靠。

Conclusion: NightHawk有效解决了地下环境中的视觉优化问题，为机器人导航提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Subterranean environments such as culverts present significant challenges to
robot vision due to dim lighting and lack of distinctive features. Although
onboard illumination can help, it introduces issues such as specular
reflections, overexposure, and increased power consumption. We propose
NightHawk, a framework that combines active illumination with exposure control
to optimize image quality in these settings. NightHawk formulates an online
Bayesian optimization problem to determine the best light intensity and
exposure-time for a given scene. We propose a novel feature detector-based
metric to quantify image utility and use it as the cost function for the
optimizer. We built NightHawk as an event-triggered recursive optimization
pipeline and deployed it on a legged robot navigating a culvert beneath the
Erie Canal. Results from field experiments demonstrate improvements in feature
detection and matching by 47-197% enabling more reliable visual estimation in
challenging lighting conditions.

Motivation: 传统车载感知系统因遮挡和盲区精度有限，云端方案延迟高，无法满足实时需求。ECOD旨在通过边缘计算和多车协作解决这些问题。

Method: ECOD框架包含PACE（多车数据聚合）和VOTE（共识投票分类）算法，在边缘服务器实时运行，并通过硬件测试床验证。

Result: 实验表明ECOD在物体分类准确率上比传统方法提升75%，同时实现低延迟实时处理。

Conclusion: 边缘计算和多车协作能显著提升CAV的实时感知能力，适用于延迟敏感场景。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board
perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,
while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them
unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative
framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that
leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,
multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key
algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and
Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data
from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where
individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting
mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data
from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in
real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We
develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped
robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our
experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of
improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional
single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,
edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of
edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive
autonomous systems.

Method: 提出粗到精的候选过滤、旋转增强方法和自蒸馏框架。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1和v2中分别达到93.5% PDMS和87.1% EPDMS，展示了卓越的安全关键能力和轨迹质量。

Conclusion: DriveSuprim在安全性和性能上优于现有方法，适用于复杂驾驶场景。

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely.
Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually
does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory.
Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple
trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face
optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands
of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences,
especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to
overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based
augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and
a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS
in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical
capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while
maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

TL;DR: GTRS提出了一种统一的端到端多模态规划框架，结合粗粒度和细粒度轨迹评估，解决了静态和动态轨迹评分方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹评分方法在泛化能力上存在显著不足，静态词汇表难以适应细粒度调整，动态提案无法捕捉更广泛的轨迹分布。

Method: GTRS包含三项创新：扩散式轨迹生成器、词汇表泛化技术和传感器增强策略。

Result: GTRS在Navsim v2挑战赛中表现优异，接近依赖真实感知的特权方法。

Conclusion: GTRS通过结合粗粒度和细粒度评估，显著提升了轨迹评分的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning is a promising paradigm in autonomous
driving, enabling decision-making with diverse trajectory candidates. A key
component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal
trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on
scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically
generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization.
Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to
make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision
but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified
framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and
fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary
innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse
fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a
scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its
robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy
that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement
training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the
Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with
sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on
ground-truth perception. Code will be available at

Result: RoboCerebra提供了更长的动作序列和更密集的标注，显著优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了更强大和通用的机器人规划器的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled
instruction-conditioned robotic systems with improved generalization. However,
most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs'
strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2
capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under
explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for
evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation.
RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task
horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a
hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level
vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol
targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2
interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT
generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human
operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality
trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks,
RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser
annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and
analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the
development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.

Abstract: Learning to control high-speed objects in the real world remains a
challenging frontier in robotics. Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for
this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and
precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental
challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately
predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic
planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature
of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it
particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in
fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present
SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation
learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two
key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a
spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in
ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties
such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module
that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system
harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,
combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory
correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target
area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant
performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated
tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic
control in high-speed dynamic tasks.

Conclusion: 多模态空间语言地图为机器人导航和交互提供了更灵活的视觉、音频和空间线索支持。

Abstract: Grounding language to a navigating agent's observations can leverage
pretrained multimodal foundation models to match perceptions to object or event
descriptions. However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment
mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional
modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal
spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained
multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these
maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our
maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to
audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When
combined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural
language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., "in between the
sofa and TV") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across
different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.
Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a
unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues
through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.
This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or
audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the
incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal
disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps
enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by
50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and
tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual,
audio, and spatial cues.

Abstract: Spatial awareness is a critical capability for embodied agents, as it enables
them to anticipate and reason about unobserved regions. The primary challenge
arises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by
sparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing
methods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not
generalize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \textbf{MapBERT},
a novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen
spaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps
aligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first
time, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact
bitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer
missing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.
To enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking
strategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with
learnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object
embeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more
effectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical
robotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves
state-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency
with accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across
a wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size
poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic
systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the
inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,
its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present
BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every
parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint
of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that
compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,
a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent
representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA
achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with
4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only
29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on
memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多代理系统的记忆机制过于简单，缺乏跨试验和代理特定的定制化，限制了其自我进化能力。

Method: 引入G-Memory，一种基于组织记忆理论的分层记忆系统，通过洞察图、查询图和交互图三层结构进行双向记忆检索和动态更新。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，G-Memory显著提高了任务成功率和知识问答准确率，分别提升至20.89%和10.12%。

Conclusion: G-Memory为多代理系统提供了一种高效的记忆架构，支持其持续进化，无需修改原有框架。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have
demonstrated cognitive and execution capabilities that far exceed those of
single LLM agents, yet their capacity for self-evolution remains hampered by
underdeveloped memory architectures. Upon close inspection, we are alarmed to
discover that prevailing MAS memory mechanisms (1) are overly simplistic,
completely disregarding the nuanced inter-agent collaboration trajectories, and
(2) lack cross-trial and agent-specific customization, in stark contrast to the
expressive memory developed for single agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce
G-Memory, a hierarchical, agentic memory system for MAS inspired by
organizational memory theory, which manages the lengthy MAS interaction via a
three-tier graph hierarchy: insight, query, and interaction graphs. Upon
receiving a new user query, G-Memory performs bi-directional memory traversal
to retrieve both $\textit{high-level, generalizable insights}$ that enable the
system to leverage cross-trial knowledge, and $\textit{fine-grained, condensed
interaction trajectories}$ that compactly encode prior collaboration
experiences. Upon task execution, the entire hierarchy evolves by assimilating
new collaborative trajectories, nurturing the progressive evolution of agent
teams. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, three LLM backbones, and
three popular MAS frameworks demonstrate that G-Memory improves success rates
in embodied action and accuracy in knowledge QA by up to $20.89\%$ and
$10.12\%$, respectively, without any modifications to the original frameworks.

Abstract: The integration of deep learning-based glaucoma detection with large language
models (LLMs) presents an automated strategy to mitigate ophthalmologist
shortages and improve clinical reporting efficiency. However, applying general
LLMs to medical imaging remains challenging due to hallucinations, limited
interpretability, and insufficient domain-specific medical knowledge, which can
potentially reduce clinical accuracy. Although recent approaches combining
imaging models with LLM reasoning have improved reporting, they typically rely
on a single generalist agent, restricting their capacity to emulate the diverse
and complex reasoning found in multidisciplinary medical teams. To address
these limitations, we propose MedChat, a multi-agent diagnostic framework and
platform that combines specialized vision models with multiple role-specific
LLM agents, all coordinated by a director agent. This design enhances
reliability, reduces hallucination risk, and enables interactive diagnostic
reporting through an interface tailored for clinical review and educational
use. Code available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/MedChat.

Abstract: Faithfully reconstructing textured shapes and physical properties from videos
presents an intriguing yet challenging problem. Significant efforts have been
dedicated to advancing such a system identification problem in this area.
Previous methods often rely on heavy optimization pipelines with a
differentiable simulator and renderer to estimate physical parameters. However,
these approaches frequently necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning for
each scene and involve a costly optimization process, which limits both their
practicality and generalizability. In this work, we propose a novel framework,
Vid2Sim, a generalizable video-based approach for recovering geometry and
physical properties through a mesh-free reduced simulation based on Linear
Blend Skinning (LBS), offering high computational efficiency and versatile
representation capability. Specifically, Vid2Sim first reconstructs the
observed configuration of the physical system from video using a feed-forward
neural network trained to capture physical world knowledge. A lightweight
optimization pipeline then refines the estimated appearance, geometry, and
physical properties to closely align with video observations within just a few
minutes. Additionally, after the reconstruction, Vid2Sim enables high-quality,
mesh-free simulation with high efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in reconstructing
geometry and physical properties from video data.

Abstract: We leverage repetitive elements in 3D scenes to improve novel view synthesis.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly
improved novel view synthesis but renderings of unseen and occluded parts
remain low-quality if the training views are not exhaustive enough. Our key
observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We
propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of
low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose
a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction,
registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances.
Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance
variations across instances. We demonstrate our method on a variety of
synthetic and real scenes with typical repetitive elements, leading to a
substantial improvement in the quality of novel view synthesis.

Result: 实验表明，加入这两种损失后，模型在CLIP分数、背景多样性和视觉质量上优于DreamBooth。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了微调中的欠拟合和过拟合问题，提升了生成图像的质量和多样性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by
adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However,
existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where
the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it
memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion
fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the
predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent
with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject
consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to
multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject
identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that
incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity
but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP
scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for
high-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields
such as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive
algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices
remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper
presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.
First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of
common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve
this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses
shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,
effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by
identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,
we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent
blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for
costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to
improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization
and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing
array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we
introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and
Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves
rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy
savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes. We
plan to open-source our design to foster further development in this field.

Conclusion: HOI-PAGE通过部分级功能推理，实现了更真实和多样化的4D HOI合成。

Abstract: We present HOI-PAGE, a new approach to synthesizing 4D human-object
interactions (HOIs) from text prompts in a zero-shot fashion, driven by
part-level affordance reasoning. In contrast to prior works that focus on
global, whole body-object motion for 4D HOI synthesis, we observe that
generating realistic and diverse HOIs requires a finer-grained understanding --
at the level of how human body parts engage with object parts. We thus
introduce Part Affordance Graphs (PAGs), a structured HOI representation
distilled from large language models (LLMs) that encodes fine-grained part
information along with contact relations. We then use these PAGs to guide a
three-stage synthesis: first, decomposing input 3D objects into geometric
parts; then, generating reference HOI videos from text prompts, from which we
extract part-based motion constraints; finally, optimizing for 4D HOI motion
sequences that not only mimic the reference dynamics but also satisfy
part-level contact constraints. Extensive experiments show that our approach is
flexible and capable of generating complex multi-object or multi-person
interaction sequences, with significantly improved realism and text alignment

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved remarkable success in reconstructing both
static and dynamic 3D scenes. However, in a scene represented by 3D Gaussian
primitives, interactions between objects suffer from inaccurate 3D
segmentation, imprecise deformation among different materials, and severe
rendering artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIG:
Physically-Based Multi-Material Interaction with 3D Gaussians, a novel approach
that combines 3D object segmentation with the simulation of interacting objects
in high precision. Firstly, our method facilitates fast and accurate mapping
from 2D pixels to 3D Gaussians, enabling precise 3D object-level segmentation.
Secondly, we assign unique physical properties to correspondingly segmented
objects within the scene for multi-material coupled interactions. Finally, we
have successfully embedded constraint scales into deformation gradients,
specifically clamping the scaling and rotation properties of the Gaussian
primitives to eliminate artifacts and achieve geometric fidelity and visual
consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of visual quality, but also
opens up new directions and pipelines for the field of physically realistic
scene generation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在几何精度和渲染质量上显著优于现有技术，且实时性高（单GPU上0.015秒/推理）。

Conclusion: 该方法为分辨率无关的3D场景增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing the resolution and geometric
fidelity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) beyond native training resolution.
Current 3DGS methods are fundamentally limited by their input resolution,
producing reconstructions that cannot extrapolate finer details than are
present in the training views. Our work breaks this limitation through a
lightweight generative model that predicts and refines additional 3D Gaussians
where needed most. The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling
strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit
from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally
intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time
(0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for
interactive applications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for resolution-free 3D
scene enhancement.

Conclusion: SpeeDe3DGS模块化设计可集成到任何可变形3DGS或4DGS框架中，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve
high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the
time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian
neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting
rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,
we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general
pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS
representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary
techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that
identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene
reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that
improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.
Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters
Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation
per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our
techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by
$7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.
SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on
the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be
integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.

TL;DR: Squeeze3D是一种新型框架，利用预训练的3D生成模型的隐式先验知识，实现极高压缩比的3D数据压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D数据压缩方法难以在保持视觉质量的同时实现高压缩比，Squeeze3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过可训练的映射网络连接预训练编码器和生成模型的潜在空间，将3D数据压缩为紧凑的潜在代码，再通过生成模型解压缩。

Result: 实验显示，Squeeze3D在纹理网格、点云和辐射场上的压缩比分别达到2187x、55x和619x，且视觉质量与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: Squeeze3D提供了一种高效、灵活的3D数据压缩方法，无需特定对象训练，适用于多种3D格式。

Abstract: We propose Squeeze3D, a novel framework that leverages implicit prior
knowledge learnt by existing pre-trained 3D generative models to compress 3D
data at extremely high compression ratios. Our approach bridges the latent
spaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through
trainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or
a radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then
transformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent
code can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the
mesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code
into the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned
to recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained
entirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The
Squeeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D
encoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different
formats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments
demonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for
textured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while
maintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only
incurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve
training object-specific networks to compress an object.

Result: 简单的3x3分区和5网格重叠显著提高了检索效果，并对标注框的扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于位置的提示可以有效提升专业领域中的模糊文本查询性能。

Abstract: Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based
querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing
performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous,
specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can
often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to
discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding
location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance
retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human
annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding
boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using
these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various
static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that
both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve
retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation
box.

Motivation: 稀疏视图CT可以减少辐射剂量，但重建问题具有病态性，现有深度学习和扩散模型缺乏物理可解释性或计算成本高。

Method: 基于PFGM++，ResPF引入条件指导和劫持策略减少采样成本，嵌入数据一致性确保重建质量，并通过残差融合模块保持轨迹连续性。

Result: 在合成和临床数据集上，ResPF在重建质量、推理速度和鲁棒性上优于现有迭代、学习和扩散模型。

Conclusion: ResPF是首个将Poisson Flow模型应用于稀疏视图CT的方法，显著提升了重建性能和效率。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce
radiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and
diffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical
interpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,
particularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image
synthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose
Residual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional
guidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to
significantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.
However, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce
unrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each
iteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling
relies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by
electrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,
resulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we
introduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with
data-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow
models to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical
datasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,
faster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art
iterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPAD和SPC技术能高精度检测光子，但二进制SPC图像导致纹理和颜色信息严重丢失，传统3D合成技术难以应用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段用Pix2PixHD等生成模型将二进制SPC图像转换为RGB图像；第二阶段用NeRF或3DGS进行3D场景重建。

Result: 实验验证了该框架在感知质量和几何一致性上的显著提升。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效解决了SPC图像的信息丢失问题，为3D重建和辐射场恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) represent a cutting-edge imaging
technology, capable of detecting individual photons with remarkable timing
precision. Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable
image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high
illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such
SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images
leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making
traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we
propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into
high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image
(I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary
SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D
scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline
(Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and
geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images enables morphometric
analysis of nuclei structures, which in turn helps in the detection and
diagnosis of diseases under consideration. To develop a nuclei segmentation
algorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,
image-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to
target domain image representations. One of the important issues with
image-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the
information content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this
regard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei
structures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding
space for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological
image space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating
judiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model
develops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization
framework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator
automatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss. The
proposed model also introduces a spatially-constrained squeeze operation within
the framework of invertible generator to maintain spatial continuity within the
image patches. The model provides a better trade-off between network complexity
and model performance compared to other existing models having complex network
architectures. The performance of the proposed deep generative model, along
with a comparison with state-of-the-art nuclei segmentation methods, is
demonstrated on publicly available histological image data sets.

Conclusion: 该模型通过解耦表示和空间注意力机制，实现了对细胞核结构的准确分割和颜色外观的标准化，具有较高的通用性和适应性。

Abstract: Segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images is an important task
for automated computer-aided analysis of histological images, particularly in
the presence of impermissible color variation in the color appearance of
stained tissue images. While color normalization enables better nuclei
segmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color
normalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep
generative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and
normalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model
judiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial
attention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,
corresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective
nuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled
representation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification
or loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei
segmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the
stain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color
appearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.
The proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for
segmentation of nuclei regions from histological images. The performance of the
proposed approach, along with a comparative analysis with related
state-of-the-art algorithms, has been demonstrated on publicly available
standard histological image data sets.

Abstract: Brain tumors, regardless of being benign or malignant, pose considerable
health risks, with malignant tumors being more perilous due to their swift and

critical areas in MRI scans that influenced the categorization. VGG16 achieved
the most accuracy, attaining 99.17%. The integration of XAI enhanced the
system's transparency and stability, rendering it more appropriate for clinical
application in resource-limited environments such as Bangladesh. This study
highlights the capability of deep learning models, in conjunction with

Conclusion: TMC通过改进跨模态交互和语义表达，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving
as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring,
thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However,
existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic
expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low
contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address
this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the
lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient
cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To
resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception
network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to
enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage
alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results
of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance
with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19,
MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided
methods.

Result: 实验表明，提出的编码器优于现有神经B帧编码器，性能接近H.266/VVC参考软件。

Conclusion: 通过改进运动压缩和时间融合，显著提升了神经B帧编码的性能。

Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame
coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most
existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without
adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to
suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for
motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we
design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an
interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive
quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional
motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and
reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an
interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between
bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging
partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a
selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to
achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal
contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a
hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.
By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent
representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the
fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and
achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC
reference software under random-access configurations.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示为什么大型语言模型无法避免幻觉，并明确其内在限制。

Method: 通过将LLM推理建模为“想法拍卖”，并利用Green-Laffont定理证明不可能性。

Result: 证明了无法同时满足真实性、语义信息守恒、相关知识揭示和知识约束最优性。

Conclusion: 为理解推理过程的本质提供了数学基础，对模型架构、训练目标和评估方法有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language
models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking
for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no
inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties:
\textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information
conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained
optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where
neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the
impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework
provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference
process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and
evaluation methods.
