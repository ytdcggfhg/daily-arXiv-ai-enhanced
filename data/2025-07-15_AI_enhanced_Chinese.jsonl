We cast the\nextraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,\nclassifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,\nQuantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;\n(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model\nis pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial\ndocument dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on\neach classification head.

Transformer-based LLMs face\nsignificant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,\ndue to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value\n(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models.

We compare the modeling assumptions, application\nscenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM\nadvances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and\ncross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical\ninterpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty\nquantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation\nfoundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling\ncapacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u9065\u611f\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FM\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5404\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3FM\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9065\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6e10\u88ab\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u548cFM\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u4ee3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6f14\u53d8\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982PROSPECT\u3001SCOPE\uff09\u5230\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff09\u518d\u5230FM\uff08\u5982SatMAE\u3001GFM\uff09\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5404\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8FM\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3FM\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u6311\u6218\u5982\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7b49\u3002"}}

Prior work reading out depth or\nillumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical\nfor flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a\nsim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,\nwhich can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer\nperturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we\nextend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular\narchitectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner\nis aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future\nframes (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat\neach spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that\ncan condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely\npresent in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.\nBuilding on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that\ninjects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one\nstep, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and\nunperturbed predictive distributions.

The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli.

However, its performance remains\nconstrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D\ndatasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of\ntext-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is\ntrained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To\ninvestigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the\nSD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text\nencoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that\nallows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the\ntrained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input\nand point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D\nbackbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating\ndirect semantic learning.

In this paper, we analyze the variations in\nthe modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.\nOur observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent\nto which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we\npropose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's\nperformance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap\npreservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance\nthe capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective\nfor continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring\nadditional replay data.

While tokenization has revolutionized\nimage and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a\ncritical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose\n$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method\ndecouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The\nintra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to\nhierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The\ninter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across\ntimesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while\nretaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only\nGPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and\npredicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene\ngeneration. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,\nensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that\n$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing\nmethods by 25.1\\% in mIoU and 36.9\\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while\nexhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of\ntraining memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term\ndecay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in\nLVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction\ntokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions\nwithin the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the\nbottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are\npositionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to\ninsufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.\nWe refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's\nperception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose\nMCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a\ntwo-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay.

For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring.

This representation\nsupports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by\nenabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term\ntracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are\navailable to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,\nreal-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate\ncausally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in\nstreaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based\non past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes\nessential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,\noffer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack\ntemporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines\nto enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term\npoint tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially\nwithout access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating\nthe suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they\ncan serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.\nHowever, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design\nis still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this\ncausal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across\nframes. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that\ntreats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.\nTrack-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u957f\u65f6\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5Track-On\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Track-On\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u9010\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4f20\u64ad\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "Track-On\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u957f\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff1bTrack-On\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Transformer\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These issues manifest differently in\nvision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing\nsolutions remain domain-specific. We propose \\textit{StaRFM}, a unified\nframework addressing both challenges.

Additionally, a confidence\nmisalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,\ncalibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes\nbounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP\nminimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization.

However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set.

TinyRM combines FLAN-style\nprompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to\nachieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer\nresources.

The peer-reviewed version of this paper has been\n  accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for\napplications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework\ntrained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot\ngeneralization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for\nscalable calibration without the associated computational costs.

To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce\nProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's\nability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated\nat varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts\nfor the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate\nevaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive\nbenchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of\nhuman preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human\npreferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider\nthe textual content of responses.

Building on these\nobservations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework\nfor 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention\nPrediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the\nglobal attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token\nimportance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual\ntoken Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through\nattention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise\npruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques\noperate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive\nevaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,\nparticularly under high visual token pruning ratios.

Poster available\n  online at https://tjchase34.github.io/assets/pdfs/rss_poster.pdf", "summary": "The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial\nfor autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation\n(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data\ncollection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive\na priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational\nlimitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these\napproaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low\nprocessing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based\ncomputer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and\novercome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently\nimpose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft\nhardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of\nlabeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,\nwe present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and\ndescription. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network\narchitectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft\nflight processors.

To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation.

Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u6b8a\u2018\u601d\u8003\u7ed3\u675f\u2019\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u4f4e\u8d21\u732e\u63a8\u7406\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982AIME\u548cAMC\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods\nthat rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a\ndynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables\nthe model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the\ninput scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse\nbackgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to\nbetter capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more\naccurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that\nDRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in\ndetection accuracy.

Various deep learning\napproaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have\nbeen developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).\nHowever, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and\nmonocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its\nconversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of\nprompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract\nestimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a\nframework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for\nabsolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and\nhigh-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program\n(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived\nDEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM\nestimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x\nresolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of\nmagnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust\ngeneralization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with\n< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological\nanalysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We\ndemonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.\nand Israel.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources.

Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which\nintegrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful\ntrade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general\nsemantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving\nlocation-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features.

However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an\nentropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world\nscenarios.

In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to\nswiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural\nlanguage instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric\nrendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and\nestablish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying\nthe foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute\nprediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model\nto generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD\narchitecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic\ndesign tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a\nnew solution for graphic design.", "AI": {"tldr": "IGD\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u521b\u9020\u529b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0d\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "IGD\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u56fe\u5c42\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIGD\u5728\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "IGD\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u56fe\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize\ntexture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.\nIn this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel\nadversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional\nparameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry\nand appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on\npatches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,\nscale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce\nphysically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce\na physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical\naugmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing\nattack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both\nvirtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.\nExperimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from\n87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.\nMoreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical\nconditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable\nadversarial attacks.

This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images.

Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters\nand is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal\nmodel. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the\neffectiveness and versatility of ARL.

Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation.

In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models.

To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model.

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,\nidentity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing\naverage-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality\nreference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during\nthe denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity\ninformation from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention\nmechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip\nidentity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback\nlearning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with\nsuffix-weighted temporal aggregation.

However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs.

Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual\nfeature adapter to refine each category textual representation.

Such\ndescription diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can\nbenefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic\nadapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,\nit is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To\naddress these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter\nand develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first\nmodels the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class\nrelationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex\nRandom Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message\npropagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each\nclass node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve\ntextual adapter learning.

Although existing methods\nintroduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality\nreference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,\nmainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a\nRefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating\nmasks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image.

In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system.

These\nmodels have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread\nadoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious\nconcerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process\nor expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation\nof privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack\nstrategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of\nInterests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing\nsensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining\nimage. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire\nimage, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental\nresults across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and\nBLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while\nmaintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity\nscores between clean and adversarial outputs.

We\nvalidate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation\nshowing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled\nlearning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks\nusing noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal\nbehavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to\ncontrol velocity.

Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains\nlargely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate\nthis process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence\nrepresentations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the\npotential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this\nwork, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models\nannotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our\npipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs\nto generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural\nlanguage descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this\napproach for text-conditioned CAD generation.

In\ncontrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we\ncondition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and\nsynthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a\npatch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how\nto translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling\nthe patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene\nrepresentation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians\non-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ\ncolor-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality\nresults and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images.
