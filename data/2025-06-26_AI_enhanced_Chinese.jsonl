An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines.

However, removing\nundesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality\nremains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive\nModel (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept\nerasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation\n(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and\nThresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the\ntarget concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,\nErase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more\nrigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR\nmodels. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of\ntarget-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from\nthese prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to\nensure concept fidelity and alignment.

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the\nSPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase\nrecognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming\nfull-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

Using this model, we filter our\ncorpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and\nfeed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened\nin an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.\nWe employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper\narticles from 2009 to 2023.

Despite advances in\nthis field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with\nlimited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging\nscarcity of real-world data.

To\naddress the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial\ntransformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u6ce8\u518c\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08MSI\uff09\u878d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5149\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SPL\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u76f2\u7a00\u758f\u878d\u5408\uff08BSF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u9f50HSI\u548cMSI\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u518c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528SPL\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6HSI\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u63d0\u5347MSI\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u518cHSI\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51faBSF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b49\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u6027\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528PAO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3BSF\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6ce8\u518c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408BSF\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This\ndenoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned\nlatent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of\nhigher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs.

Existing radiomic\napproaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at\nthe population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While\ninterpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent\nindividual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based\napproaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent\nend-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic\nfeatures. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic\nselection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the\npoor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic\nfingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is\ndynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the\nexisting radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient\nbasis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and\nselecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual\npatients.

What makes a base language model\nsuitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question\nis essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next\ngeneration. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance.

To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient\ntracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation\nacross various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,\nwhich connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing\nfeature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image\nposition encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information.

DyHiT uses search\narea features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an\nefficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios.

The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs\nare particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and\ninference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify\nthe decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we\nsystematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.\nFor RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and\nmaintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel\nsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used\nin training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves\nDiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\\% on EvalPlus) and\nreduces reliance on AR causal during decoding.

However, training\ndiffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and\nexisting zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond\ntraining resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and\nspatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,\nzero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural\ncoherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion\nmodels. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from\nthe pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel\nwavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion\nmethods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the\nbase image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer\nretains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural\nconsistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine\ndetails and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL\ndemonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in\nprior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality.

This makes frequent\nassessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and\nminimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of\nrock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground\nmines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock\nbolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the\nautomatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point\nclouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing\ntechniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature\nengineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such\ntechniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due\nto data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.\nMoreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale\npoint clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of\nreinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an\napproach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning\narchitecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the\nautomatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point\nclouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nmodels by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.\nAdditionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,\nachieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,\ndemonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDeepBolt\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5ca9\u77f3\u87ba\u6813\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u4e2d\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\u87ba\u6813\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u52a0\u56fa\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6d88\u8017\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4e5f\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeepBolt\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u590d\u67423D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5ca9\u77f3\u87ba\u6813\u3002", "result": "DeepBolt\u5728\u5ca9\u77f3\u87ba\u6813\u70b9\u7684IoU\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8642.5%\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523096.41%\u548c96.96%\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepBolt\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ca9\u77f3\u87ba\u6813\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to\nbe effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce\nsemi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.\nState-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial\nCNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional\nneural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a\nchallenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to\nfully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to\nconstruct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image\nmodeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with\nmasked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels\nfrom labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked\ndomain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and\ndevise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the\noriginal and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.\nWe also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network.

Despite promising results\nwere achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene\nevolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore\nperform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a\nrelatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into\nshort video segments for captioning at a finer level.

We\nparticularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that\neffectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.\nWe achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and\nlearning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues.

To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that\nenables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore\nfrom arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge\ninto two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts\nand floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures\nspatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality\nin novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration\nmodel designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data\ncollection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for\nWorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D\nscene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose\nConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously\nrestores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering\nquality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global\ncoherence and consistency.

Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual\nfeatures to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect\nforged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to\nidentify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative\nnetworks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ\ndepending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within\nthe RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become\nmore sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes\nexisting forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing\ndata. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,\ndesigned to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging\nspatial and frequency domain features.

A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their\ntypical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs\nhave largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard\nAO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from\nrefinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the\nlanguage's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural\ninfluences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that\nwhile encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,\ndecoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\\sim25\\times$) and\ncomparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly\nlarger space, highlighting key trade-offs.

However, learning-based methods often face challenges\nwith limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform\ncompared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While\niterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are\nconsiderably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,\nwe propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines\nthe strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better\nbalance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement\nentropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each\nvoxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it\nintroduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy\nreceives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level\nimage pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential\ncomplexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive\nlearning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature\nextraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to\noutperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching\nstate-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.

Few of them can provide both a\nwell-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.\nAdditionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from\nintroducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data\nleakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation\nframework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).\nSpecifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic\ndata. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their\nparameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional\ndistillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions\nso that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show\nthat FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFedBKD\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAN\uff09\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedBKD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528GAN\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u65b9\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFedBKD\u5728\u4e0d\u540cnon-IID\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FedBKD\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FL\u4e2d\u7684non-IID\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

While CNN-based\nand Transformer-based models have been widely applied to medical image\nsegmentation, CNNs lack global context modeling due to local receptive fields,\nand Transformers, though capable of capturing long-range dependencies, are\ncomputationally expensive. Recently, state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba,\nhave gained attention for their ability to model long sequences with linear\ncomplexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a U-shaped network composed of a\nProgressive Visual State Space (PVSS) encoder and a Hybrid Visual State Space\n(HVSS) decoder that work collaboratively to achieve efficient and accurate\nsegmentation of hepatic echinococcosis (HE) lesions. The proposed Convolutional\nVision State Space Block (CVSSB) module is designed to fuse local and global\nfeatures, while the Haar Wavelet Transformation Block (HWTB) module compresses\nspatial information into the channel dimension to enable lossless downsampling.\nDue to the lack of publicly available HE datasets, we collected CT slices from\n260 patients at a local hospital.

Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable\nperceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively\nimpacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.\nTo systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and\nperformance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual\nquestion-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse\nset of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key\ndomains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction\nunderstanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social\nnavigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected\ndata from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue\nunderstanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four\ndomains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of\n1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of\nboth state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.\nOur results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still\nstruggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of\nthe models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory\nperformance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring\nthe need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with\nimproved human perception capabilities.

However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in\nthese biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it\nappears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by\nthe poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic\nResonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate\nsegmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft\nfeature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is\nuseful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies\n(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has\nbeen passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the\nhull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under\ndiscussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved\nsegmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning\nmethods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of\nIoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with\nthe PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task.
