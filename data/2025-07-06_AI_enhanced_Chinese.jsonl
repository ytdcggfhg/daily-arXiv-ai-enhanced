In this work, we present a novel zero-shot multimodal approach for\nCER that combines six heterogeneous modalities into a single pipeline: static\nand dynamic facial expressions, scene and label matching, scene context, audio,\nand text. Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,\nour approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image\nPretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene\nunderstanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)\nmodule that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a\nCompound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability\nAggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods\nto produce interpretable compound emotion outputs.

In this\nwork, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the\nfeedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by\nPQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks.

Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured\nQFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its\nclassical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific\nparameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive\nedge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data\nefficiency.

Typically, satellite or airborne images used\nfor training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where\nthe same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this\npaper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for\ncross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on\nextracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in\nthe independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and\nseparability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed\nto guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM.

This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "SAM\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ViRefSAM\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cViRefSAM\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAM\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSynapseRoute\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u663e\u8457\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b058%\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u9898\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSynapseRoute\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSynapseRoute\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff080.8390 vs. 0.8272\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f436.8%\u548ctoken\u6d88\u801739.66%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5f15\u5165AIT\u6307\u6570\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e09\u8005\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

Submitted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline\ncandidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and\nalgorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases.

Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the\ntime-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and\n25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFUSE\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u80fd\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\u7531\u4e8eCPU\u3001GPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u73b0\u6709LLM\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1FUSE\u8fd9\u4e00\u7edf\u4e00\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "FUSE\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c117.0%-16.9%\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1125.4%-36.8%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "FUSE\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8c03\u63a7\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684CPU\u3001GPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision.

Although these models\nhave unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not\noffer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is\ninherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders\nenables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering\nexplicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an\nencoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,\nwhich learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the\nlatent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the\nlatent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing\nregion-specific cellular patterns in brain images.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and\nglaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing\nTTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios.

Extracting metadata from regulations to\nelicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.\nHowever, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal\ntext. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting\nstructural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they\ndo not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes\nassociated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or\nheuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new\ndocuments.

IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination\nmodules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the\npoint of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a \"two-factor\nauthentication (human and IA)\" system, it reduces human error in view\nclassification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.\nAdditionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23\nkey points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and\ndorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.\nExperimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,\nachieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a\npixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm.

Empirical\nresults on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals\nstate-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing\nruntime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude.

Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our\nevaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians\noutperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency\ndetails like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular\nreflections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHyperGaussians\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u9006\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6280\u5de7\u2019\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperGaussians\uff0c\u5c063D\u9ad8\u65af\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u9006\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6280\u5de7\u2019\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u9762\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u768419\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHyperGaussians\u5728\u6570\u503c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u773c\u955c\u6846\u3001\u7259\u9f7f\u3001\u590d\u6742\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u9ad8\u5149\u53cd\u5c04\u7b49\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperGaussians\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent\nnovel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from\nonly sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model\nthat can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics\n(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge\nintegration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),\ntrained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language\nembeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.\nFinally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language\ninformation onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language\nqueries.

Existing T2V methods typically rely\non text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout\nof generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence\non real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.\nAlthough some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based\nconditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require\ncomputationally expensive training.

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system.

Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis\nmaturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature).

This\noverlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift\npermanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid\nadaptation.\n  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift\nthat simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a\nbaseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained\nfrom scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution.

Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is\nessential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling\ninteraction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is\noften treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality\nin its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a\nwindow into how intelligent systems engage with the world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u662f\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5f0f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5171\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5e94\u6210\u4e3aAI\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u3002"}}

Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains\nchallenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has\nbenefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be\nnotoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has\nsucceeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still\nlargely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing\nMultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into\ntraditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase\nour framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on\nmultimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation\nvideo, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without\nany real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world\npouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of\ngenerative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the\nmultimodal sim-to-real gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "MultiGen\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5012\u6c34\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u7b49\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u903c\u771f\u97f3\u9891\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u611f\u5b98\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5012\u6c34\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u5bb9\u5668\u548c\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u7f29\u5c0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}
