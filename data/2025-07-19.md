### [1] [Modeling Open-World Cognition as On-Demand Synthesis of Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12547)
*Lionel Wong,Katherine M. Collins,Lance Ying,Cedegao E. Zhang,Adrian Weller,Tobias Gersternberg,Timothy O'Donnell,Alexander K. Lew,Jacob D. Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Tyler Brooke-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了模型综合架构（MSA），结合分布式和符号表示来构建针对新情况的定制化心理模型，用于模拟人类在开放性推理任务中的判断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类面对新情况时能够从广泛的背景知识中调用相关信息进行推理和预测，研究者想要探索人类如何获取全局相关信息并进行连贯推理的机制。

Method: 提出模型综合架构（MSA），使用语言模型实现全局相关性检索和模型综合，使用概率程序实现定制化、连贯的世界模型，结合分布式和符号表示构建针对特定情况的心理模型。

Result: 在"模型奥运会"体育场景数据集上的评估显示，MSA方法在捕获人类判断方面优于仅使用语言模型的基线方法，无论是在直接生成还是思维链生成模式下都表现更好。

Conclusion: MSA能够镜像人类在全局相关变量上进行局部连贯推理的能力，为理解和复制人类在开放性领域中的推理提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant
considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use
in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant
information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that
people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to
construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a
computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''
(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval
and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent
world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel
reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of
sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning
by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;
(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in
light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA
approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,
under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports
model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way
that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over
globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating
human reasoning in open-ended domains.

### [2] [Is This Just Fantasy? Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12553)
*Michael A. Lepori,Jennifer Hu,Ishita Dasgupta,Roma Patel,Thomas Serre,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型（LMs）能够通过线性表示（模态差异向量）更可靠地分类句子模态，且这些向量在模型训练过程中按一致顺序出现。此外，这些向量还能模拟人类细粒度分类行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究质疑LMs分类句子模态的能力，本文旨在揭示LMs是否具备更可靠的模态分类判断。

Method: 通过识别LMs中的模态差异向量，分析其在训练过程中的出现顺序，并对比人类分类行为。

Result: LMs的模态分类能力优于先前报告，且模态差异向量能模拟人类分类行为。

Conclusion: 研究为LMs模态分类提供了新见解，并可能帮助理解人类模态分类机制。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question
answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these
tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,
whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely
nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the
ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,
2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that
discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal
difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have
access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously
reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a
consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,
layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors
identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human
categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human
participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by
correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'
ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM
modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with
the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Motivation: 为车臣语这一弱势语言提供翻译支持，探索如何将新语言整合到多语言翻译系统中。

Method: 通过微调NLLB-200模型，训练并评估车臣语与俄语的翻译性能。

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLP模型（尤其是BioClinicalBERT）能高效分类药物过量死亡报告，显著提升监测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国药物过量死亡数据因依赖人工ICD-10编码而延迟且不准确，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用35,433条2020年死亡记录训练模型，并在3,335条2023-2024年记录上验证。评估了多种NLP方法，包括BERT、BioClinicalBERT及大型语言模型。

Result: BioClinicalBERT表现最佳，内部测试F1分数≥0.998，外部验证F1=0.966，优于传统方法和通用模型。

Conclusion: NLP模型（如BioClinicalBERT）能高效、准确地分类药物过量死亡报告，支持实时监测。

Abstract: The rising rate of drug-related deaths in the United States, largely driven
by fentanyl, requires timely and accurate surveillance. However, critical
overdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays
and information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of
Disease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may
automate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been
limited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in
2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was
conducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.
Multiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug
involvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included
traditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned
encoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large
language models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed
using macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to
quantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect
performance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External
validation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional
machine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large
language models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like
BioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose
death classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly
accelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10
coding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use
trends.

### [5] [AdaptiSent: Context-Aware Adaptive Attention for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12695)
*S M Rafiuddin,Sadia Kamal,Mohammed Rakib,Arunkumar Bagavathi,Atriya Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaptiSent是一个用于多模态基于方面的情感分析（MABSA）的新框架，通过自适应跨模态注意力机制提升情感分类和方面词提取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多模态数据时未能充分利用文本和图像之间的交互信息，AdaptiSent旨在通过动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力机制解决这一问题。

Method: AdaptiSent整合了动态模态加权和上下文自适应注意力机制，专注于文本线索和视觉上下文的交互，以提取更准确的情感和方面信息。

Result: 在标准Twitter数据集上，AdaptiSent在精确率、召回率和F1分数上均优于现有模型，尤其在识别跨模态的微妙关系方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaptiSent为MABSA设立了新标准，显著优于现有方法，特别是在理解复杂多模态信息方面。

Abstract: We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms
to improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text
and images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and
context-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and
aspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context
interact. We tested our approach against several baselines, including
traditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from
standard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in
precision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying
nuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and
aspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to
adjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the
depth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.
AdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current
methods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.

### [6] [AudioJudge: Understanding What Works in Large Audio Model Based Speech Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12705)
*Potsawee Manakul,Woody Haosheng Gan,Michael J. Ryan,Ali Sartaz Khan,Warit Sirichotedumrong,Kunat Pipatanakul,William Held,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AudioJudge，利用大型音频模型（LAM）作为统一评估框架，解决现有语音评估的局限性，并通过多任务实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音评估存在两个主要问题：针对不同音频特性设计专用系统的需求与困难，以及自动评估方法与人类偏好之间的相关性较差。

Method: 研究AudioJudge在音频特性检测任务（如发音、语速、说话人识别和语音质量）和系统级人类偏好模拟中的应用，探索不同提示工程策略，并引入多角度集成方法。

Result: 音频拼接结合上下文学习显著提升性能，多角度集成方法在系统排名基准中与人类偏好的Spearman相关性达0.91。

Conclusion: LAMs在噪声环境下表现稳健，但仍需解决冗长性和位置偏差问题。

Abstract: Current speech evaluation suffers from two critical limitations: the need and
difficulty of designing specialized systems targeting individual audio
characteristics, and poor correlation between automatic evaluation methods and
human preferences. This work presents a systematic study of Large Audio Model
(LAM) as a Judge, AudioJudge, investigating whether it can provide a unified
evaluation framework that addresses both challenges. We systematically explore
AudioJudge across audio characteristic detection tasks, including
pronunciation, speaking rate, speaker identification and speech quality, and
system-level human preference simulation for automated benchmarking. We
investigate different prompt engineering strategies, finding that audio
concatenation combined with in-context learning significantly improves
performance across both audio characteristic detection and human preference
simulation tasks. We further introduce a multi-aspect ensemble AudioJudge to
enable general-purpose multi-aspect audio evaluation. This method decomposes
speech assessment into specialized judges for lexical content, speech quality,
and paralinguistic features, achieving up to 0.91 Spearman correlation with
human preferences on our system ranking benchmark. Robustness analysis reveals
that while LAMs maintain strong performance under acoustic noise, they exhibit
significant verbosity and positional biases that require careful mitigation.

### [7] [FLEXITOKENS: Flexible Tokenization for Evolving Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12720)
*Abraham Toluase Owodunni,Orevaoghene Ahia,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLEXITOKENS提出了一种可学习的字节级语言模型分词方法，解决了传统分词器在适应新数据分布时的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子词分词器在适应新数据分布时表现僵硬，导致分词效率低下，尤其是在未见过的语言或脚本中。

Method: 开发了字节级语言模型，通过可学习的分词器动态预测输入字节序列的分割边界，并提出FLEXITOKENS训练目标以增强灵活性。

Result: 在多语言基准测试和形态多样性任务中，FLEXITOKENS显著减少了分词碎片化，下游任务性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: FLEXITOKENS通过可学习的分词器实现了更高的适应性和性能提升，为语言模型的分词问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are challenging to adapt to new data distributions by
simple finetuning. This is due to the rigidity of their subword tokenizers,
which typically remain unchanged during adaptation. This inflexibility often
leads to inefficient tokenization, causing overfragmentation of
out-of-distribution domains, unseen languages, or scripts. In this work, we
develop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.
Our models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the
input byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments. Existing
tokenizer-free methods train this boundary predictor using an auxiliary loss
that enforces a fixed compression rate across the training corpus, introducing
a new kind of rigidity. We propose FLEXITOKENS, a simplified training objective
that enables significantly greater flexibility during adaptation. Evaluating
across multiple multilingual benchmarks, morphologically diverse tasks, and
domains, we demonstrate that FLEXITOKENS consistently reduces token
over-fragmentation and achieves up to 10\% improvements on downstream task
performance compared to subword and other gradient-based tokenizers. Code and
data for our experiments will be released at

### [8] [TransEvalnia: Reasoning-based Evaluation and Ranking of Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12724)
*Richard Sproat,Tianyu Zhao,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransEvalnia是一个基于提示的翻译评估和排名系统，通过推理进行细粒度评估，性能优于现有技术，并与人类评分高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够提供细粒度翻译评估和排名的系统，以改进现有翻译评估方法。

Method: 使用多维质量指标子集，结合Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct等LLM进行推理评估。

Result: 在多种语言对上表现优于MT-Ranker，评分与人类评分高度相关，但存在位置偏差问题。

Conclusion: TransEvalnia是一个有效的翻译评估工具，需进一步解决位置偏差问题。

Abstract: We present TransEvalnia, a prompting-based translation evaluation and ranking
system that uses reasoning in performing its evaluations and ranking. This
system presents fine-grained evaluations based on a subset of the
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (https://themqm.org/), returns an assessment
of which translation it deems the best, and provides numerical scores for the
various dimensions and for the overall translation. We show that TransEvalnia
performs as well as or better than the state-of-the-art MT-Ranker (Moosa et al.
2024) on our own English-Japanese data as well as several language pairs from
various WMT shared tasks. Using Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct as the evaluation LLMs, we show that the evaluations
returned are deemed highly acceptable to human raters, and that the scores
assigned to the translations by Sonnet, as well as other LLMs, correlate well
with scores assigned by the human raters. We also note the sensitivity of our
system -- as well as MT-Ranker -- to the order in which the translations are
presented, and we propose methods to address this position bias. All data,
including the system's evaluation and reasoning, human assessments, as well as
code is released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于玩家态度和对话上下文切换策略的狼人杀智能体改进方法，验证了其优于固定或隐式策略的基线智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有狼人杀智能体通过提示工程使用隐式策略，无法适应动态变化的情境。

Method: 显式选择基于游戏上下文和玩家角色估计的合适策略。

Result: 策略自适应智能体优于固定或隐式策略的基线智能体。

Conclusion: 显式策略选择方法能有效提升狼人杀智能体的性能。

Abstract: This study proposes a method to improve the performance of Werewolf agents by
switching between predefined strategies based on the attitudes of other players
and the context of conversations. While prior works of Werewolf agents using
prompt engineering have employed methods where effective strategies are
implicitly defined, they cannot adapt to changing situations. In this research,
we propose a method that explicitly selects an appropriate strategy based on
the game context and the estimated roles of other players. We compare the
strategy adaptation Werewolf agents with baseline agents using implicit or
fixed strategies and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种解码时方法，通过小模型引导大模型进行长推理，无需额外训练。ThinkLogit-DPO通过偏好优化进一步提升性能，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能在无需额外训练的情况下激发大模型的长推理能力。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，利用小模型引导大模型进行长推理；进一步提出ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练小模型。

Result: ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO在数学数据集上分别提升26%和29%的pass@1性能。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit提供了一种计算高效的方法，无需额外训练即可激发大模型的长推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long
chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and
self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess
these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our
work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any
training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which
utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for
long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that
we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our
experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative
improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical
datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model
21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills
acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative
compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a
computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with
minimal or no additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过端到端方式桥接不同抽象级别的语言模型，探索无分词器架构的潜力。

Method: 训练字节级语言模型，学习路由机制，并与BBPE和Llama3进行比较。

Result: Synergy在相同规模和数据集下优于Llama3，且中间部分无需位置编码表现更好。

Conclusion: Synergy展示了无分词器架构的可行性，为更灵活的语言模型铺平道路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different
levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing
mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model
as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize
bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE)
tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we
observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training
dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction
part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed,
suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings
demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for
more robust and flexible pipelines.

*Thinh Hung Truong,Karin Verspoor,Trevor Cohn,Timothy Baldwin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过从大型语言模型蒸馏数据的方法，提升文本编码器对否定语义的鲁棒性，同时保持通用任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归大型语言模型快速发展，小文本编码器在需要丰富上下文表示的任务中仍很重要。否定语义功能尚未被充分捕捉，影响依赖文本嵌入的下游应用。

Method: 从大型语言模型蒸馏多样否定和模糊模式数据，采用对比学习微调BERT模型。

Result: 显著提升否定理解能力，同时保持通用任务竞争力；方法可适配大型语言模型，提升否定基准性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升文本编码器对否定语义的鲁棒性，且具有通用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Despite rapid adoption of autoregressive large language models, smaller text
encoders still play an important role in text understanding tasks that require
rich contextualized representations. Negation is an important semantic function
that is still not properly captured by such methods, affecting many downstream
applications relying on text embeddings. We propose a strategy to improve
negation robustness of text encoders, by distilling data from large language
models using diverse patterns of negation and hedging. We adopt a standard
contrastive learning strategy to finetune a strong BERT-based model, and
observe large improvement in negation understanding capabilities while
maintaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. In addition, we also
show that our method can be adapted to LLMs, leading to improved performance on
negation benchmarks.

TL;DR: LLMs能通过文本提示生成符号音乐数据，并评估其在音乐识别和生成任务中的表现，结果显示LLMs能推断基本音乐结构，但也存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在符号音乐领域的潜力，尤其是它们如何通过文本描述隐式建模音乐概念。

Method: 生成LLM驱动的MIDI数据集，训练神经网络进行音乐分类和生成任务，并与现有模型对比。

Result: LLMs能推断基本音乐结构和时间关系，但缺乏明确音乐背景限制了其表现。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号音乐生成中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以克服局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings
in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic
domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they
implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates
how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from
textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating
their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of
LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then
train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform
genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their
performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can
infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text,
highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and
their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on
their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了跨语言一致性对事实知识的影响，分析了多语言模型在不同语言间的知识一致性表现，并探讨了提升一致性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言一致性对评估跨语言迁移能力、保持模型知识的事实性以及语言模型性能的平衡至关重要。

Method: 通过分析代码混合的共指陈述，使用可解释性方法研究模型在跨语言上下文中的行为。

Result: 多语言模型在不同语言家族、语言因素和特定层上表现出一致性差异；代码切换训练和跨语言词对齐目标显示出提升一致性的潜力。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐监督和代码切换训练对提升多语言性能和一致性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual
transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across
languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus
interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency
for factual knowledge. We examine code-mixed coreferential statements conveyed
identical knowledge across languages to study cross-lingual knowledge
consistency. We use some interpretability approaches to analyze the behavior of
a model in cross-lingual contexts, discovering that multilingual models show
different levels of consistency, subject to language families, linguistic
factors, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer.
In addition, we evaluate common strategies aimed at improving multilingual
performance to observe whether these strategies can improve knowledge
consistency at the same time. While knowledge is not cross-lingual consistency
in many cases, code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment
objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the noteworthiness of
cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching training for both
multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement.

Motivation: 受人类分层思维能力的启发，探索构建分层解码器架构的可能性。

Method: 将预训练语言模型的最后一层语言头复制到选定的中间层，并用不同任务输入进行微调。

Result: 实验验证了中间层可以生成合理内容，并在分层文本分类、分类引导生成等任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可以从头预训练一个通用的分层推理器。

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the
last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose
that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers
decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally
resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of
hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different
selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By
thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers
could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm
of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple
tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided
generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the
possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

Motivation: 解决西班牙语表格问答任务的需求，提升问答系统的准确性和效率。

Method: 通过多步骤流程：分析表格内容、选择有用列、生成自然语言指令、翻译为代码并执行，使用开源LLM和优化提示。

Result: 在任务中实现了85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格问答任务，展示了LLM在自然语言处理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas
y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in
Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python
code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This
solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task.
The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content
of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural
language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling
potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and
fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved
an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的形式化模型，用于描述攻击场景及其上下文，基于UML类模型抽象，支持攻击分析和自动化攻击脚本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织面临不断变化的威胁环境，需要提高网络安全自动化水平，而自动化需要输入数据的规范化。

Method: 提出了一种基于UML类模型的抽象形式化模型，涵盖攻击场景及其上下文。

Result: 模型可用于上游攻击分析和自动化生成攻击脚本，支持网络安全培训。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络安全自动化提供了实用工具，解决了攻击场景形式化的问题。

Abstract: Organizations face an ever-changing threat landscape. They must continuously
dedicate significant efforts to protect their assets, making their adoption of
increased cybersecurity automation inevitable. However, process automation
requires formalization of input data. Through this paper, we address this need
for processes that use attack scenarios as input. Among these processes, one
can mention both the generation of scripts for attack simulation and training
purposes, as well as the analysis of attacks. Therefore, the paper's main
research contribution is a novel formal model that encompasses the attack's
context description and its scenario. It is abstracted using UML class model.
Once the description of our model done, we will show how it could serve an
upstream attack analysis process. We will show also its use for an automatic
generation of attack scripts in the context of cybersecurity training. These
two uses cases constitute the second contribution of this present research
work.

*Marc Brinner,Sina Zarriess*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCSE是一种无监督学习方法，用于学习科学文本的语义嵌入，通过对比学习和LLM生成的摘要训练模型，实现语义相关文本在嵌入空间中的接近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于引用的方法未必反映语义相似性，因此需要一种能捕捉文本真实语义内容的方法。

Method: 利用LLM生成的科学摘要进行对比学习，训练模型使语义相关摘要的嵌入更接近。

Result: 在科学文本嵌入的基准测试中，SemCSE表现出色，实现了同类模型中的最优性能。

Conclusion: SemCSE通过语义聚焦的训练方法，显著提升了科学文本嵌入的语义分离能力。

Abstract: We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings
of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for
text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific
abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer
together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the
model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional
citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity.
To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's
ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts,
demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within
the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive
SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the
benefits of a semantically focused training approach.

TL;DR: 该博士提案计划开发一个计算框架，用于识别文本中的自我方面，填补自然语言处理（NLP）领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我是一个多面性概念，在语言中有所体现，但在NLP中尚未充分探索。其与心理健康等现象相关，需要系统性分析。

Method: 计划构建自我方面的本体和标注数据集，开发并评估判别模型、生成模型和嵌入检索方法。

Result: 最佳模型将应用于心理健康和现象学的案例研究。

Conclusion: 该框架有望为NLP中的自我分析提供系统化工具，并推动相关领域的研究。

Abstract: This Ph.D. proposal introduces a plan to develop a computational framework to
identify Self-aspects in text. The Self is a multifaceted construct and it is
reflected in language. While it is described across disciplines like cognitive
science and phenomenology, it remains underexplored in natural language
processing (NLP). Many of the aspects of the Self align with psychological and
other well-researched phenomena (e.g., those related to mental health),
highlighting the need for systematic NLP-based analysis. In line with this, we
plan to introduce an ontology of Self-aspects and a gold-standard annotated
dataset. Using this foundation, we will develop and evaluate conventional
discriminative models, generative large language models, and embedding-based
retrieval approaches against four main criteria: interpretability, ground-truth
adherence, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Top-performing models will
be applied in case studies in mental health and empirical phenomenology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了标注者人口特征对标注决策的影响，发现其仅占方差的8%，推文内容是主要因素。生成式AI作为标注者时，简单的人口角色提示效果不佳，内容驱动的方法更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解标注变异性来源对公平NLP系统开发至关重要，尤其是在性别歧视检测等任务中。

Method: 使用广义线性混合模型量化人口特征影响，并评估生成式AI作为标注者的可靠性。

Result: 人口特征影响虽存在但较小（8%），生成式AI的简单角色提示效果不佳，内容驱动方法更优。

Conclusion: 内容驱动的解释和稳健的标注协议比人口角色模拟更能实现公平性。

Abstract: Understanding the sources of variability in annotations is crucial for
developing fair NLP systems, especially for tasks like sexism detection where
demographic bias is a concern. This study investigates the extent to which
annotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text
content. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,
finding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a
minor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the
dominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models
as annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic
personas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that
simplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,
performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)
techniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific
tokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic
characteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and
robust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than
potentially persona simulation.

Motivation: 探讨口语叙事能力对后期读写发展的预测作用，并识别需要干预的儿童的特征。

Method: 使用简单机器学习方法分析4-5岁儿童的录音故事，比较阿非利卡语和科萨语。

Result: 词汇多样性和句子长度是典型发展的指标，特定动词和助动词的使用与干预需求减少相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言特异性和共享的叙事能力预测因素，对多语言环境下的早期评估有重要意义。

Abstract: Oral narrative skills are strong predictors of later literacy development.
This study examines the features of oral narratives from children who were
identified by experts as requiring intervention. Using simple machine learning
methods, we analyse recorded stories from four- and five-year-old Afrikaans-
and isiXhosa-speaking children. Consistent with prior research, we identify
lexical diversity (unique words) and length-based features (mean utterance
length) as indicators of typical development, but features like articulation
rate prove less informative. Despite cross-linguistic variation in
part-of-speech patterns, the use of specific verbs and auxiliaries associated
with goal-directed storytelling is correlated with a reduced likelihood of
requiring intervention. Our analysis of two linguistically distinct languages
reveals both language-specific and shared predictors of narrative proficiency,
with implications for early assessment in multilingual contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GEMMAS是一个基于图的评估框架，通过建模多智能体交互为有向无环图，分析协作过程，提出信息多样性评分（IDS）和不必要路径比率（UPR）两个过程级指标，揭示协作效率差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终输出的正确性，忽略了低效通信和协调导致的冗余推理和高计算成本。

Method: 引入GEMMAS框架，建模智能体交互为有向无环图，并提出IDS和UPR两个过程级指标。

Result: 在GSM8K基准测试中，准确率仅差2.1%的系统在IDS和UPR上差异显著（12.8%和80%）。

Conclusion: 仅依赖结果指标不足以评估多智能体性能，过程级诊断对设计高效协作AI系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on language models have shown strong performance on
collaborative reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluations focus only on the
correctness of the final output, overlooking how inefficient communication and
poor coordination contribute to redundant reasoning and higher computational
costs. We introduce GEMMAS, a graph-based evaluation framework that analyzes
the internal collaboration process by modeling agent interactions as a directed
acyclic graph. To capture collaboration quality, we propose two process-level
metrics: Information Diversity Score (IDS) to measure semantic variation in
inter-agent messages, and Unnecessary Path Ratio (UPR) to quantify redundant
reasoning paths. We evaluate GEMMAS across five benchmarks and highlight
results on GSM8K, where systems with only a 2.1% difference in accuracy differ
by 12.8% in IDS and 80% in UPR, revealing substantial variation in internal
collaboration. These findings demonstrate that outcome-only metrics are
insufficient for evaluating multi-agent performance and highlight the
importance of process-level diagnostics in designing more interpretable and
resource-efficient collaborative AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期儿童叙事和理解能力对后期识字至关重要，但教师在大班教学中难以准确识别需要干预的学生。

Method: 系统结合自动语音识别和机器学习评分模型，比较线性模型与LLM的表现。

Result: LLM在大多数情况下优于线性模型，但线性模型表现也不差；LLM系统在标记需要干预的儿童方面与人类专家相当。

Conclusion: 为课堂自动口语评估奠定了基础，帮助教师更专注于个性化支持儿童学习。

Abstract: Developing narrative and comprehension skills in early childhood is critical
for later literacy. However, teachers in large preschool classrooms struggle to
accurately identify students who require intervention. We present a system for
automatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and
isiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine
learning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For
scoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language
model (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,
but the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity. The LLM-based
system is comparable to a human expert in flagging children who require
intervention. We lay the foundation for automatic oral assessments in
classrooms, giving teachers extra capacity to focus on personalised support for
children's learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAST的新框架，通过操纵大语言模型的内部激活状态，实现跨任务知识迁移，无需参数更新或输入扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数据稀缺场景下对未见任务的适应性不足，现有跨任务上下文学习方法在鲁棒性、可扩展性和效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 通过分析大语言模型潜在空间的激活模式，提出CAST框架，利用高资源任务的样本增强激活状态，适应低资源任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨领域和跨语言迁移任务中优于基线方法，具有更高的可扩展性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: CAST框架通过激活状态操纵实现了高效的跨任务知识迁移，为数据稀缺场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging
pretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen
tasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context
learning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it
still faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and
efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be
achieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input
expansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of
LLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples
have consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we
propose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that
enables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation
states. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from
high-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced
activations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across
both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method
outperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and
lower computational costs.

Result: 模型在英语提示下表现最佳，新方法提升了印地语类比问题的解决能力。

Conclusion: HATS填补了印地语推理评估资源的空白，新方法有效提升了模型表现。

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between
concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities.
While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in
English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our
understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address
this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405
multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark
state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and
introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive
theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on
Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with
English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses
the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in
Hindi.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSteer是一种模块化、自适应的推理时间干预技术，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性，无需微调底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但也面临对抗性多模态输入的安全风险。

Method: AutoSteer包含三个核心组件：安全感知分数（SAS）、自适应安全探测器和轻量级拒绝头，用于识别和干预潜在安全风险。

Result: 实验表明，AutoSteer显著降低了文本、视觉和跨模态威胁的攻击成功率（ASR），同时保持模型的一般能力。

Conclusion: AutoSteer为多模态AI系统的安全部署提供了实用、可解释且有效的框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked
powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns,
particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the
safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive
inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any
fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core
components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically
identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal
layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of
toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal
Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are
detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical
benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining
general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,
interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI
systems.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在大型语言模型训练中很重要，但其在多步推理任务中的效果受到质疑，尤其是在难题上。因此，研究提出了一种改进方法。

Method: 采用问题增强策略（QuestA），在训练中引入部分解决方案，降低问题难度并提供更丰富的学习信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，QuestA显著提升了pass@1和pass@k性能，尤其在标准RL难以解决的问题上。1.5B参数模型在多个数学基准测试中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: QuestA不仅提高了样本效率，还为通过RL扩展推理能力提供了一条实用且可推广的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large
language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its
effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via
Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce
problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method,
QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only
improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL
struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong
open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing
their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math
benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%)
on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical
explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and
generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏公开数据和基准测试，自然语言处理和大语言模型在人力资源管理中的应用受到限制，TalentCLEF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建真实、匿名且手动标注的多语言数据集，设计两个任务（多语言职位匹配和技能预测），并评估模型的性别偏见。

Result: 吸引了76个团队参与，结果显示训练策略比模型规模更重要，且多语言编码器模型表现优异。

Conclusion: TalentCLEF为劳动力市场提供了首个公开基准，促进了稳健、公平和可迁移的语言技术发展。

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving
a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in
building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition,
upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and
progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable
and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which
have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation
campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two
tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,
German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.
Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and
manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor
market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered
the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most
systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual
encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them
incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The
results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of
the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field
and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language
technologies for the labor market.

Result: RCPS在所有质量维度上显著优于基线方法，接近人类专家水平；PREVAL与人类评价高度相关。

Conclusion: RCPS和PREVAL为自动化生成和评估高质量演示提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated generation of high-quality media presentations is challenging,
requiring robust content extraction, narrative planning, visual design, and
overall quality optimization. Existing methods often produce presentations with
logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet
professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS
(Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating
three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive
Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose
PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced
multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content,
Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly
outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing
presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows
strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated
tool for assessing presentation quality.

Method: 基于1500个专家标注的NLP论文示例构建AbGen基准，评估LLMs生成消融研究设计的能力，并开发AbGen-Eval评估自动化评估系统的可靠性。

Result: LLMs在消融研究设计上表现显著低于人类专家，且自动化评估方法不可靠。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的LLM评估系统，以支持复杂科学任务。

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities
of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists
of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this
benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for
a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our
evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a
significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of
the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not
reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to
human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a
meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used
automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We
investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for
future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation
systems for complex scientific tasks.

Motivation: 设计有意义的触觉信号具有挑战性，缺乏大规模标注数据集和现有模型描述能力的不足是主要问题。

Method: 创建HapticCap数据集，提出触觉描述检索任务，采用监督对比学习框架结合T5和AST模型。

Result: T5和AST模型组合在触觉描述检索任务中表现最佳，尤其在分类训练时效果显著。

Conclusion: HapticCap数据集和提出的方法为触觉信号与文本描述的匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Haptic signals, from smartphone vibrations to virtual reality touch feedback,
can effectively convey information and enhance realism, but designing signals
that resonate meaningfully with users is challenging. To facilitate this, we
introduce a multimodal dataset and task, of matching user descriptions to
vibration haptic signals, and highlight two primary challenges: (1) lack of
large haptic vibration datasets annotated with textual descriptions as
collecting haptic descriptions is time-consuming, and (2) limited capability of
existing tasks and models to describe vibration signals in text. To advance
this area, we create HapticCap, the first fully human-annotated
haptic-captioned dataset, containing 92,070 haptic-text pairs for user
descriptions of sensory, emotional, and associative attributes of vibrations.
Based on HapticCap, we propose the haptic-caption retrieval task and present
the results of this task from a supervised contrastive learning framework that
brings together text representations within specific categories and vibrations.
Overall, the combination of language model T5 and audio model AST yields the
best performance in the haptic-caption retrieval task, especially when
separately trained for each description category.

indexical bias, political polarization, and sources of bias -- an important
question remains underexplored: how do search engines and
ideologically-motivated user queries contribute to bias in search results. This
study analyzes the outputs of major search engines using a dataset of political
and social topics. The findings reveal that search engines not only prioritize
content in ways that reflect underlying biases but also that
ideologically-driven user queries exacerbate these biases, resulting in the
amplification of specific narratives. Moreover, significant differences were
observed across search engines in terms of the sources they prioritize. These
results suggest that search engines may play a pivotal role in shaping public
perceptions by reinforcing ideological divides, thereby contributing to the
broader issue of information polarization.

TL;DR: VL训练是否显著改变语言模型的语义表示？研究发现VL训练主要影响词汇-概念知识的任务表现，而非其本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言（VL）训练是否对语言模型的语义表示产生显著影响，尤其是在词汇-概念知识的分类组织方面。

Method: 通过比较纯文本语言模型（LM）和VL训练模型（VLM）在文本问答任务中的表现，分析其分类知识及任务表现差异。

Result: VL模型在需要分类理解的文本任务中表现更好，但其分类知识本身与纯文本模型无显著差异，差异在于任务中的知识运用方式。

Conclusion: VL训练未显著改变分类知识本身，但改善了其在特定任务中的运用能力。

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations
of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have
shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and
representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain
in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual
knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal
pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that
the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only
question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts
mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and
representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ
significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in
how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs.
a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does
not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does
improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task,
even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长度泛化任务中的核心挑战，探索更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出TAIL方法，通过计算机程序合成模仿图灵机执行过程的链式思考数据，以线性扩展推理步骤并减少动态和长程数据访问的难度。

Result: 在合成数据集上，TAIL显著提升了Qwen2.5-7B模型的长度泛化能力和任务表现，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 图灵机的关键概念对长度泛化至关重要，为未来基于合成数据的LLM推理学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than
those observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based
large language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly
focused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic
manipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited
overall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a
broader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that
algorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this
perspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to
improve the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes
chain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing
Machine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into
atomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch
mechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in
elementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we
construct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and
18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length
generalization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various
tasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.
The experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,
instead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length
generalization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors
consistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.
This work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of
LLM reasoning from synthetic data.

Method: 通过分析1300多篇研究论文，分解上下文工程的基础组件（检索、生成、处理、管理）和系统实现（RAG、记忆系统、多代理系统）。

Result: 发现模型在理解复杂上下文方面表现优异，但在生成复杂长文本方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 未来研究需解决生成能力与理解能力的不对称问题，为上下文感知AI提供统一框架。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined
by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces
Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design
to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We
present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its
foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate
them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:
context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We
then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create
sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through
this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only
establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical
research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While
current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate
remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit
pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.
Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,
this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers
advancing context-aware AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算幽默研究集中于简单双关笑话，忽略了复杂幽默形式，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含4种笑话类型的600个笑话数据集，并手动编写高质量解释，比较多种LLMs的零样本解释能力。

Result: 测试的LLMs（包括推理模型）均无法可靠生成对所有笑话类型的充分解释。

Conclusion: 现有计算幽默研究过于关注简单笑话形式，需进一步研究复杂幽默的解释能力。

Abstract: Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life,
whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on
short pun-based jokes. In this work, we investigate whether the ability of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour
form. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that
requires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a
dataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality
explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,
contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on
reasoning beyond "common sense", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding
news events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot
abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of
different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour
explanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are
capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further
highlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly
simple joke forms.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏对3D动态的内部建模能力。

Result: 在SAT基准测试中平均性能提升超过8%，优于基于强化学习的VLM。

Conclusion: MindJourney展示了通过世界模型进行测试时扩展的潜力，为3D推理提供了一种简单且即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable
for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However,
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks
as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion:
they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore
propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this
missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video
diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the
world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then
reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive
exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average
8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT,
showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a
simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also
improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement
learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world
models for test-time scaling.

Abstract: This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model.
Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often
suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these
challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a
pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data
via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an
advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a
multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an
innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize
its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves
competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively
expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper
and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++
introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and
re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,
it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these
designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,
while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate
our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out
of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared
to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves
similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.

Abstract: Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial
data, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the
first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,
encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer
learning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,
we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite
image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise
classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of
varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified
optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.
The evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural
sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from
CDL trusted pixels and field surveys.
  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval
preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal
performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid
training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and
direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques
enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop
classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,
workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a
sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate
and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that
matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop
mapping. Repository:

Abstract: Understanding radiologists' eye movement during Computed Tomography (CT)
reading is crucial for developing effective interpretable computer-aided
diagnosis systems. However, CT research in this area has been limited by the
lack of publicly available eye-tracking datasets and the three-dimensional
complexity of CT volumes. To address these challenges, we present the first
publicly available eye gaze dataset on CT, called CT-ScanGaze. Then, we
introduce CT-Searcher, a novel 3D scanpath predictor designed specifically to
process CT volumes and generate radiologist-like 3D fixation sequences,
overcoming the limitations of current scanpath predictors that only handle 2D
inputs. Since deep learning models benefit from a pretraining step, we develop
a pipeline that converts existing 2D gaze datasets into 3D gaze data to
pretrain CT-Searcher. Through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
CT-ScanGaze, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and provide a
comprehensive assessment framework for 3D scanpath prediction in medical

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is
challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest
environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional
neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails
to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the
tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion
dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature
extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information
propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including
standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors
for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This
hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically
differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree
structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for
all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS,
outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On
FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to
MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN
and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on
ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to
state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for
resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy.
Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object
recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud
processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at

achieving up to 63.9% accuracy in predicting shot direction (left or right),
outperforming the real goalkeepers' decisions. These results demonstrate the

Conclusion: Funnel-HOI通过编码器阶段的优化和多模态信息利用，显著提升了HOID性能，尤其在零样本和长尾场景中。

Abstract: Human-object interaction detection (HOID) refers to localizing interactive
human-object pairs in images and identifying the interactions. Since there
could be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is
limited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot
learning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object
detectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their
primary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or
disentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific
cues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene
interpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI
inspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then
associate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first
probe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then
probe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them. A novel asymmetric
co-attention mechanism mines these cues utilizing multimodal information
(incorporating zero-shot capabilities) and yields stronger interaction
representations at the encoder level. Furthermore, a novel loss is devised that
considers objectaction relatedness and regulates misclassification penalty
better than existing loss functions for guiding the interaction classifier.
Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets across
fully-supervised and six zero-shot settings reveal our state-of-the-art
performance, with up to 12.4% and 8.4% gains for unseen and rare HOI
categories, respectively.

Conclusion: CogNVS通过自监督和零样本适应，实现了高效且高质量的新视角合成。

Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos.
Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or
do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our
approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible
in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the
dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2)
hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video
diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be
self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of
in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot
to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that
CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic
scenes from monocular videos.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading global cause of mortality,
yet current risk stratification methods often fail to detect early, subclinical
changes. Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal
microvasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as
potential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics
framework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived
through deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to
highlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the
conventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate
adjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,
which is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal
phenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum
lipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography
Electrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).
Strong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly
between average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as
triacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These
associations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under
metabolic stress. By linking detailed
  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a
critical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis. This integration
not only offers a novel perspective on microvascular metabolic associations but
also presents a significant opportunity for the identification of robust,
non-invasive biomarkers. Ultimately, these findings may support improved early
detection, targeted prevention, and personalized approaches in cardiovascular
healthcare.

Abstract: Automated structural defect segmentation in civil infrastructure faces a
critical challenge: achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency for real-time deployment. This paper presents FORTRESS
(Function-composition Optimized Real-Time Resilient Structural Segmentation), a
new architecture that balances accuracy and speed by using a special method
that combines depthwise separable convolutions with adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network integration. FORTRESS incorporates three key innovations: a systematic
depthwise separable convolution framework achieving a 3.6x parameter reduction
per layer, adaptive TiKAN integration that selectively applies function
composition transformations only when computationally beneficial, and
multi-scale attention fusion combining spatial, channel, and KAN-enhanced
features across decoder levels. The architecture achieves remarkable efficiency
gains with 91% parameter reduction (31M to 2.9M), 91% computational complexity
reduction (13.7 to 1.17 GFLOPs), and 3x inference speed improvement while
delivering superior segmentation performance. Evaluation on benchmark
infrastructure datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art results with an F1- score
of 0.771 and a mean IoU of 0.677, significantly outperforming existing methods
including U-Net, SA-UNet, and U- KAN. The dual optimization strategy proves
essential for optimal performance, establishing FORTRESS as a robust solution
for practical structural defect segmentation in resource-constrained
environments where both accuracy and computational efficiency are paramount.

Abstract: We develop a neural parametric model for 3D leaves for plant modeling and
reconstruction that are essential for agriculture and computer graphics. While
neural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant
leaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible
deformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for
leaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be
approximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into
their 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning
from rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has
the advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry. To
model the 3D deformation, we propose a novel skeleton-free skinning model and
create a newly captured 3D leaf dataset called DeformLeaf. We show that
NeuraLeaf successfully generates a wide range of leaf shapes with deformation,
resulting in accurate model fitting to 3D observations like depth maps and
point clouds. Our implementation and dataset are available at

Result: 实验表明，HairShifter在视频发型转移中实现了最先进的性能，具有卓越的视觉质量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HairShifter为视频发型转移开辟了新途径，并建立了坚实的基线。

Abstract: Hair transfer is increasingly valuable across domains such as social media,
gaming, advertising, and entertainment. While significant progress has been
made in single-image hair transfer, video-based hair transfer remains
challenging due to the need for temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and
dynamic adaptability. In this work, we propose HairShifter, a novel "Anchor
Frame + Animation" framework that unifies high-quality image hair transfer with
smooth and coherent video animation. At its core, HairShifter integrates a
Image Hair Transfer (IHT) module for precise per-frame transformation and a
Multi-Scale Gated SPADE Decoder to ensure seamless spatial blending and
temporal coherence. Our method maintains hairstyle fidelity across frames while
preserving non-hair regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairShifter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in video hairstyle transfer, combining
superior visual quality, temporal consistency, and scalability. The code will
be publicly available. We believe this work will open new avenues for
video-based hairstyle transfer and establish a robust baseline in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统像素级方法缺乏对象级解剖洞察和器官间关系建模，难以应对形态复杂性和特征冲突，限制了UMIS的效果。

Method: Mamba Snake将多轮廓演化建模为分层状态空间图谱，结合Mamba Evolution Block（MEB）模块和能量图形状先验，优化检测与分割。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上的评估显示，Mamba Snake的平均Dice分数比现有方法提高了3%。

Conclusion: Mamba Snake通过建模宏观拓扑关系和微观轮廓细化，显著提升了UMIS的性能。

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive
anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural
heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level
anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with
morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in
UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state
space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a
hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ
topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a
snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB),
which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive
refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure
robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a
dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize
detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in
UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's
superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Think-Before-Draw框架有效提升了情感说话头生成的自然性和表现力。

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at
the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence,
with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through
immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large
language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has
shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current
text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts,
oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus
failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the
Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth
semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought
(CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded
facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level
semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness
optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive
guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion
localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression
dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD
and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our
model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: Reliable anticipation of traffic accidents is essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems. However, this objective is limited by two
fundamental challenges: the scarcity of diverse, high-quality training data and
the frequent absence of crucial object-level cues due to environmental
disruptions or sensor deficiencies. To tackle these issues, we propose a
comprehensive framework combining generative scene augmentation with adaptive
temporal reasoning. Specifically, we develop a video generation pipeline that
utilizes a world model guided by domain-informed prompts to create
high-resolution, statistically consistent driving scenarios, particularly
enriching the coverage of edge cases and complex interactions. In parallel, we
construct a dynamic prediction model that encodes spatio-temporal relationships
through strengthened graph convolutions and dilated temporal operators,
effectively addressing data incompleteness and transient visual noise.
Furthermore, we release a new benchmark dataset designed to better capture
diverse real-world driving risks. Extensive experiments on public and newly
released datasets confirm that our framework enhances both the accuracy and
lead time of accident anticipation, offering a robust solution to current data
and modeling limitations in safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Conclusion: 任务无关范式结合ATARA和AnyPos显著提升了模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned
control in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy
reliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and
incurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of
task-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from
task-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this
paradigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety
risks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a
scalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $
30\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective
learning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution
mismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics
model equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder
(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module
to verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%
improvement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in
downstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using
replay-based video validation. Project Page:

Result: 实验显示ReToM在FID和CLIP分数上分别提升6.2%，同时保持推理时间。

Conclusion: ReToM在视觉质量和计算效率之间取得了有效平衡。

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image,
but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the
quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods
improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention
operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image
generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose
local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging
strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge
tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries
as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we
introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative
token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting
the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most
salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental
results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP
scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time.
We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality
and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Self-attention and transformer architectures have become foundational
components in modern deep learning. Recent efforts have integrated transformer
blocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to
various efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer
with Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer
block equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and
sharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output
channel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the
computational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis
establishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with
KCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel
pruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,
ensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization
error. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact
transformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the
vision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction
accuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the
vision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer
networks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve
superior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better
performance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.

Conclusion: SVM-City数据集和City-VLM模型有效解决了户外场景理解的挑战，为多模态融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend
their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face
two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene
understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale
environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g.,
bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze
single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid
viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception
outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual
information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first
multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named
\textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale
scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and
multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k
images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from
vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To
effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we
introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding
and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is
realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than
implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation).
Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show
City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in
question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and
generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

TL;DR: DeQA-Doc利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和软标签策略，提出了一种文档质量评估框架，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档质量评估方法准确性不足，限制了实际应用。MLLMs在图像质量评估中的成功启发了将其扩展到文档领域。

Method: 通过调整DeQA-Score（一种MLLM图像质量评分器）并引入软标签策略，支持大分辨率文档图像，并采用集成方法提升性能。

Result: 实验表明DeQA-Doc在多种退化类型下均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeQA-Doc提供了一种准确且通用的文档质量评估解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications
including document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing
approaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,
limiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have
achieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we
extend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a
state-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality
assessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language
capabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document
quality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary
solutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we
relax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document
images. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly
outperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document
quality assessment across diverse degradation types. Codes and model weights

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾场景中类别样本数量的不平衡导致低频类别性能下降，而基础模型因其通用性表示能力具有潜力。现有方法忽略了视觉与文本模态的对齐，需改进。

Method: 提出Sage方法，引入SG-Adapter将类别描述作为语义引导，通过注意力机制增强视觉与文本模态对齐，并设计分布不匹配感知补偿因子纠正预测偏差。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，Sage能有效提升长尾学习性能。

Conclusion: Sage通过语义引导和分布补偿，显著改善了长尾视觉识别的性能。

Abstract: The variance in class-wise sample sizes within long-tailed scenarios often
results in degraded performance in less frequent classes. Fortunately,
foundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong
potential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which
promotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in
long-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual
encoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,
overlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we
propose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for
long-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance
derived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.
Specifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as
semantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The
introduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the
model to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the
alignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent
class-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the
resulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class
less than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware
compensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction
bias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical
analysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
Sage in enhancing performance in long-tailed learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FIQ的新方法，通过生成基于视频描述的基本问答对，增强视频问答模型的推理能力和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法主要依赖事件中心的问答对，缺乏对视频更广泛上下文的理解，限制了模型的泛化和推理能力。

Method: FIQ通过生成基于视频描述的基本问答对，并结合VQ-CAlign模块对齐视觉特征和任务特定问题嵌入。

Result: 在SUTD-TrafficQA数据集上，FIQ达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FIQ通过增强对视频的基本理解，显著提升了模型的推理能力和泛化性。

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the
interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods
primarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal
characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically
event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each
video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,
and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented
scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization
and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question
generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question
answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability
of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ
generates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the
training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable
the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced
generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign
module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,
ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the
adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate
that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的零样本CIR框架MCoT-RE，通过多角度思维链和重排序提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本CIR方法存在信息丢失或视觉上下文利用不足的问题。

Method: MCoT-RE利用多角度思维链生成两个描述，结合多粒度重排序实现精准检索。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上分别提升6.24%和8.58%。

Conclusion: MCoT-RE在无需训练的方法中达到最优性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from
a gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a
modification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot
methods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable
limitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality
independently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal
interaction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,
without fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference
image. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with
re-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes
multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit
modifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one
focused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual
context. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we
combine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained
re-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning
with the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context
of the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves
state-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of
up to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索中，早期融合过于关注文本细节而忽略视觉上下文，晚期融合难以捕捉细粒度语义对齐。

Method: FAR-Net采用多阶段融合框架，包括增强语义对齐模块（ESAM）和自适应协调模块（ARM），分别通过晚期融合和早期融合优化性能。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上，FAR-Net显著提升了Recall@1和Recall@50，分别达到2.4%和1.04%的性能提升。

Conclusion: FAR-Net为组合图像检索任务提供了一个鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a
target image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive
specification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual
modalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late
fusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual
details and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture
fine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To
address these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework
designed with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,
integrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module
(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained
semantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies
early fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and
adaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance
gains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing
state-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a
robust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.

demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image
classification.

temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our
three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV
video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world
conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and
targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance
with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small
displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and
308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the
baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with
applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological
monitoring.

Abstract: Controllable captioning is essential for precise multimodal alignment and
instruction following, yet existing models often lack fine-grained control and
reliable evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we present the AnyCap
Project, an integrated solution spanning model, dataset, and evaluation. We
introduce AnyCapModel (ACM), a lightweight plug-and-play framework that
enhances the controllability of existing foundation models for omni-modal
captioning without retraining the base model. ACM reuses the original captions
from base models while incorporating user instructions and modality features to
generate improved captions. To remedy the data scarcity in controllable
multimodal captioning, we build AnyCapDataset (ACD), covering three modalities,
28 user-instruction types, and 300\,k high-quality data entries. We further
propose AnyCapEval, a new benchmark that provides more reliable evaluation
metrics for controllable captioning by decoupling content accuracy and
stylistic fidelity. ACM markedly improves caption quality across a diverse set
of base models on AnyCapEval. Notably, ACM-8B raises GPT-4o\'s content scores

image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex

Motivation: CLIP在领域泛化中表现不佳，因其难以关注跨领域的任务相关区域（即领域不变区域）。

Method: 提出SRE方案：1）通过数据增强模拟领域偏移；2）通过注意力重聚焦减少领域偏移；3）利用集成学习增强领域不变注意力映射。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SRE表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE通过注意力重聚焦和集成学习，有效提升了CLIP在领域泛化中的性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and
apply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to
CLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing
interest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on
task-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting
in suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,
we propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and
Ensemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the
attention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain
shifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated
target domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the
attention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE
utilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant
attention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive
experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally
achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods. The code is available

Abstract: Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed
for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel
categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in
diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce
open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While
current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their
direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse
landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects
in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$
($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary
$\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates
multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to
enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce
Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context
to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context
Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global
context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for
the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance
segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that,
our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution
for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis. Our code is available at

Conclusion: HRSeg通过高效的高分辨率细粒度感知，显著提升了推理分割任务的性能。

Abstract: The reasoning segmentation task involves segmenting objects within an image
by interpreting implicit user instructions, which may encompass subtleties such
as contextual cues and open-world knowledge. Despite significant advancements
made by existing approaches, they remain constrained by low perceptual
resolution, as visual encoders are typically pre-trained at lower resolutions.
Furthermore, simply interpolating the positional embeddings of visual encoders
to enhance perceptual resolution yields only marginal performance improvements
while incurring substantial computational costs. To address this, we propose
HRSeg, an efficient model with high-resolution fine-grained perception. It
features two key innovations: High-Resolution Perception (HRP) and
High-Resolution Enhancement (HRE). The HRP module processes high-resolution
images through cropping, integrating local and global features for
multi-granularity quality. The HRE module enhances mask features by integrating
fine-grained information from high-resolution images, refining their alignment
with text features for precise segmentation. Extensive ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of our modules, while comprehensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate HRSeg's superior performance.

we propose a deep learning framework that integrates anatomical priors,
including joint constraints and natural head rotation ranges, into the loss
function design. We validate NeckSense on 7 participants using the current SOTA
pose estimation model as ground truth. Our system achieves a mean per-vertex
error of 25.9 mm across various head movements with a leave-one-person-out
cross-validation method, demonstrating that a compact, line-of-sight-free
bio-impedance wearable can deliver head-tracking performance comparable to SOTA
vision-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于摄像头、用户无感知的情绪识别方法，结合注视模式与环境语义及时序动态，实现实时、连续的情绪识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式信号（如面部表情、语音或手势），容易掩盖且无法捕捉深层情绪；生理信号方法需复杂传感器，影响自然行为；注视分析方法静态且忽略环境交互。

Method: 利用标准高清摄像头捕捉用户眼部外观和头部运动，估计时空注视轨迹，建模注视行为的空间、语义和时序维度。

Result: 揭示了情绪是人与环境互动的复杂结果，而非单纯生理反应，实现了高通用性和低部署成本的情绪识别。

Conclusion: 该方法无需专用硬件或用户主动参与，实现了用户无感知、实时、连续的情绪识别。

Abstract: Emotion recognition,as a step toward mind reading,seeks to infer internal
states from external cues.Most existing methods rely on explicit signals-such
as facial expressions,speech,or gestures-that reflect only bodily responses and
overlook the influence of environmental context.These cues are often
voluntary,easy to mask,and insufficient for capturing deeper,implicit emotions.
Physiological signal-based approaches offer more direct access to internal
states but require complex sensors that compromise natural behavior and limit
scalability.Gaze-based methods typically rely on static fixation analysis and
fail to capture the rich,dynamic interactions between gaze and the
environment,and thus cannot uncover the deep connection between emotion and
implicit behavior.To address these limitations,we propose a novel
camera-based,user-unaware emotion recognition approach that integrates gaze
fixation patterns with environmental semantics and temporal dynamics.Leveraging
standard HD cameras,our method unobtrusively captures users'eye appearance and
head movements in natural settings-without the need for specialized hardware or
active user participation.From these visual cues,the system estimates gaze
trajectories over time and space, providing the basis for modeling the spatial,
semantic,and temporal dimensions of gaze behavior. This allows us to capture
the dynamic interplay between visual attention and the surrounding
environment,revealing that emotions are not merely physiological responses but
complex outcomes of human-environment interactions.The proposed approach
enables user-unaware,real-time,and continuous emotion recognition,offering high
generalizability and low deployment cost.

*Yin Wu,Daniel Slieter,Ahmed Abouelazm,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的车道性能估计框架（LanePerf），通过整合图像和车道特征，解决了车道检测中性能估计的挑战，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道检测在ADAS和ADS中至关重要，但域偏移会降低模型可靠性。传统方法需要大量标注数据，而本文探索了无标签的性能估计方法。

Method: 本文首先将五种图像分类的性能估计方法适配到车道检测任务中，然后提出LanePerf框架，结合预训练图像编码器和DeepSets架构，处理零车道检测和大域偏移情况。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上的实验表明，LanePerf的MAE为0.117，Spearman相关系数为0.727，优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: LanePerf为ADAS中的无标签性能估计提供了高效解决方案，支持在复杂驾驶场景中更安全的测试。

Abstract: Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems
(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial
information for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model
reliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and
safety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating
target domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance
without ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient
robustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While
previous work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,
these methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper
first adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image
classification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the
limitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane
features, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework
(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image
encoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane
detection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the
OpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),
demonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE
of 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These
findings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,
supporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习是一种隐私保护的协作学习范式，但缺乏专门的数据集。本文旨在填补这一空白，并提出更高效的算法。

Method: 提出两种新算法：Fed-Cyclic（循环拓扑）和Fed-Star（星形拓扑），分别通过局部训练和预聚合优化模型权重。

Result: 实验证明两种算法在新数据集上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 本文为联邦学习提供了专用数据集和高效算法，推动了隐私保护机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to learn a global model without exposing their data to each
other. Consequently, it provides a secure learning platform with
privacy-preserving capabilities. This paper introduces a new dataset containing
23,326 images collected from eight different commercial sources and classified
into 31 categories, similar to the Office-31 dataset. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first image classification dataset specifically designed
for Federated Learning. We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,
namely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from
its previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to
the next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives
weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through
pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and
sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like
topology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than
existing baselines on our newly introduced dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体育分析中缺乏真实运动数据集和单目3D姿态估计可靠性不明确的问题。

Method: 创建AthleticsPose数据集，训练3D姿态估计模型，并进行全面评估。

Result: 模型在AthleticsPose上训练后，MPJPE降低约75%，但对相机视角和主体尺度敏感。

Conclusion: 真实运动数据对模型性能至关重要，但模型在高速指标上存在局限性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is a promising, flexible alternative to costly
motion capture systems for sports analysis. However, its practical application
is hindered by two factors: a lack of realistic sports datasets and unclear
reliability for sports tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the
AthleticsPose dataset, a new public dataset featuring ``real'' motions captured
from 23 athletes performing various athletics events on an athletic field.
Using this dataset, we trained a representative 3D pose estimation model and
performed a comprehensive evaluation. Our results show that the model trained
on AthleticsPose significantly outperforms a baseline model trained on an
imitated sports motion dataset, reducing MPJPE by approximately 75 %. These
results show the importance of training on authentic sports motion data, as
models based on imitated motions do not effectively transfer to real-world
motions. Further analysis reveals that estimation accuracy is sensitive to
camera view and subject scale. In case studies of kinematic indicators, the
model demonstrated the potential to capture individual differences in knee
angles but struggled with higher-speed metrics, such as knee-drive velocity,
due to prediction biases. This work provides the research community with a
valuable dataset and clarifies the potential and practical limitations of using
monocular 3D pose estimation for sports motion analysis. Our dataset, code, and
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云重建方法存在信息丢失问题，如纹理缺失或复杂结构导致的细节失真，而多视角图像能提供更详细的场景表示。

Method: 提出Argus框架，融合多视角图像和相机姿态生成场景特征，与3D特征交互，形成全面的3D感知嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，Argus在多种下游任务中优于现有3D-LMMs。

Conclusion: Argus通过多模态输入扩展了LLMs的3D任务能力，有效解决了3D点云重建中的信息损失问题。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct
applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed
a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling
tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point
clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results
in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone
to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.
Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of
details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense
reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency
with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene
components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on
these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that
leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In
general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model
(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D
multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to
tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and
camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features
to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach
compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and
helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DMQ方法，结合LES和PTS，有效解决扩散模型量化中的性能退化问题，尤其在低比特宽度下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型计算成本高，现有量化方法忽略异常值，导致低比特宽度下性能下降。

Method: 结合LES优化通道缩放因子，引入PTS处理高方差通道，并采用自适应时间步加权和投票算法。

Result: 在W4A6和W4A8等低比特宽度下显著优于现有方法，保持高质量图像生成。

Conclusion: DMQ通过LES和PTS有效提升量化性能，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative
nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,
leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a
DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise
Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned
Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute
quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall
quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having
small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error
accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to
prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that
layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we
introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust
selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting
algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths
such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image
generation quality and model stability. The code is available at

online an offline data augmentation to tackle the imbalanced data, a backbone
EfficientNet\_Large deep learning model for extracting robust embedding
features, and a post-processing SVM classifier to balance and enhance the
classification performance. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.8938
on the public test set of the Zindi challenge.

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了跨模态身份识别能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督下有效提取模态不变特征，提升跨模态行人重识别性能。

Abstract: To reduce the reliance of visible-infrared person re-identification (ReID)
models on labeled cross-modal samples, this paper explores a weakly supervised
cross-modal person ReID method that uses only single-modal sample identity
labels, addressing scenarios where cross-modal identity labels are unavailable.
To mitigate the impact of missing cross-modal labels on model performance, we
propose a heterogeneous expert collaborative consistency learning framework,
designed to establish robust cross-modal identity correspondences in a weakly
supervised manner. This framework leverages labeled data from each modality to
independently train dedicated classification experts. To associate cross-modal
samples, these classification experts act as heterogeneous predictors,
predicting the identities of samples from the other modality. To improve
prediction accuracy, we design a cross-modal relationship fusion mechanism that
effectively integrates predictions from different experts. Under the implicit
supervision provided by cross-modal identity correspondences, collaborative and
consistent learning among the experts is encouraged, significantly enhancing
the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features and improve
cross-modal identity recognition. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: MUPM通过学习不确定性关系，为临床应用中不确定性估计和分析提供了实用工具，尤其在心脏疾病预测任务中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can process and integrate
information from multimodality sources, such as text and images. However,
interrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual
uni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an
uncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of
large-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty
propagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the
relationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and
joint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting
of cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be
optimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are
generalisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps
surprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be
explained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,
along with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this
learned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these
uncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may
be estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of
cardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the
efficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty
and its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered
practical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are
available at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.

Result: 实验验证了LoViC在预测、回溯、插值和多镜头生成等任务中的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LoViC通过统一范式实现了长视频的高效生成，同时保持时间一致性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) for text-to-video
generation, scaling to long-duration content remains challenging due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. While prior efforts -- such as sparse
attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they
often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a
DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to
produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the
core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly
compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports
variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a
single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by
encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model
seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot
generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）通常使用过多的视觉令牌，而实际场景中多数任务并不需要如此高的分辨率。

Method: 采用动态分辨率处理，结合强化学习和LLM-as-Judge策略，设计奖励函数和惩罚机制。

Result: 在OCR任务中表现优异，同时在简单任务中大幅节省视觉令牌。

Conclusion: VisionThink在效率和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于广泛视觉问答任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved
performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often
significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world
scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the
performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models
still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4
resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with
different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,
namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides
whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output
a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing
Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or
thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by
case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding
capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens
on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge
strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully
design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and
reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available

Motivation: 传统可变形图像配准（DIR）中，正则化参数调整计算成本高，需要多次训练迭代。

Method: 提出cIDIR框架，利用INRs条件化正则化超参数，通过分割掩码优化超参数，并建模连续可微的变形向量场（DVF）。

Result: 在DIR-LAB数据集上评估，cIDIR表现出高精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: cIDIR通过条件化正则化超参数和连续可微的DVF建模，显著提升了DIR的效率和性能。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deformable image registration (DIR) to ensure
that the estimated Deformation Vector Field (DVF) remains smooth, physically
plausible, and anatomically consistent. However, fine-tuning regularization
parameters in learning-based DIR frameworks is computationally expensive, often
requiring multiple training iterations. To address this, we propose cIDI, a
novel DIR framework based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that
conditions the registration process on regularization hyperparameters. Unlike
conventional methods that require retraining for each regularization
hyperparameter setting, cIDIR is trained over a prior distribution of these
hyperparameters, then optimized over the regularization hyperparameters by
using the segmentations masks as an observation. Additionally, cIDIR models a
continuous and differentiable DVF, enabling seamless integration of advanced
regularization techniques via automatic differentiation. Evaluated on the
DIR-LAB dataset, $\operatorname{cIDIR}$ achieves high accuracy and robustness
across the dataset.

Conclusion: FantasyPortrait为高保真、情感丰富的面部动画生成提供了有效解决方案，并推动了多人动画研究的发展。

Abstract: Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging
task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial
landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and
struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack
support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different
individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To
address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer
based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations
for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an
expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations
to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to
render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked
cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression
generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in
this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are
specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating
multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in
challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts. Our project page is

Conclusion: 细粒度策略和元数据融合能有效提升手腕病理诊断的准确性，尤其在数据有限时。

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who
constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions
is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents
a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a
notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one
modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse
and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to
address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely
limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained
recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional
CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient
metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a
coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a
fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical
domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show
that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic
accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger
fracture-focused dataset.

Conclusion: 通过分离不可观测特征并利用RGB预训练模型的空间知识，ULDM能够高效学习光谱-空间联合分布，显著提升了重建性能。

Abstract: Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that
requires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB
images. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which
encapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging
sensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial
joint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable
feature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding
RGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB
pre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this
end, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an
unobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding
spatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can
focus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable
feature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers
the ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.
Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure
representation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to
transform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral
unobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress
the unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the
second stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by
the SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the
distribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the
corresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting
tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 大型模型（如Vision Transformers）的训练成本高，部署时面临延迟、计算和内存挑战。现有结构化剪枝方法需要昂贵重训练。

Method: 通过收集激活统计数据选择剪枝神经元，同时将平均激活集成回模型以保持性能。

Conclusion: Variance-Based Pruning是一种高效的一步剪枝技术，显著减少资源需求且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Increasingly expensive training of ever larger models such as Vision
Transfomers motivate reusing the vast library of already trained
state-of-the-art networks. However, their latency, high computational costs and
memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on
resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce
these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to
hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy
resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided
performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding
extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce
Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for
efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first
gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning.
Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to
preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we
demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its
original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99%
of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model
size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.

Conclusion: DISSect通过差分信息有效解决了噪声对应问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: The remarkable success of contrastive-learning-based multimodal models has
been greatly driven by training on ever-larger datasets with expensive compute
consumption. Sample selection as an alternative efficient paradigm plays an
important direction to accelerate the training process. However, recent
advances on sample selection either mostly rely on an oracle model to offline
select a high-quality coreset, which is limited in the cold-start scenarios, or
focus on online selection based on real-time model predictions, which has not
sufficiently or efficiently considered the noisy correspondence. To address
this dilemma, we propose a novel Differential-Informed Sample Selection
(DISSect) method, which accurately and efficiently discriminates the noisy
correspondence for training acceleration. Specifically, we rethink the impact
of noisy correspondence on contrastive learning and propose that the
differential between the predicted correlation of the current model and that of
a historical model is more informative to characterize sample quality. Based on
this, we construct a robust differential-based sample selection and analyze its
theoretical insights. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and
various downstream tasks demonstrate the consistent superiority of DISSect over
current state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at:

Motivation: 解决传统图像篡改定位方法依赖大量像素级标注的问题，探索涂鸦标注作为弱监督信号以提高标注效率和检测性能。

Method: 提出涂鸦标注的IML数据集（Sc-IML）和框架，包括自监督训练、先验感知特征调制模块（PFMM）、门控自适应融合模块（GAFM）和置信感知熵最小化损失（${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在分布内和分布外数据上的平均性能优于现有全监督方法。

Conclusion: 涂鸦标注是一种高效的弱监督形式，结合提出的框架可显著提升图像篡改定位的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image manipulation localization (IML) methods have
achieved remarkable performance in recent years, but typically rely on
large-scale pixel-level annotated datasets. To address the challenge of
acquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods
utilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the
performance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this
study, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation
efficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.
We re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the
first scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first
scribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ
self-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the
model to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.
In addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that
adaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic
regions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature
discriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose
a gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to
regulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward
emphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware
entropy minimization loss (${\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically
regularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model
uncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches
in terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have made notable progress in image generation,
with Masked AutoRegressive (MAR) models gaining attention for their efficient
parallel decoding. However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when
compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to
improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image
tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an
improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with
bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our
advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves
a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet
256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256
steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with
775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond
image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable
real-time speech-to-image conversion. Our codes and models are available at

Abstract: Scene understanding is one of the core tasks in computer vision, aiming to
extract semantic information from images to identify objects, scene categories,
and their interrelationships. Although advancements in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have driven progress in this field, existing VLMs still face challenges
in adaptation to unseen complex wide-area scenes. To address the challenges,
this paper proposes a Hierarchical Coresets Selection (HCS) mechanism to
advance the adaptation of VLMs in complex wide-area scene understanding. It
progressively refines the selected regions based on the proposed theoretically
guaranteed importance function, which considers utility, representativeness,
robustness, and synergy. Without requiring additional fine-tuning, HCS enables
VLMs to achieve rapid understandings of unseen scenes at any scale using
minimal interpretable regions while mitigating insufficient feature density.
HCS is a plug-and-play method that is compatible with any VLM. Experiments
demonstrate that HCS achieves superior performance and universality in various
tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的检测器引导框架有效提升了数据集蒸馏的质量和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact yet informative dataset
that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset, thereby reducing
demands on storage and computational resources. Although diffusion models have
made significant progress in dataset distillation, the generated surrogate
datasets often contain samples with label inconsistencies or insufficient
structural detail, leading to suboptimal downstream performance. To address
these issues, we propose a detector-guided dataset distillation framework that
explicitly leverages a pre-trained detector to identify and refine anomalous
synthetic samples, thereby ensuring label consistency and improving image
quality. Specifically, a detector model trained on the original dataset is
employed to identify anomalous images exhibiting label mismatches or low
classification confidence. For each defective image, multiple candidates are
generated using a pre-trained diffusion model conditioned on the corresponding
image prototype and label. The optimal candidate is then selected by jointly
considering the detector's confidence score and dissimilarity to existing
qualified synthetic samples, thereby ensuring both label accuracy and
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can
synthesize high-quality representative images with richer details, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on the validation set.

Abstract: For safety-critical robotics applications such as autonomous driving, it is
important to detect all required objects accurately in real-time. Motion
segmentation offers a solution by identifying dynamic objects from the scene in
a class-agnostic manner. Recently, various motion segmentation models have been
proposed, most of which jointly use subnetworks to estimate Depth, Pose,
Optical Flow, and Scene Flow. As a result, the overall computational cost of
the model increases, hindering real-time performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel cost-volume-based motion feature
representation, Channel-wise Motion Features. By extracting depth features of
each instance in the feature map and capturing the scene's 3D motion
information, it offers enhanced efficiency. The only subnetwork used to build
Channel-wise Motion Features is the Pose Network, and no others are required.
Our method not only achieves about 4 times the FPS of state-of-the-art models
in the KITTI Dataset and Cityscapes of the VCAS-Motion Dataset, but also
demonstrates equivalent accuracy while reducing the parameters to about 25$\%$.

Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）任务因缺乏未知对象的标注而极具挑战性，现有方法依赖伪标签，而PROB模型虽无需伪标签但存在学习冲突问题。

Method: 提出Decoupled PROB，引入ETOP终止对象性预测，并设计TDQI模块高效提取已知和未知对象的特征。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，Decoupled PROB性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Decoupled PROB通过解耦学习冲突和优化特征提取，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging computer vision task that
extends standard object detection by (1) detecting and classifying unknown
objects without supervision, and (2) incrementally learning new object classes
without forgetting previously learned ones. The absence of ground truths for
unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have
addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently
proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)
is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown
objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces
issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.
  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel
model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of
Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate
layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and
objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query
Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown
objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method
that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that
can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive
experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all
existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.

Conclusion: DiffOSeg能同时实现共识和偏好驱动的分割，为医学图像分割提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image
segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical
expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic
segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although
recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods
typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic
``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus
struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a
two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both
consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven
(reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes
population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II
captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two
public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics. Source code is available

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, show impressive zero-shot
recognition ability and can be easily transferred to specific downstream tasks
via prompt tuning, even with limited training data. However, existing prompt
tuning methods face two main challenges: (1) In few-shot scenarios, data
scarcity often leads to overfitting, making the model sensitive to changes in
the input domain. (2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on
complex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,
severely restricting their general applicability. To address these issues, we
propose a simpler and more general framework called GLAD (Generalizable LoRA
tuning with RegulArized GraDient). We show that merely applying LoRA achieves
performance in downstream tasks comparable to current state-of-the-art
prompt-based methods. While LoRA is effective and easy to use, it remains
susceptible to overfitting in few-shot learning scenarios. To mitigate this
risk, we introduce a gradient-based regularization technique. This technique
effectively steers the optimization trajectory, encouraging the model to find a
more stable parameter region that is robust to variations in data distribution.
Through extensive experiments conducted on 15 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that GLAD outperforms previous tuning approaches in terms of
base-to-novel class generalization, image domain generalization, and
cross-dataset generalization. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Fetal lung maturity is a critical indicator for predicting neonatal outcomes
and the need for post-natal intervention, especially for pregnancies affected
by fetal growth restriction. Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown
promising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but
its reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its
clinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity
evaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that
consists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a
model-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on
manually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D
diffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust
performance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model
fitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung
segmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and
perfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows
that a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity
assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Enabling large-scale generative models to continuously learn new visual
concepts is essential for personalizing pre-trained models to meet individual
user preferences. Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are
constrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and
parameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of
Experts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept
learning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter
overhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we
propose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism
that enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the
gating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating
redundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by
fully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical
local attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between
generated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our
method generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\% reduction in
forgetting rates and 63.3\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.

Abstract: High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle
structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and
irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational
cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing
localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based
anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with
cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization.
Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal
prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a
local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is
computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each
cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided
strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as
centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions,
enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive
experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level
anomaly detection, even using only raw features.

Abstract: IRSTD (InfraRed Small Target Detection) detects small targets in infrared

and datasets have led to significant advancements, they are limited by their
reliance solely on the image modality. Recent advances in deep learning and
large vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various
visual recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal IRSTD
framework that incorporates language priors to guide small target detection. We
leverage language-guided attention weights derived from the language prior to
enhance the model's ability for IRSTD, presenting a novel approach that
combines textual information with image data to improve IRSTD capabilities.
Utilizing the state-of-the-art GPT-4 vision model, we generate text
descriptions that provide the locations of small targets in infrared images,
employing careful prompt engineering to ensure improved accuracy. Due to the
absence of multimodal IR datasets, existing IRSTD methods rely solely on image
data. To address this shortcoming, we have curated a multimodal infrared
dataset that includes both image and text modalities for small target
detection, expanding upon the popular IRSTD-1k and NUDT-SIRST datasets. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments and
comprehensive ablation studies. The results demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art method, with relative percentage
differences of 9.74%, 13.02%, 1.25%, and 67.87% in IoU, nIoU, Pd, and Fa on the
NUAA-SIRST subset, and 4.41%, 2.04%, 2.01%, and 113.43% on the IRSTD-1k subset
of the LangIR dataset, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-TinyNet是一种针对遥感图像中小目标检测的多阶段特征融合与增强模型，通过新颖的微小目标显著性建模和特征完整性重建设计，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的微小目标由于空间信息有限、特征表示弱且分布密集，检测难度大，现有检测器表现不佳。

Method: 设计了多维度协作注意力模块（MDCA）、辅助可逆分支（ARB）和渐进融合检测头（PFDH），以增强目标显著性和保留信息流。

Result: 在AI-TOD数据集上AP提升4.0%，AP75提升6.5%，DIOR数据集验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: 多阶段特征融合策略为复杂遥感环境中的微小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a
long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,
weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex
backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still
underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a
multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS
tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel
designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.
Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement
modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)
module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny
objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive
fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow
and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural
detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our
RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and
6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior
detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that
the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and
practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

Motivation: 解决基于学习的单目视觉里程计在鲁棒性、泛化性和效率方面的挑战，尤其是DINOv2模型在VO中应用受限的问题。

Method: 提出一种针对DINOv2粗糙特征的关键点检测器，结合几何特征，并使用基于Transformer的匹配器和可微分姿态估计层。

Result: DINO-VO在TartanAir和KITTI数据集上表现优于现有方法，运行效率高（72 FPS），内存占用低（<1GB）。

Conclusion: DINO-VO展示了在复杂环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，性能接近视觉SLAM系统。

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness,
generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in
visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and
generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains
limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a
feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its
sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a
salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,
we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric
features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a
transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable
precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior
detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater
robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy
and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone
DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on
the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while
running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single
GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor
driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的视觉语言导航方法受限于固定知识库和推理能力，无法有效整合经验知识，缺乏进化能力。

Method: SE-VLN包含三个核心模块：分层记忆模块（存储成功与失败案例）、检索增强推理模块（多步决策）和反思模块（持续进化）。

Result: 在未见环境中，SE-VLN的导航成功率分别达到57%和35.2%，比现有方法提升了23.9%和15.0%。

Conclusion: SE-VLN展示了作为自进化代理框架的巨大潜力，其性能随经验库增长而提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to
emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent
generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.
However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning
abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and
thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,
we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and
proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the
ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it
was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework
was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a
hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into
reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to
retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection
module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the
SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen
environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%
over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,
respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with
increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a
self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Result: 模型性能优越，参数少（469M），训练数据少（280h视频），在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 连续自回归模型优于离散模型，鲁棒性更强，性能更优。

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon
generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we
develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision
or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model
yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and
being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult
scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete
token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow
matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with
both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes
in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on
individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete
tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially
enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity
and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a
novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection,
leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails
generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000
different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These
images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation
on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model
attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively.
Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic
dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds.
These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in
addressing DNN training data scarcity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频质量的提升，检测这类内容对打击虚假信息、保护隐私和安全至关重要。现有方法主要针对DeepFakes，而视频生成技术已超越此范围，亟需通用检测方法。

Result: 在包含10,000个AI生成视频和4,000个真实视频的数据集上，平均检测准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，计划公开代码、模型和数据集以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements
in the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content
becomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of
detecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,
ensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been
substantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for
video detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human
faces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,
creating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos
with generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that
leverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated
videos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been
trained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can
help distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we
achieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,
and we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification
layer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we
compiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced
by 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling
over 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves
high detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.
Upon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,
and our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追求一个无需数据集特定微调、能在不同分辨率和视差范围内泛化的立体匹配模型，揭示了局部搜索方法与全局匹配架构之间的根本性权衡。

Method: 设计了$S^2M^2$架构，结合多分辨率变换器实现长距离对应，并通过新颖的损失函数集中概率于可行匹配，同时估计视差、遮挡和置信度。

Result: 在Middlebury v3和ETH3D基准测试中达到最新技术水平，显著优于先前方法，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: $S^2M^2$成功解决了全局匹配架构的计算和内存成本问题，实现了高精度和高效率的立体匹配。

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing
across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific
fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search
methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism
inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On
the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust,
have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and
memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching
architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency
without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design
integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence,
trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible
matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity,
occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the
Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods
across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive
efficiency.

TL;DR: VITA是一种视觉到动作的流匹配策略，通过将潜在视觉表示转化为潜在动作来优化视觉运动控制，简化了传统方法中的条件机制，提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配和扩散策略需要额外的条件机制（如交叉注意力）来生成动作，增加了时间和空间开销。VITA旨在消除这些模块，同时保留生成建模能力。

Method: VITA将潜在图像作为流源，通过自编码器创建结构化的动作潜在空间，并通过流匹配和动作重建损失进行端到端学习。

Result: 在ALOHA平台的双臂操作任务中，VITA表现优于或匹配现有生成策略，并将推理延迟降低了50-130%。

Conclusion: VITA是首个仅使用MLP的流匹配策略，能够解决复杂的双臂操作任务，展示了其高效性和简单性。

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Motivation: 观察到预训练主干权重矩阵中的向量具有近似正交性，而低秩适应矩阵（如LoRA和Adapter）缺乏这一特性。近似正交性可以降低模型泛化误差的上界，从而提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出AOFT策略，使用单个可学习向量生成一组近似正交向量，构建低秩适应矩阵，使其与主干矩阵的性质一致。

Result: 实验结果表明，AOFT在多个下游图像分类任务中表现优异，验证了其增强泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: AOFT通过近似正交性提升了低秩适应矩阵的泛化能力，为视觉变换器的参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained
Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone
parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to
accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived
through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection
matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we
observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within
any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent
in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality
implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,
signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the
fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as
the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of
fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an
Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the
low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to
generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the
down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices
with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image
classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization
capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

Result: 在数字模拟和真实化妆图像上，年龄验证准确率提升4.8%，面部识别性能提升8.9%。

Conclusion: DiffClean有效防御化妆攻击，提升年龄和身份验证的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate age verification can protect underage users from unauthorized access
to online platforms and e-commerce sites that provide age-restricted services.
However, accurate age estimation can be confounded by several factors,
including facial makeup that can induce changes to alter perceived identity and
age to fool both humans and machines. In this work, we propose DiffClean which
erases makeup traces using a text-guided diffusion model to defend against
makeup attacks. DiffClean improves age estimation (minor vs. adult accuracy by
4.8%) and face verification (TMR by 8.9% at FMR=0.01%) over competing baselines
on digitally simulated and real makeup images.

Abstract: Realistic and controllable garment visualization is critical for fashion
e-commerce, where users expect personalized previews under diverse poses and
lighting conditions. Existing methods often rely on predefined poses, limiting
semantic flexibility and illumination adaptability. To address this, we
introduce FashionPose, the first unified text-to-pose-to-relighting generation
framework. Given a natural language description, our method first predicts a 2D
human pose, then employs a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity person

same textual input. By replacing explicit pose annotations with text-driven
conditioning, FashionPose enables accurate pose alignment, faithful garment

pose synthesis and efficient, consistent relighting, providing a practical
solution for personalized virtual fashion display.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely
adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and
benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative
evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from
those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and
error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT)
annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our
analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including
significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and
ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations
across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance
reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous
visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an
open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and
facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、实时的交互检测，适用于流式视觉场景。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time
applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate
detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient
approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric
vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action
recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active
objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as
backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark
at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object.
We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition
and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition
predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in
turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active
object.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video
generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for
resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even
more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to
significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on
mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder
(VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual
quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning
strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving
critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step
distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number

Conclusion: 滑动迭代去噪有效提升4D一致性，生成高质量新视角视频。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans
with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of
insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos
at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack
spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this
paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the
spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define
a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human
pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the
latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and
finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised
latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across
the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field
and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory
consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ
datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and
consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing
approaches. See our project page for interactive demos and video results:

Result: 在提出的新基准Inert-CompBench和两个公共测试集上，方法显著提升了基线模型的概念响应能力，结果极具竞争力。

Conclusion: IMBA损失函数有效解决了复杂概念响应不稳定的问题，方法简单高效，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex
concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an
under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors
for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also
design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this
issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset
processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex
concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method
significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and
yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPartGen是一个自回归模型，用于生成由3D部件组成的对象，支持多种输入（图像、2D掩码或现有3D对象），并能自动确定部件类型和数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型在部件组合性和生成灵活性方面存在不足，AutoPartGen旨在通过自回归方式解决这些问题。

Method: 基于3DShape2VecSet的潜在空间，模型自回归生成部件，每次预测一个部件并基于先前生成的部件和其他输入（如图像或3D对象）进行条件生成。

Result: AutoPartGen在3D部件生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，生成的部件可无缝组装成完整对象。

Conclusion: AutoPartGen展示了强大的部件生成能力，为3D对象的组合生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts
in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an
object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate
a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon
3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric
expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional
properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks.
Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting
one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and
additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process
continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus
determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can
be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring
additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation
capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen,
demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part
generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel
approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a
conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their
reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to
instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$
employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict
affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any
reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input
ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free
approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks,
including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense
point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.

Result: 在合成和图像数据上验证了小批量耦合的有效性，展示了其优势。

Conclusion: 小批量耦合能够有效提升层次化流匹配的性能，适用于多模态数据建模。

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that
is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward
integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality
that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was
recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically
integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the
multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of
modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model
multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution
remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how
to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels
of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch
couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on
synthetic and imaging data. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VideoITG的方法，通过用户指令定制视频帧采样，显著提升了视频大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中难以处理复杂场景，需要一种更有效的方式选择信息丰富的视频帧。

Method: 提出VidThinker管道，通过指令生成详细剪辑级标题、检索相关视频片段并进行精细帧选择。构建VideoITG-40K数据集，设计即插即用的VideoITG模型。

Result: VideoITG在多模态视频理解基准测试中表现优异，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: VideoITG在视频理解领域具有优越性和巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video
frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,
employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing
temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt
unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex
scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding
for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user
instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated
annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.
First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the
instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through
instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection
to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we
construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed
temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,
which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities
of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.
Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements
across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its
superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PaPIS的病理感知图像相似性评估方法，用于虚拟染色技术的评估，优于传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如FR-IQA）和专家评审难以准确捕捉病理相关特征，需开发更专业的评估工具。

Method: PaPIS结合深度学习特征和Retinex分解，专注于细胞形态和病理感知质量。

Result: PaPIS能更准确反映病理视觉线索，提升虚拟染色模型的性能。

Conclusion: 病理感知评估框架对虚拟染色技术的发展至关重要。

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation
frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual
staining technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期筛查眼病对全球数百万人至关重要，但在资源有限地区难以实现。InSight旨在通过AI技术提升筛查的可及性和准确性。

Method: InSight采用三阶段流程：实时图像质量评估、疾病诊断模型和DR分级模型。其创新包括多模态融合（MetaFusion）、监督与自监督预训练方法，以及多任务模型。

Result: 图像质量检查器准确率近100%，多模态疾病诊断模型在平衡准确率上优于仅使用图像的模型（BRSET提升6%，mBRSET提升4%）。

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）因缺乏参考图像和标记数据有限而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖大规模预训练。

Method: 构建自定义数据集，结合内容和质量特征，采用对比三元组学习方法训练模型。

Result: 模型在公开数据集上表现出强泛化能力，且训练样本需求较少。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了NR-IQA中的数据限制问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to

transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Motivation: 解决现有DDPMs在健康组织修复中采样速度慢的问题，同时保持高质量的修复效果。

Method: 结合DDPMs与GANs，采用方差保持噪声调度，并应用于3D小波扩散模型（WDM3D），无需对抗训练。

Result: fastWDM3D在BraTS测试集上SSIM为0.8571，MSE为0.0079，PSNR为22.26，仅需2个时间步，速度比其他DDPMs快800倍。

Conclusion: fastWDM3D是一种快速且准确的健康组织修复方法，具有显著的速度优势和高性能指标。

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

TL;DR: SpectraLift是一种自监督框架，通过融合低分辨率高光谱图像（LR-HSI）和高分辨率多光谱图像（HR-MSI），无需PSF校准或真实高分辨率HSI，即可恢复高空间分辨率的高光谱图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率高光谱图像（HSI）在遥感和医学成像中至关重要，但现有方法通常需要不切实际的PSF校准或真实高分辨率HSI数据。

Method: SpectraLift利用多光谱图像的SRF，通过轻量级MLP网络，以合成低分辨率多光谱图像（LR-MSI）为输入，LR-HSI为输出，使用L1光谱重建损失进行优化。

Result: SpectraLift在PSNR、SAM、SSIM和RMSE等指标上优于现有方法，且收敛速度快，对空间模糊和分辨率不敏感。

Conclusion: SpectraLift提供了一种高效、自监督的HSI-MSI融合方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

### [137] [From Roots to Rewards: Dynamic Tree Reasoning with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13142)
*Ahmed Bahloul,Simon Malberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态强化学习框架，改进静态树状推理方法，提升问题解答的适应性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有树状推理方法（如ProbTree）存在静态结构和计算效率低的问题，无法动态适应中间结果。

Method: 采用动态强化学习框架，实时构建推理树并学习最优策略，选择性扩展和资源分配。

Result: 新方法在保持概率严谨性的同时，提高了解答质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为树状推理提供了新范式，平衡了概率框架的可靠性和实际问答系统的灵活性。

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al.,
2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration.
Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic
Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues
by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers
through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge
(Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two
key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial
construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and
(2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution
strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic
reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms
tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally
constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while
learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or
aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving
both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion
and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for
treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic
frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering
systems.

### [138] [The Generative Energy Arena (GEA): Incorporating Energy Awareness in Large Language Model (LLM) Human Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13302)
*Carlos Arriaga,Gonzalo Martínez,Eneko Sendin,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GEA（Generative Energy Arena）的新方法，通过公开竞技场让用户评估大型语言模型（LLMs），同时考虑模型的能耗信息。初步结果显示，用户倾向于选择更节能的小型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM的方法（如自动化基准测试和人工评估）存在局限性，前者与人类评价相关性低，后者难以扩展且成本高。此外，模型的能耗问题日益重要，但传统方法未考虑能耗对用户选择的影响。

Method: 提出GEA，一个公开竞技场平台，用户可以在评估模型时看到其能耗信息，并据此选择模型。通过收集用户反馈，生成模型排名。

Result: 初步结果显示，用户在了解能耗信息后，更倾向于选择小型、节能的模型，而非性能更高但能耗更大的模型。

Conclusion: GEA提供了一种可扩展且考虑能耗的LLM评估方法，表明用户更重视节能而非性能提升，为未来模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several
approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated
benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different
topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most
concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is
to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a
large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and
costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators
and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is
the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can
freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.
The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important
aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how
energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of
interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena
that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the
evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,
showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy
consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests
that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more
complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived
quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Conclusion: 提出的技术显著提升了小语言模型的性能，并公开了模型以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1
and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through
chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial
improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These
breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL),
particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide
objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects
of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse
set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for
effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements
to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to
improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL
regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as
critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model
achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on
math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate
continued research, we release our model publicly.

approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal
learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review
representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and
temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with
clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation
models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream
reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability,
clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This
survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR
modeling and clinical decision support. For a comprehensive list of EHR-related

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于并行多知识学习的无损压缩器（PMKLC），通过四种关键设计解决了现有学习型压缩器在压缩比、吞吐量和鲁棒性上的不足，并在实验中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型无损压缩器在压缩比、吞吐量和鲁棒性方面存在不足，限制了其在基因组数据库备份、存储和传输中的广泛应用。

Method: 1) 提出自动化多知识学习框架；2) 设计GPU加速的(s,k)-mer编码器；3) 引入数据块分区和逐步模型传递机制；4) 设计两种压缩模式（PMKLC-S和PMKLC-M）以适应不同场景。

Result: PMKLC-S/M在15个真实数据集上平均压缩比提升达73.609%和73.480%，吞吐量提升达3.036倍和10.710倍，并表现出最佳鲁棒性和内存效率。

Conclusion: PMKLC在压缩性能、吞吐量和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法，适用于不同场景和资源受限设备。

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale
genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their
1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression
throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption
and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we
propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge
\underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial
designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression
framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness;
2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression
throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block
partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel
acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet
the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a
resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We
benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15
real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to
baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression
ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput
improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides,
PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost,
indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability
distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained
devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARES是一种新的概率框架，通过仅基于已验证的前提判断每个主张，有效检测LLM推理链中的传播错误，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM错误检测方法未能有效处理传播错误，导致最终结论不可靠。

Method: 提出Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES)框架，基于已验证前提逐步判断主张，提供统计保证。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现最佳（72.1% Macro-F1，提升8.2点），在长推理链中检测传播错误效果显著（90.3% F1，提升27.6点）。

Conclusion: ARES通过概率框架有效减少推理链中的错误传播，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors
often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current
LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors
because they do not properly account for how earlier errors might corrupt
judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such propagated errors, we
introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a novel
probabilistic framework that prevents error propagation by judging each claim
based only on previously-assessed sound premises. This inductive method yields
a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of
its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2
points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning
chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6
points).

Motivation: 解决稀疏自编码器在训练语料中未广泛出现的领域特定特征捕捉不足的问题。

Method: 训练一个次级SAE来建模预训练SAE在领域特定文本上的重构误差，通过叠加两个模型的输出来提升性能。

Result: 在多领域任务中显著提升了LLM的交叉熵和解释方差指标，同时保持通用任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为选择性增强SAE在特定领域的可解释性提供了新途径，推动了LLM的针对性机制解释研究。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the
internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to
capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This
paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature
blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a
secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained
SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the
primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we
demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained
variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that
this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs
while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables
researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of
interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability
of LLMs.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a
fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable,
controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning
models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of
reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased
research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the
lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions
between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL
tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward
models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of
this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to
provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine
recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and
opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological
considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks,
evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and
inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on
sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions.
By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured

Conclusion: 跨模态对齐的样本选择推动了数据为中心的学习，提升了效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern deep models are trained on large real-world datasets, where data
quality varies and redundancy is common. Data-centric approaches such as
dataset pruning have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model
performance. However, most existing methods rely on static heuristics or
task-specific metrics, limiting their robustness and generalizability across
domains. In this work, we introduce a dynamic dataset pruning framework that
adaptively selects training samples based on both task-driven difficulty and
cross-modality semantic consistency. By incorporating supervision from
pretrained multimodal foundation models, our approach captures training
dynamics while effectively filtering out uninformative samples. Our work
highlights the potential of integrating cross-modality alignment for robust
sample selection, advancing data-centric learning toward more efficient and
robust practices across application domains.

Result: 在铁路轨道刚度估计案例中，模型显著优于现有方法，实现了高分辨率、自动化的健康评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为基础设施健康监测提供了准确、局部化和全自动的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based framework for infrastructure
health monitoring using drive-by vibration response signals. Recognizing the
importance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the
WaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor
utilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting
vibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early
network layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract
multi-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration
signal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network
effectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement
speeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal
dependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors
for health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a
sequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,
capturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.
This architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of
infrastructure health conditions. A case study focusing on railway track
stiffness estimation with simulated drive-by vibration signals shows that the
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating railway
ballast and railpad stiffness parameters. Results underscore the potential of
this approach for accurate, localized, and fully automated drive-by
infrastructure health monitoring.

Abstract: Designing effective neural networks is a cornerstone of deep learning, and
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating
this process. Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture
Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use,
inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT),
researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on
macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary
algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in
discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational
resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce
Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which
bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.
Experiments show that DASViT delivers architectures that break traditional
Transformer encoder designs, outperform ViT-B/16 on multiple datasets, and
achieve superior efficiency with fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model

AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability
technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation
gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation
analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious
relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and
tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical
image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension
agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss
function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any
problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically
decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually
enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the
original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art
demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable

comprehensive understanding of the impact, potential, and limitations of LLMs
in AIOps remains in its infancy. To address this gap, we conducted a detailed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Likert量表忽略了项目成功的多面性和情境依赖性，需要更动态的评估方法。

Method: 采用分层Type-1 Mamdani模糊系统，优先考虑用户持续积极影响，减少对次要结果的关注。

Result: 该方法可能更准确地衡量项目成功，并适用于复杂评估。

Conclusion: 未来研究将聚焦于模糊逻辑在社会科学中的实证测试和广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to project success evaluation by
integrating fuzzy logic into an existing construct. Traditional Likert-scale
measures often overlook the context-dependent and multifaceted nature of
project success. The proposed hierarchical Type-1 Mamdani fuzzy system
prioritizes sustained positive impact for end-users, reducing emphasis on
secondary outcomes like stakeholder satisfaction and internal project success.
This dynamic approach may provide a more accurate measure of project success
and could be adaptable to complex evaluations. Future research will focus on
empirical testing and broader applications of fuzzy logic in social science.

*Zhichao Sheng,Shilin Zhou,Chen Gong,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: UniSLU是一个统一框架，用于联合建模多个SLU任务，通过统一表示和生成方法提升任务交互和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖独立模型架构，增加了系统复杂性，限制了任务间交互，未能充分利用异构数据集。

Method: 提出统一表示和生成方法，联合建模ASR、spoken NER和SA任务，并与大语言模型集成。

Result: 在公开SLU数据集上表现优异，性能超越基准方法。

Conclusion: UniSLU适合实际语音多媒体场景，代码和模型将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric
multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in
scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU
encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA).
However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for
individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity,
limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous
datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a
single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for
diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across
multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative
method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task
interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to
harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public
SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior
SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited
for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and
models at github to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的两阶段神经网络方法，用于模拟任意发型、体型和动作的头发动态效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决头发动态模拟在广泛场景下的通用性问题，包括发型、体型和动作的多样性。

Method: 使用Transformer架构的静态网络预测静态头发形状，解决头发与身体的穿透问题；动态网络通过跨注意力机制融合静态特征与运动输入，生成动态效果。

Result: 实现了高保真、通用的头发动态模拟，支持实时推理，并能处理复杂发型和突然动作。

Conclusion: 该方法在广泛场景下表现出优异的通用性和高保真效果，适用于复杂发型和动态动作。

Abstract: Simulating hair dynamics that generalize across arbitrary hairstyles, body
shapes, and motions is a critical challenge. Our novel two-stage neural
solution is the first to leverage Transformer-based architectures for such a
broad generalization. We propose a Transformer-powered static network that
predicts static draped shapes for any hairstyle, effectively resolving
hair-body penetrations and preserving hair fidelity. Subsequently, a dynamic
network with a novel cross-attention mechanism fuses static hair features with
kinematic input to generate expressive dynamics and complex secondary motions.
This dynamic network also allows for efficient fine-tuning of challenging
motion sequences, such as abrupt head movements. Our method offers real-time
inference for both static single-frame drapes and dynamic drapes over pose
sequences. Our method demonstrates high-fidelity and generalizable dynamic hair
across various styles, guided by physics-informed losses, and can resolve
penetrations even for complex, unseen long hairstyles, highlighting its broad
generalization.

TL;DR: VLN-PE平台填补了视觉与语言导航（VLN）在物理机器人部署中的空白，支持多种机器人类型，并揭示了当前模型在物理环境中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法在物理机器人部署中的理想化假设与实际挑战不符，需要更真实的评估平台。

Method: 引入VLN-PE平台，支持人形、四足和轮式机器人，评估了多种VLN方法在物理环境中的表现。

Result: 发现性能下降问题，如机器人观测空间受限、环境光照变化和物理碰撞等，并揭示了四足机器人在复杂环境中的运动限制。

Conclusion: VLN-PE为改进跨具身适应性提供了新途径，并希望激发社区对VLN局限性的重新思考。

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but
their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect
physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and
wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several
ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical
pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action
prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,
map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results
reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation
space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like
collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged
robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless
integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN
evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical
deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's
overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to
rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is
available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于物理的LiDAR新视角合成方法，通过显式建模传感器特性（如滚动快门、激光功率变化和强度衰减）来实现更准确的LiDAR仿真，并展示了高分辨率LiDAR扫描重新仿真的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的新视角合成方法在LiDAR仿真和大规模3D场景重建中得到应用，但针对LiDAR特定效果的建模仍然不足。虽然已有加速渲染或处理动态场景的解决方案，但LiDAR传感器的特殊特性（如滚动快门、激光功率变化、强度衰减等）仍未得到充分处理，影响了仿真的准确性。

Method: 通过显式建模LiDAR传感器的特殊特性来改进新视角合成方法，包括：1）建模滚动快门效应；2）考虑激光功率变化；3）建模强度衰减；4）集成这些传感器特性到现有的新视角合成框架中，实现基于物理的LiDAR仿真。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在定量和定性评估中都表现出更准确的LiDAR仿真效果。消融实验证明了每个传感器建模组件的重要性。此外，该方法还展现了先进的重新仿真能力，能够在相机视角下生成高分辨率的LiDAR扫描数据。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模LiDAR传感器的物理特性，该方法显著提升了LiDAR仿真的准确性，为LiDAR仿真和大规模3D场景重建提供了更可靠的解决方案。该方法不仅在准确性上超越了现有技术，还具备了从不同视角生成高质量LiDAR数据的高级功能。

Abstract: Methods for Novel View Synthesis (NVS) have recently found traction in the
field of LiDAR simulation and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. While
solutions for faster rendering or handling dynamic scenes have been proposed,
LiDAR specific effects remain insufficiently addressed. By explicitly modeling
sensor characteristics such as rolling shutter, laser power variations, and
intensity falloff, our method achieves more accurate LiDAR simulation compared
to existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods,
as well as ablation studies that highlight the importance of each sensor model
component. Beyond that, we show that our approach exhibits advanced
resimulation capabilities, such as generating high resolution LiDAR scans in
the camera perspective.
  Our code and the resulting dataset are available at

Abstract: Traffic Movement Count (TMC) at intersections is crucial for optimizing
signal timings, assessing the performance of existing traffic control measures,
and proposing efficient lane configurations to minimize delays, reduce
congestion, and promote safety. Traditionally, methods such as manual counting,
loop detectors, pneumatic road tubes, and camera-based recognition have been
used for TMC estimation. Although generally reliable, camera-based TMC
estimation is prone to inaccuracies under poor lighting conditions during harsh
weather and nighttime. In contrast, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
technology is gaining popularity in recent times due to reduced costs and its
expanding use in 3D object detection, tracking, and related applications. This
paper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a
dual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC
estimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to
classify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and
vehicle classes. This work discusses the estimated TMC results and provides
insights into the observed trends and irregularities. Potential improvements
are also discussed that could enhance not only TMC estimation, but also
trajectory forecasting and intent prediction at intersections.

Abstract: This paper explores the computational complexity of diffusion-based language
modeling. We prove a dichotomy based on the quality of the score-matching
network in a diffusion model. In one direction, a network that exactly computes
the score function of some initial distribution can only perform language
modeling within the $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class, reflecting limitations
tied to rapid convergence. In the other direction, we show that if there is no
requirement for the network to match any score function, then diffusion
modeling can simulate any Turing machine in a certain sense. This dichotomy
provides a theoretical lens on the capabilities and limitations of diffusion
models, particularly concerning tasks requiring sequential computation. We
conjecture extensions of our theoretical results, including for the case where
the diffusion model is not perfect, but merely good. We also discuss the wider
context and practical implications, and hypothesize that a machine learning
architecture that can interpolate between sequential and parallel modes of
operation would be superior to both Transformers and diffusion models.

Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which
generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here,
we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the
$\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the
choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an
underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped
with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant
semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a
characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank
tensor completion problems.
