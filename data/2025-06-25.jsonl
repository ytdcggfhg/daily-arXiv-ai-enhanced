This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

These systems\ntranscend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating\nautonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a\ndynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to\ninteractive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also\nintroduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational\ndepth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of\nopen-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the\ndominant paradigm for future information seeking.

In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage\nfine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities\nby utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).\nFurthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our\nRFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional\nillusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate\nthat Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in\nthe Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its\nreasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and\ndataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1."}

In this quantitative study, we benchmark over\n20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive\nexperiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and\nsynthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments\ninvestigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training\nepoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a\ndetailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a\ncomprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for\ndigital pathology images."}

Semi-automatic methods reported\n80.00--92.10\\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\\% for adenoma segmentation.\nConclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field\nstrength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as\nU-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but\nfurther improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in\nsmall structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and\nlarger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical\napplicability."}

While\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its\noutcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the\nthinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address\nthe high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced\nRL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by\nintegrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL\ntraining process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on\nthree hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets\ndemonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking\nmodels while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

However, they remain constrained by a single-frame\nobservation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information\noffered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large\nvision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and\ninference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends\nsingle-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient\npost-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens\nprediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)\nmulti-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from\ndiscrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating\nmotion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame\ndecoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared\ndecoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and\ncaching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an\napplication of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation\nmechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during\nfinetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with\n70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO. Real-world\nFranka experiments also show the strong performance and robustness."}

We identify the core computational\nbottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly\nmatrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we\npropose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector\nmultiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational\ncost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an\nefficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in\nCayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow\nOFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage\nwithout compromising performance.
