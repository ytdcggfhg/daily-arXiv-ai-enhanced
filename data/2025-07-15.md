### [1] [Spatial ModernBERT: Spatial-Aware Transformer for Table and Key-Value Extraction in Financial Documents at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08865)
*Javis AI Team,Amrendra Singh,Maulik Shah,Dharshan Sampath*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的Spatial ModernBERT模型，用于从复杂财务文档中提取表格和键值对，通过空间嵌入和多任务分类头实现高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 财务文档中的表格和键值对提取对审计、数据分析和自动化发票处理等业务流程至关重要。

Method: 模型采用三个分类头（标签、列、行）进行标记分类，预训练后微调，并结合后处理方法重构表格布局。

Result: 实验表明，模型能有效利用文本和空间信息，在真实财务文档中实现高精度提取。

Conclusion: Spatial ModernBERT为财务文档的自动化处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

### [2] [SEALGuard: Safeguarding the Multilingual Conversations in Southeast Asian Languages for LLM Software Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08898)
*Wenliang Shan,Michael Fu,Rui Yang,Chakkrit,Tantithamthavorn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一种多语言护栏，旨在提升LLM系统在多语言环境中的安全对齐能力，显著优于现有方法如LlamaGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入（尤其是低资源语言）上表现不佳，导致LLM系统存在安全隐患。

Method: 通过低秩适应（LoRA）将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建了包含26万条多语言提示的SEALSBench数据集。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言不安全提示检测上表现优异，防御成功率（DSR）比LlamaGuard提升48%，且在所有指标上领先。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效的多语言护栏设计，显著提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

### [3] [Evaluating LLMs in Medicine: A Call for Rigor, Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08916)
*Mahmoud Alwakeel,Aditya Nagori,Vijay Krishnamoorthy,Rishikesan Kamaleswaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了当前大型语言模型（LLM）在医学问答中的局限性，重点关注评估数据集的质量，提出需要标准化框架和合作改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在医学问答中的表现，发现现有数据集的不足，推动更严谨的评估方法。

Method: 回顾了MedQA等常用基准数据集，分析了其严谨性、透明性和临床相关性，并探讨了医学期刊挑战题的潜力。

Result: 现有数据集缺乏临床真实性、透明性和验证过程，挑战题虽有益但规模小、范围窄且可能被LLM训练过。

Conclusion: 需建立标准化评估框架，通过多方合作确保数据集和方法严谨、无偏且反映临床复杂性。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了两个韩国专家级基准测试KMMLU-Redux和KMMLU-Pro，用于评估大型语言模型在韩国工业领域的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够全面评估大型语言模型在学术和工业领域适用性的基准测试。

Result: 实验证明这些基准测试能全面代表韩国工业知识。

Conclusion: 公开数据集，为评估模型在韩国工业领域的适用性提供可靠工具。

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires robust benchmarks
that encompass not only academic domains but also industrial fields to
effectively evaluate their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce two Korean expert-level benchmarks. KMMLU-Redux,
reconstructed from the existing KMMLU, consists of questions from the Korean
National Technical Qualification exams, with critical errors removed to enhance
reliability. KMMLU-Pro is based on Korean National Professional Licensure exams
to reflect professional knowledge in Korea. Our experiments demonstrate that
these benchmarks comprehensively represent industrial knowledge in Korea. We
release our dataset publicly available.

### [5] [Self-Improving Model Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08967)
*Rongyi Zhu,Yuhui Wang,Tanqiu Jiang,Jiacheng Liang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIMS是一种无需外部监督的自改进模型引导框架，通过自主生成和优化对比样本，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）的引导效果和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型引导方法依赖外部标注数据，限制了其适应性和效果。SIMS旨在通过自改进机制解决这一问题。

Method: SIMS通过迭代自改进循环生成和优化对比样本，并采用提示排名和对比采样等新策略增强引导效果。

Result: 在多种LLM和基准测试中，SIMS显著优于现有方法，展现了更高的引导效果和适应性。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理时对齐研究的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

### [6] [Application of CARE-SD text classifier tools to assess distribution of stigmatizing and doubt-marking language features in EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08969)
*Drew Walker,Jennifer Love,Swati Rajwal,Isabel C Walker,Hannah LF Cooper,Abeed Sarker,Melvin Livingston III*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现电子健康记录（EHR）中存在对特定患者群体的污名化语言，尤其是黑人、低收入患者及某些疾病患者，且不同医疗提供者表现出类似模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨电子健康记录中污名化语言的普遍性及其对不同患者群体的影响。

Method: 通过扩展词典匹配和监督学习分类器识别MIMIC-III EHR中的怀疑标记和污名化标签，并使用泊松回归模型分析预测因素。

Result: 黑人、低收入患者及某些疾病患者的污名化标签率更高，护士和社会工作者的污名化语言使用率也较高。

Conclusion: 污名化语言在历史污名化患者中更常见，且由多种医疗提供者传播，需采取措施减少此类现象。

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated
by multiple provider types.

### [7] [Beyond vividness: Content analysis of induced hallucinations reveals the hidden structure of individual differences in visual imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09011)
*Ana Chkhaidze,Reshanne R. Reeder,Connor Gag,Anastasia Kiyonaga,Seana Coulson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容与个体的视觉想象力强度相关，强想象力者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象力者报告简单几何模式。视觉语言模型能更好捕捉这些差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉想象力差异如何影响Ganzflicker诱导的幻觉内容，验证想象力谱系假说。

Method: 分析4,000多名参与者的自由文本描述，使用自然语言处理和视觉语言模型工具。

Result: 强想象力者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象力者报告简单几何模式；视觉语言模型优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 结果支持想象力谱系假说，反映早期视觉区与高阶区域协调的个体差异。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

### [8] [Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09025)
*Chien Van Nguyen,Ruiyi Zhang,Hanieh Deilamsalehy,Puneet Mathur,Viet Dac Lai,Haoliang Wang,Jayakumar Subramanian,Ryan A. Rossi,Trung Bui,Nikos Vlassis,Franck Dernoncourt,Thien Huu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lizard是一种线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer大语言模型转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了内存和计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在上下文长度增加时面临内存和计算瓶颈，Lizard旨在通过次二次注意力机制解决这些问题。

Method: Lizard引入次二次注意力机制，结合门控模块和滑动窗口注意力，形成混合机制，同时提出硬件感知算法加速训练。

Result: Lizard在标准语言建模任务中几乎无损恢复教师模型性能，在5-shot MMLU基准测试中比先前模型提升18分。

Conclusion: Lizard通过灵活的架构设计和高效的注意力机制，显著提升了长上下文生成任务的性能。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALIGN系统通过基于提示的对齐方法，动态个性化LLM决策者，支持多属性分析和模块化算法集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户多样化的价值观和偏好影响决策，需要新的LLM对齐和个性化方法。

Method: 提出ALIGN系统，通过提示对齐细粒度属性，支持配置管理、结构化输出生成和可交换LLM算法。

Result: 系统支持定性和定量分析，在公共意见调查和医疗分诊决策中验证对齐方法。

Conclusion: ALIGN框架开源，推动可靠、负责任和个性化的LLM决策研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

*Wasi Uddin Ahmad,Somshubra Majumdar,Aleksander Ficek,Sean Narenthiran,Mehrzad Samadi,Jocelyn Huang,Siddhartha Jain,Vahid Noroozi,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OpenCodeReasoning-II数据集，包含2.5M个问题-解决方案-评价三元组，并采用两阶段监督微调策略，提升了代码生成和评价的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于推理的大语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成和评价方面潜力巨大，但进展依赖于大规模高质量数据集。

Method: 采用两阶段监督微调策略：第一阶段专注于代码生成，第二阶段联合训练代码生成和评价模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型在代码生成性能上达到或超过最佳公开权重模型，且结合代码生成与评价模型显著提升了竞争性编程性能。

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II数据集和两阶段微调策略为代码生成与评价提供了有效工具，并扩展了LiveCodeBench基准以支持C++语言。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

### [11] [Dynamic Parameter Memory: Temporary LoRA-Enhanced LLM for Long-Sequence Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09076)
*Jialong Mai,Xiaofen Xing,Yawei Li,Zhipeng Li,Jingyuan Xing,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，用于解决语音大语言模型（SLLM）在长音频序列情感识别中的上下文限制问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理能力，现有方法忽略了情感在对话中的连续性。

Method: 提出DPM机制，通过临时LoRA模块动态编码句子级信息和情感，支持无限长度音频处理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM的情感识别能力，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效解决了SLLM在长音频情感识别中的上下文限制问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: CompassJudger-2是一种新型通用评判模型，通过任务驱动的多领域数据策略提升评判能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评判模型存在专业狭窄和鲁棒性不足的问题，限制了其全面评估能力。

Method: 采用任务驱动的多领域数据策略，结合可验证奖励和监督任务，通过拒绝采样和边际策略梯度损失提升性能。

Result: CompassJudger-2在多个评判和奖励基准测试中表现优异，7B模型与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了鲁棒、可扩展的LLM评判，并建立了新的性能和评估标准。

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPENXRD是一个用于晶体学问答的开卷系统，结合GPT-4.5生成的简明支持内容，显著提升了小模型在X射线衍射（XRD）任务中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统扫描教材可能带来的版权问题，同时填补小模型在晶体学领域的知识空白。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考内容，并在217个专家级XRD问题上评估不同视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成摘要的模型在准确性上显著提升，尤其是在晶体学知识有限的模型中。

Conclusion: OPENXRD展示了开卷系统在材料科学中的实用性，并为科学领域的自然语言处理工具提供了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模型PU-Lie，结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释特征和PU学习目标，用于检测战略对话中的欺骗行为，在Diplomacy数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略对话中欺骗检测的复杂性和类别不平衡问题，尤其是欺骗性信息占比极低（<5%）。

Method: 结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释的语言和游戏特定特征，采用PU学习目标，专注于欺骗类别的建模。

Result: 模型在Diplomacy数据集上取得了0.60的宏F1分数，同时减少了650倍以上的可训练参数。

Conclusion: PU学习、语言可解释性和说话者感知表示在欺骗检测中具有重要价值，准确检测欺骗比识别真实信息更为关键。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

*Ameen Ali,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于剪枝的微调方法，通过识别并移除与数据集特定机制相关的神经元，提升大语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常依赖数据集特定的机制，导致在新任务或分布上性能下降，因此需要一种方法增强其泛化能力。

Method: 使用Integrated Gradients量化神经元对高置信度预测的影响，识别并剪枝与数据集特定机制相关的神经元。

Result: 在多选题基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，优于之前的非剪枝适应方法。

Conclusion: 通过剪枝数据集特定神经元，模型能更依赖可泛化的表示，从而提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决藏语作为低资源语言在现有大语言模型中的不足，缺乏高质量训练数据的问题。

Method: 收集多样化数据源，构建藏语专用清洗和处理流程，预训练多语言基础模型为Banzhida。

Result: Banzhida在多项任务中显著优于同类开源模型和藏语专用模型。

Conclusion: Banzhida模型填补了藏语生成AI的空白，为低资源语言提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: 研究分析了视觉隐喻（如融化的冰川表现为融化的冰手榴弹）在气候变化传播中的效果，发现其虽认知负荷较高，但能引发更深层次的认知加工和更积极的体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中的实际效果，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 创建MetaClimage数据库，包含视觉隐喻和字面图像，并通过人类评分和自然语言处理分析其效果。

Result: 视觉隐喻被认为更难理解但更美观，未在效果和情感唤起上优于字面图像，但能引发更多标签和更积极的情绪。

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中具有认知和美学优势，但需权衡其复杂性。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在幽默翻译中存在语言干扰和缺乏幽默感的问题，需要改进。

Method: 采用心理学启发的HDM机制，结合CoT模仿人类思维过程，并融入幽默理论优化翻译。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在幽默性、流畅性和连贯性上分别提升了7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM机制有效提升了幽默翻译的质量，为跨文化沟通提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

Conclusion: ClaritySpeech在提升语音质量和隐私保护方面表现优异，适用于低数据环境。

Abstract: Dementia, a neurodegenerative disease, alters speech patterns, creating
communication barriers and raising privacy concerns. Current speech
technologies, such as automatic speech transcription (ASR), struggle with
dementia and atypical speech, further challenging accessibility. This paper
presents a novel dementia obfuscation in speech framework, ClaritySpeech,
integrating ASR, text obfuscation, and zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) to
correct dementia-affected speech while preserving speaker identity in low-data
environments without fine-tuning. Results show a 16% and 10% drop in mean F1
score across various adversarial settings and modalities (audio, text, fusion)
for ADReSS and ADReSSo, respectively, maintaining 50% speaker similarity. We
also find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15
for ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and

Motivation: 数据归因方法在LLM研究和应用中日益重要，但缺乏系统化的评估标准。

Method: 引入DATE-LM基准，通过训练数据选择、毒性/偏见过滤和事实归因三个任务评估归因方法。

Result: 发现现有方法在不同任务中表现不一，没有单一方法在所有任务中占优，且方法性能受任务设计影响。

Conclusion: DATE-LM为未来LLM数据归因研究提供了基础，并发布了公共排行榜以促进社区参与。

Abstract: Data attribution methods quantify the influence of training data on model
outputs and are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of LLM research
and applications, including dataset curation, model interpretability, data
valuation. However, there remain critical gaps in systematic LLM-centric
evaluation of data attribution methods. To this end, we introduce DATE-LM (Data
Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

Conclusion: 优化模型在医疗领域表现优异，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter

modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Conclusion: ViSP能生成更高质量的讽刺内容，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Our dataset and code will be released at

Conclusion: 通过LLM生成的高质量合成数据和强化学习优化的数据增强策略，有效解决了ABSA中的训练数据不足和不平衡问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单用途AI系统在协调性、记忆复用和任务分解方面不足，难以满足现代企业环境的复杂需求。

Method: GoalfyMax基于模型上下文协议（MCP）构建A2A通信层，采用经验包（XP）架构实现分层记忆，并整合多轮对话、长短期记忆模块和动态安全验证。

Result: 实验证明GoalfyMax在复杂任务编排中优于基线框架，展现出更高的适应性和协调性。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来解决方案。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文引用任务（LCLMs将兴趣项归因于长上下文数据的特定部分）尚未充分探索，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计Ref-Long基准，要求LCLMs识别引用特定键的文档索引，强调上下文关系而非简单检索。构建了从合成到现实的三个子集。

Conclusion: Ref-Long揭示了LCLMs在长上下文引用中的局限性，为未来研究提供了关键见解和数据支持。

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Method: 系统评估了人为合理和合成的提示错误对LLM性能的影响，包括定量分析和定性观察。

Result: 提示质量显著影响翻译性能，不同噪声类型对性能的影响程度不同；LLM在极端噪声下仍能翻译。

Conclusion: 提示质量对LLM的指令遵循能力影响较大，但对翻译质量本身影响较小；LLM在噪声环境下仍具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用现有模型为未支持语言（如白俄罗斯语）生成定义，提出了一个包含43,150条定义的新数据集，并发现适应定义建模系统所需数据量较少，但自动指标存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定义建模任务在辅助词典编纂工作中具有潜力，但现有模型对未支持语言的适应性尚待评估。

Method: 提出一个白俄罗斯语的新数据集，并测试现有模型在该语言上的适应性。

Result: 实验表明，适应定义建模系统所需数据量较少，但自动指标未能完全捕捉模型表现。

Conclusion: 研究为未支持语言的模型适应提供了初步探索，但自动评估指标仍需改进。

Abstract: Definition modeling, the task of generating new definitions for words in
context, holds great prospect as a means to assist the work of lexicographers
in documenting a broader variety of lects and languages, yet much remains to be
done in order to assess how we can leverage pre-existing models for as-of-yet
unsupported languages. In this work, we focus on adapting existing models to
Belarusian, for which we propose a novel dataset of 43,150 definitions. Our
experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

*Hanwool Lee,Sara Yu,Yewon Hwang,Jonghyun Choi,Heejae Ahn,Sungbum Jung,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NMIXX是一种针对金融领域的跨语言嵌入模型，通过微调高置信度三元组提升金融语义捕捉能力，并在低资源语言（如韩语）中表现优异。同时发布的KorFinSTS基准测试揭示了通用基准测试忽略的金融语义细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型在金融领域和低资源语言（如韩语）中表现不佳，主要由于领域术语、时间语义变化和双语词汇不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出NMIXX模型，通过微调18.8K高置信度三元组（包含领域内同义句、语义偏移的负样本和精确韩英翻译）来优化金融语义捕捉能力。

Result: NMIXX在英语FinSTS和韩语KorFinSTS基准测试中分别提升Spearman's rho 0.10和0.22，优于其他模型，但通用STS性能略有下降。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS为金融领域的跨语言表示学习提供了有效工具，同时强调了分词设计在低资源语言中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpreadPy是一个Python库，用于模拟认知单层和多层网络中的激活传播，支持结构-功能关系研究，并通过案例展示其应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发SpreadPy旨在通过模拟激活传播，研究认知、心理和临床现象中的结构-功能关系，为知识建模提供系统工具。

Method: SpreadPy通过数值模拟，结合实证或理论网络，分析激活动态，并通过三个案例研究验证其效用。

Result: 案例研究显示，SpreadPy能区分数学焦虑学生的知识结构差异、揭示认知负荷对词汇访问的影响，以及关联失语症患者的网络结构与错误类型。

Conclusion: SpreadPy为心理学、神经科学和教育研究提供了可重复的机制性研究工具，支持个体差异和认知障碍的建模。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

Result: 参数化方法在跨语言泛化上表现不佳，指令调优方法更稳健；多语言联合训练提升了编辑和迁移能力。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语KE研究填补了空白，多语言训练提升了性能，为未来研究提供了数据和基准。

Abstract: While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its
behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined.
In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods
(ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact
benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our
experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle
with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more
robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show
that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We
release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泰国法律问答系统中RAG的性能有限，尤其是在需要复杂法律推理的问题上。

Method: 采用Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，利用BGE-M3嵌入作为成本效益高的语义相似性奖励。

Result: 在NitiBench基准测试中，GRPO比基础模型提升了90%的引用F1分数，并在联合质量指标上比指令调优提高了31%。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂法律推理任务上表现出更强的鲁棒性，为提升泰国法律LLM提供了一种高效且资源节约的解决方案。

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large
language model judges. Experiments on the NitiBench benchmark demonstrate
substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and
resource-efficient solution for enhancing Thai legal LLMs.

TL;DR: MCEval是一个多语言文化评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型的文化偏见和跨文化理解能力，涵盖13种文化和语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和跨文化理解能力不足的问题，尤其在全球多样化用户群体中表现明显。

Method: 采用动态文化问题构建和反事实重述、混杂重述的因果分析方法。

Result: 评估结果显示性能差异与训练数据分布和语言文化对齐相关，并揭示了公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）的潜在空间几何结构中，高级语义信息集中在低维子空间，且在不同领域形成线性可分的表示。这种可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下更明显，支持开发基于几何的工具用于检测和防御有害内容。


<details>

Motivation: 探索LLM内部表示是否以可解释的方式组织语义信息，以改进模型对齐和行为解释。

Method: 对11个基于Transformer的LLM进行大规模实证研究，分析6个科学主题和12层的隐藏状态。

Result: 高级语义信息集中在低维子空间，可分性在深层和结构化推理提示下增强，支持简单因果干预（如链式推理）。

Conclusion: 潜在空间几何结构为开发轻量级防御工具（如MLP分类器）提供了基础，能高效检测恶意提示。

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练语言模型的自适应课程学习范式，通过模型自身预测的难度分数优化训练顺序，提升了自然语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标（如文本长度），可能无法准确反映模型视角，需更自适应的策略。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型预测样本难度分数，探索不同训练策略（从易到难、从难到易、混合采样）进行微调。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上验证，相比随机采样，该方法收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: 自适应课程学习能有效提升模型训练效率和性能，为自然语言处理任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点击诱饵定义缺乏共识，需明确其与类似现象的区别。

Method: 提出新定义，优化数据集创建方法，减少主观性，并发布TA1C数据集。

Result: TA1C数据集包含3,500条推文，标注一致性达0.825，基线模型F1分数为0.84。

Conclusion: 新定义和数据集为点击诱饵检测提供了更客观的标准和工具。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在未见任务中任务级泛化的内部机制，尤其是通过‘加一’任务（如1+1=3）这一反事实任务。

Method: 使用电路风格解释技术（如路径修补）分析模型内部计算，揭示泛化机制。

Result: 发现了一种函数归纳机制，类似于先前工作中的归纳头机制，并展示了该机制在更广泛任务中的复用性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中可复用和可组合的结构如何支持任务级泛化，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义信息，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 结合分层文本分割和聚类，生成更语义连贯的文本块，并利用段和簇级别的向量表示进行检索。

Result: 在NarrativeQA、QuALITY和QASPER数据集上表现优于传统分块方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RAG系统的检索效果，为外部知识增强的LLMs提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Motivation: 随着奖励模型在测试时策略中的广泛应用，其推理成本成为关注焦点。研究旨在探索小型高效模型的潜力。

Method: 结合FLAN风格提示、定向低秩适应（DoRA）和层冻结技术，在RewardBench上实现高性能。

Result: TinyRM在推理任务中表现优异，轻量级微调方法尤其有效。

Conclusion: 小型双向架构有望成为高效、可扩展的偏好建模替代方案，尽管在通用模型和对话偏好建模上仍有挑战。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

Result: 实验证明TextOmics有效，ToDi优于现有方法，并在零样本治疗分子生成中表现出潜力。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了新工具，展示了异构数据整合和可控生成的潜力。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

Result: 模型在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为自杀风险预测提供了更准确和可解释的工具，有助于临床干预。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的计算需求高，部署和使用存在障碍，模型压缩是解决这一问题的关键。

Method: GeLaCo采用基于种群的搜索和模块相似性适应度函数，支持单目标和多目标进化压缩搜索。

Result: GeLaCo在困惑度和生成评估中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能真正代表人类多元文化价值观，而非简单平均化。

Method: 通过应用道德基础问卷，在19种文化背景下比较LLMs与人类基线数据。

Result: LLMs系统性地同质化道德多样性，模型规模增加未显著提升文化代表性。

Conclusion: 当前AI对齐方法存在根本性局限，需更接地气的对齐目标和评估指标，以确保AI系统代表多元人类价值观。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Qinyu Liu,Jun Zhang,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LLMs和普通Transformer的新架构，用于时间序列预测，融合了语义和时间信息，提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法在时间序列预测中表现不佳，因其擅长处理离散文本而非连续数值数据；普通Transformer则难以捕捉高级语义模式。

Method: 设计了一种新型Transformer架构，融合LLMs的语义表示和普通Transformer的时间信息，生成混合表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLMs和Transformer的优势，新架构显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

*Khouloud Saadi,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于任务的特征蒸馏方法，无需额外参数即可在不同隐藏层大小的师生模型间进行知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统特征蒸馏方法因师生模型隐藏层大小相同限制学生架构灵活性的问题，避免线性投影器引入额外参数和性能下降。

Method: 通过识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活蒸馏到学生模型。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务上表现优于基线方法，性能提升达3%。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，可与其他蒸馏框架结合，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用大语言模型（LLMs）将包含仇恨言论和脏话的文本转换为非攻击性文本，同时保留原意，并评估了Gemini、GPT-4o、DeepSeek和Groq等模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在识别和转换攻击性文本方面的有效性，以生成语义和情感一致的非攻击性文本。

Method: 使用LLMs识别攻击性文本并转换为非攻击性版本，随后通过情感分析和语义分析评估原始及转换后的数据集。

Result: Groq与其他模型表现差异显著，GPT-4o与DeepSeek-V3表现相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在攻击性文本转换中具有潜力，但不同模型表现差异明显。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Method: 设计了包含18,000多个多选题的Absher基准，涵盖六类任务，评估多种先进大语言模型。

Result: 模型在文化和语境相关任务中表现不佳，显示出方言感知训练的必要性。

Conclusion: 需开发方言感知训练和文化对齐的评估方法，以提升大语言模型在阿拉伯应用中的实际表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于进化搜索的自动离散提示优化方法，用于解决复杂任务和小型LLMs中的提示设计挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示工程方法多针对简单任务和大型LLMs，而复杂任务和小型LLMs对提示设计更敏感，需要更优的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段进化搜索：第一阶段使用语法引导的遗传编程合成提示创建程序，第二阶段通过局部搜索优化性能。

Result: 在三个小型通用LLMs和四个领域特定任务中，该方法优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt等基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂任务和小型LLMs中表现优异，性能退化极少，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP领域取得进展，模型仍易受对抗攻击（如同义词替换）影响，而循环网络和现代状态空间模型（如S4）的鲁棒性研究较少。

Method: 通过计算GBM，针对LSTM、S4和CNN三种架构，减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗鲁棒性上比现有基线提升高达8.8%，优于多种先进防御方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法有效提升了NLP模型的鲁棒性，尤其在S4模型上表现突出。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在语言学研究中作为可靠分析工具的潜力，特别是在涉及运动动词的时间表达中情感意义的涌现。通过四项心理语言学实验，研究发现人类与AI反应高度一致，表明LLM可以补充传统人类实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证LLM（如GPT-4）是否能复现人类在语言学任务中的细微判断，以评估其作为研究工具的可靠性。

Method: 方法包括四项心理语言学实验，分别研究涌现意义、情感变化、情绪语境中的动词选择及句子-表情符号关联，先以人类参与者进行，再用LLM复现。

Result: 结果显示人类与AI反应高度一致（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），仅在少数情况下有微小差异，但不影响整体解释。

Conclusion: 结论支持LLM作为语言学研究中可信赖的协作工具，能够扩展研究规模且不损害解释有效性。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

TL;DR: 提出一个分层隐喻处理模型，将意义分为内容分析、概念融合和语用意三个层次，为计算系统提供更丰富的隐喻解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻意义不是简单的概念映射，而是复杂的认知现象，需要多层次解释。

Method: 提出三层框架：内容分析、概念融合和语用意，逐步处理隐喻。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更深入、更语境敏感的隐喻理解方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为计算隐喻理解提供了更全面的理论基础，支持更深层次的推理。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Result: 发现Transformer能有效提取子结构，并展示其在处理复杂图类型（如分子图）中的能力。

Conclusion: 序列化Transformer能有效执行图数据的子结构提取任务，为理解其机制提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在异步任务导向对话中提出澄清问题的能力，以及其与人类行为的差异。

Method: 结合Minecraft Dialogue Corpus的两种注释，构建新语料库，比较LLMs与人类在模糊性情境下的澄清问题生成。

Result: 人类很少因指代模糊提问，而LLMs更常为此提问；推理能力可能提升LLMs提问的频率和相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs的澄清问题能力与推理能力相关，但与人类行为差异显著。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

Motivation: 传统招聘流程在简历筛选和候选人匹配中存在时间和资源瓶颈，MLAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MLAR利用LLM分三层处理：提取职位关键特征、解析简历信息、语义匹配候选人，并集成到RPA流程中。

Result: MLAR在2400份简历处理中，平均每份耗时5.4秒，比主流RPA平台效率提升约17%。

Conclusion: MLAR为现代招聘需求提供了高效、准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，如何可靠检测AI生成文本成为问题，尤其是扩散模型的效果尚不明确。

Method: 使用2000个样本，比较LLaDA和LLaMA在困惑度、突发性、词汇多样性、可读性及BLEU/ROUGE分数上的表现。

Result: 扩散文本（LLaDA）在困惑度和突发性上更接近人类文本，导致基于自回归的检测器高漏检率；自回归文本（LLaMA）困惑度低但词汇保真度差。

Conclusion: 单一指标无法区分扩散文本与人类写作，需开发扩散感知检测器，如混合模型、扩散特定特征或鲁棒水印。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注参数共享或自适应计算，未能同时实现两者，MoR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MoR通过共享层堆栈和轻量级路由器实现参数效率和自适应计算，动态分配递归深度，并选择性缓存键值对。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数的模型规模中，MoR在相同训练FLOPs下显著降低验证困惑度，提升少样本准确率，并提高吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR是高效实现大模型质量的有效路径，无需承担大模型的高成本。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Conclusion: LLM作为裁判在代码任务中表现不稳定，需优化提示策略以提高可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了REST框架，用于同时测试大型推理模型的多问题处理能力，揭示了现有单问题评估的局限性，并展示了模型在压力下的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单问题推理，无法反映真实世界的多上下文压力需求，且易受数据污染影响。

Method: 提出REST框架，通过同时暴露模型于多个问题，评估其上下文优先级分配、跨问题干扰抵抗和动态认知负载管理能力。

Result: 即使SOTA模型在压力测试下性能显著下降，REST显示出更强的区分能力，揭示了单问题评估中无法发现的性能差异。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、面向未来的评估范式，能更好地反映真实世界的推理需求，减少对人类标注的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了V2-VLNCE（多视角视觉语言导航）和VIL（视角不变学习）方法，通过对比学习和师生框架提升导航策略对视角变化的鲁棒性，并在多个数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有导航策略对视角变化敏感的问题，提升在连续环境中的视觉语言导航性能。

Method: 提出VIL方法，采用对比学习框架学习稀疏且视角不变的特征，并引入师生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE上性能提升8-15%，在标准VLNCE和RxR-CE数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: VIL是一种即插即用的后训练方法，能显著提升导航策略的鲁棒性且不影响标准视角性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it
relatively easy to create a video of anyone saying anything. Today, such
deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political

detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种无需数据和任务无关的方法，用于减少视觉语言模型中的隐含偏差，通过两阶段方法生成场景描述并学习投影以减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（如CLIP）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生预测偏差，PRISM旨在无需额外数据或预定义偏差类别的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）使用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）通过对比式去偏差损失学习投影，减少虚假相关性并保持图像与文本嵌入的对齐。

Result: 在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上，PRISM优于现有去偏差方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种有效且通用的去偏差解决方案，无需外部数据或预定义偏差类别。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

Method: 构建时空-运动学特征图像，使用通道重排矩阵优化特征排列，结合Vision Transformer和回归网络推断SMPL参数。

Result: 在3DPW和Human3.6M数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，显著提升了人体网格恢复的精度。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

Method: 生成合成实验数据，利用NeRF重建3D几何，MPM模拟初始化材料点位置，通过贝叶斯优化最小化图像损失估计摩擦角。

Result: 摩擦角估计误差在2度以内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性表征提供了可行的视觉解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

Motivation: 现有方法多关注数据量而非质量，且缺乏全面评估标签质量的工具，导致多模态模型在开放词汇任务中的性能受限。

Method: 提出VISTA框架，整合多阶段数据验证策略和人工专家知识，用于识别和修正FM生成标签中的问题。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和专家评审中，VISTA从定量和定性角度证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: VISTA通过提升数据质量，显著增强了多模态模型在开放词汇图像分割等任务中的表现。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成时出现模式崩溃和多样性降低，需要在不影响头部类别的情况下提升尾部类别的多样性。

Method: 引入两种对比损失函数：无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比条件与非条件生成增强尾部类别多样性。

Result: 方法在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，成功应用于类别不平衡扩散模型，提升了尾部类别的多样性。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度和注意力计算的二次复杂度，导致预填充时间延长。

Method: 通过分析VLM中的注意力模式，提出基于输入模板的注意力稀疏掩码（BlindSight），并利用数据集样本对每个注意力头进行稀疏分类。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上，BlindSight平均减少32%-41%的FLOPs，精度变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight有效优化了VLM推理，显著降低计算成本，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

Motivation: 光流提取是计算机视觉的核心问题，但现有方法需要微调且标签稀缺。本文探索是否可以通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型直接提取光流。

Method: 基于Counterfactual World Model范式，提出KL-tracing技术，通过注入扰动并跟踪传播来提取光流。特别适用于LRAS架构。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上，无需微调即优于现有方法（分别提升16.6%和4.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过提示可控生成视频模型是一种高效且可扩展的光流提取方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo通过整合放射科医生的眼动视频序列，提升了大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在胸部X光片（CXR）分析和疾病诊断中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动的顺序信息，而RadEyeVideo旨在通过捕捉眼动的时空动态来增强模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据作为视频序列输入到支持视频功能的LVLMs中，用于CXR报告生成和疾病诊断。

Result: 使用眼动视频后，模型性能在报告生成任务中提升24.6%，两项任务平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学LVLMs。

Conclusion: RadEyeVideo展示了专家知识（眼动信息）与LVLMs结合可显著提升通用模型在临床任务中的能力，为医学图像分析提供了一种可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

TL;DR: PointSD利用Stable Diffusion模型增强3D点云自监督学习，通过点云引导图像去噪并提取语义特征，提升3D表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型受限于小规模数据集，而文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）在大规模数据上训练，具备更强能力。

Method: 提出PointSD框架，将Stable Diffusion的文本编码器替换为3D编码器，训练点云到图像的扩散模型，并提取SD特征对齐3D特征。

Result: 实验表明，PointSD能有效提升点云自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion模型可显著增强3D点云的自监督学习能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），解决了传统方法在推理阶段的误差累积问题，同时提升了实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段无法避免误差累积，而扩散模型虽然能生成高质量结果，但迭代性质限制了实时性。本文旨在结合两者的优势，提升SLP的生成质量和效率。

Method: 采用混合自回归和扩散模型的方法，设计了多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制，以捕捉细节动作并动态引导生成过程。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成质量和实时流式效率上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了自回归和扩散模型的优势，显著提升了手语生成的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Result: 实验表明SAMPL优于现有方法，显著提升了模型在干扰条件下的性能。

Conclusion: RoHOI和SAMPL为HOI检测的鲁棒性研究提供了新标准，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙是持续学习中的关键因素，MG-CLIP方法简单有效。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法因数据集限制，只能生成短或通用文本提示的动作，缺乏精细控制和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SnapMoGen数据集（20K动作片段，44小时，122K详细文本描述）和改进的MoMask++模型，利用多尺度令牌序列和生成掩码变换器。

Result: MoMask++在HumanML3D和SnapMoGen基准测试中达到最优性能，并能处理用户输入。

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++显著提升了文本到动作生成的精细控制和泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的姿态估计框架，通过非线性MLP视觉语言连接器提升定位精度，优于现有方法LocLLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；LocLLM虽通过语言引导实现零样本泛化，但其线性投影器无法捕捉复杂空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM采用非线性MLP（两层+GELU激活）作为视觉语言连接器，增强视觉补丁与文本关键点描述的融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），同时在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的先进技术。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂3D场景标记化的挑战，以改进自动驾驶系统中的极端情况处理能力。

Method: 使用多尺度残差量化策略的intra-scene标记器和残差聚合时间依赖性的inter-scene标记器，结合编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在4D占用预测任务中，mIoU和IoU分别提升25.1%和36.9%，训练内存仅需2.9GB，推理速度达37.0FPS。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能与效率上均优于现有方法，为3D场景预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Delta Denoising Score在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度上存在问题，主要依赖复杂的辅助结构，导致优化信号冲突和局部编辑不精确。

Method: SSD通过固定一个分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)实现跨提示对齐，并引入空文本分支稳定优化过程。此外，增加了提示增强分支以提升编辑强度。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得了最先进的结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种高效、稳定的文本引导编辑解决方案，能够保持内容结构并实现平滑的提示特定修改。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive

accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to

Result: 实验表明，LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示池有效解决了FSCIL中的性能下降问题，为增量学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

Result: MCA-LLaVA在多种幻觉和通用基准测试中表现出色，有效缓解了图像对齐偏差。

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA通过改进位置建模，显著提升了多模态对齐效果，减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法。

Conclusion: THYME方法提升了动态场景图生成的准确性和一致性，适用于地面和空中场景。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D检测模型在开放道路中罕见异常物体检测能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出S3AD算法，解耦2D和3D训练策略，设计基于前景置信度的异常评分算法，并创建KITTI-AR数据集。

Result: 实验验证了算法和数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集提升了3D异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be
obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

Motivation: 当前缺乏百万级规模的全景图像数据集，现有二维预训练模型无法有效处理全景图像的失真和不连续性，影响任务性能。

Method: 采用基于预训练模型权重的球形离散采样方法，减少失真并获得良好初始训练值；将该方法应用于全景图像分割，利用球形模型特征作为特定通道注意力的掩码。

Result: 在常用室内数据集Stanford2D3D上取得了显著效果。

Conclusion: 球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像处理中的失真问题，提升了现有二维预训练模型在全景任务中的性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线长时点跟踪方法Track-On，基于Transformer架构，无需未来帧信息，在七个公开基准上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要在线预测，而现有方法多为离线，无法满足实时需求。视觉基础模型虽能提供几何表示，但缺乏时序推理能力。

Method: 引入Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点作为查询，逐帧处理视频，利用记忆机制传播外观和上下文信息。

Result: Track-On在七个公开基准上表现最优，证明了无需未来帧的长时跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可作为初始化，但需专用设计实现在线长时跟踪；Track-On展示了Transformer在此任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP）解决分布偏移和置信度不匹配问题，提升CLIP和SAM在视觉分类和医学分割任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在低样本迁移学习中表现优异，但部署时面临分布偏移和置信度不匹配两大挑战，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，包括FIP（减少嵌入空间协变量偏移）和CMP（校准分割任务的不确定性），并理论推导其泛化边界和优化目标。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集上提升3.5%准确率、降低28% ECE；医学分割任务中达到84.7% DSC和4.8mm HD95；跨域性能差距降低40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用框架，无需大幅修改基础模型架构，显著提升性能并解决关键挑战。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成先验的方法，从单视角的自我中心图像重建可动画的虚拟形象，利用Stable Diffusion减少训练负担并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字远程呈现需要准确复制人的身体、服装和动作，但自我中心视角存在遮挡和身体比例失真的问题，现有方法依赖多视角数据训练。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet，提出从遮挡的俯视图像生成真实正面视图的流程，并将其输入图像到动作模型生成虚拟形象动作。

Result: 首次使用生成主干从自我中心输入重建可动画的虚拟形象，减少了训练负担并提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为更易用和通用的远程呈现系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

Conclusion: 为计算创造力和艺术教育提供了新视角。

Abstract: Artistic image assessment has become a prominent research area in computer
vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别方法存在上下文偏差问题，即背景与情感标签之间的虚假关联（如将花园与快乐关联），影响了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AGCD-Net，包含Hybrid ConvNeXt（结合Spatial Transformer Network和Squeeze-and-Excitation层）和AG-CIM模块（基于因果理论的注意力引导干预）。

Conclusion: AGCD-Net通过因果去偏显著提升了复杂场景下的情感识别鲁棒性。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊性方面存在不足，尤其是软正负样本问题及未充分利用训练批次中的邻域关系。

Method: AAHR采用动态聚类原型对比学习构建统一表示空间，引入全局/局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN及动量对比学习。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上优于现有方法，显著提升匹配准确性和效率。

Conclusion: AAHR有效解决了语义模糊性和高阶关系学习问题，为图像-文本匹配提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中性能超越现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少计算需求的同时提升性能，验证了标记化与对齐策略的潜力。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust通过自动化提示工程提升了MLLMs在安全关键场景中的可信度，具有潜在的可扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效缓解了初始模糊核的敏感性，提升了BMD性能，并具有即插即用的灵活性。

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架能轻松整合额外元数据（如房间标签），进一步提升准确性和效率。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Motivation: 利用Vision Transformer的表征能力，改进少样本分类中的原型网络性能。

Method: 将ViT-Small作为主干网络，通过平均支持样本的token嵌入构建原型，评估其在多个标准数据集上的表现。

Result: 在5-shot设置下，ViT-ProtoNet性能提升3.2%，特征可分性更强，且轻量级主干表现优异。

Conclusion: ViT-ProtoNet为少样本分类提供了强大且灵活的方法，并成为Transformer元学习的新基准。

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合路径角度自由度的深度角A*（DAA*）方法，通过自适应路径平滑提高路径相似性，在多个数据集中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路径平滑在专家演示的路径模仿学习中常被忽视，本文旨在通过引入路径角度自由度（PAF）改进路径相似性。

Method: 提出DAA*方法，结合PAF探索移动角度对路径节点扩展的影响，通过路径缩短和平滑的联合优化提高路径最优性。

Result: 在7个数据集中，DAA*在路径相似性上显著优于神经A*和TransPath，路径长度更短，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: DAA*通过自适应路径平滑显著提升了路径相似性和最优性，同时讨论了路径最优性与搜索效率的权衡。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成透明或分层内容（RGBA 图像）方面研究不足，缺乏大规模基准测试。

Method: 提出 ALPHA 基准测试和 ALPHAVAE 模型，结合多种损失函数训练，扩展预训练的 RGB VAE。

Result: ALPHAVAE 在仅使用 8K 图像训练的情况下，PSNR 提升 4.9 dB，SSIM 提升 3.2%，生成效果优于 LayerDiffuse。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE 在透明图像生成方面表现优异，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

Motivation: 随着多模态对话系统的研究增多，用户期望系统能更主动交互，例如在视频播放时自主决定多轮响应时机。

Method: 提出ProactiveBench基准和PAUC指标，考虑响应时间动态性，并通过用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好，能更准确地评估主动交互场景下的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态对话系统的发展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频预训练范式仅关注整体模态对齐，忽略了通过认知归纳和对比强化易混淆类别的区分能力。

Method: 提出DICCAE编码器，动态调整混淆损失以解决类别混淆问题，并引入结合音频、视频及其融合的新型训练框架。为解决数据稀缺问题，提出聚类引导的自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在VGGSound数据集上达到65.5%的top-1准确率，并通过消融实验验证了各模块的必要性。

Conclusion: DICCAE通过细粒度类别级对齐和动态混淆损失，显著提升了模型对相似活动的区分能力，为音频-视频任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Motivation: 3D多模态大语言模型的计算效率低，主要由于处理过多的对象中心视觉令牌。现有2D令牌修剪方法不适用于3D领域。

Method: 提出Fast3D框架，包括全局注意力预测（GAP）和样本自适应修剪（SAP），无需修改目标模型参数。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了Fast3D的有效性，尤其在高视觉令牌修剪率下表现优异。

Conclusion: Fast3D显著提升了3D多模态大语言模型的计算效率，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练的简单编码器架构（Video ViTs），用于交通异常检测（TAD），发现其性能优于复杂方法，并探讨了预训练策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过简单的架构（如Video ViTs）结合预训练，实现高效的交通异常检测，而非依赖复杂的多阶段或多表示融合方法。

Method: 使用简单的编码器架构（Video ViTs），研究不同预训练策略（如自监督的Masked Video Modeling和领域自适应预训练）对TAD性能的影响。

Result: 发现强预训练使简单模型性能匹配或超越复杂方法；自监督预训练效果最佳；领域自适应预训练进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合有效预训练可构建高效、可扩展的TAD模型。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 该模型通过高效时空设计，成功平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明CKAA在性能上优于现有的参数高效微调方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过特征对齐和自适应知识聚合，显著提升了模型在持续学习任务中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP等现有模型。

Conclusion: 双曲空间中的MIM和知识蒸馏技术能够高效捕捉视觉-语义层次结构，并在下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

*Yiyang Zhou,Linjie Li,Shi Qiu,Zhengyuan Yang,Yuyang Zhao,Siwei Han,Yangfan He,Kangqi Li,Haonian Ji,Zihao Zhao,Haibo Tong,Lijuan Wang,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频理解基准测试，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正进行视频思考，而非仅依赖关键帧或文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试多基于静态图像，无法评估模型是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，覆盖11个类别，要求完整观看视频并推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，但最佳LVLM模型仅达66.43%，显示模型仍难以超越表面推理。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在视频理解上的局限性，需进一步改进以实现真正的视频思考。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

*Fuyin Ye,Erwen Yao,Jianyong Chen,Fengmei He,Junxiang Zhang,Lihao Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合张量分解和正则化机制的自适应张量正则化网络（SDTN）及轻量级网络（TRN），用于高光谱图像分类，显著提升精度并降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理高维数据、光谱-空间冗余和标记样本稀缺时表现不佳，需改进。

Method: SDTN动态调整张量秩以优化特征表示，TRN整合SDTN特征并捕获多尺度光谱-空间特征。

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上实验显示，相比现有方法，精度显著提升且模型参数减少。

Conclusion: 该方法适合资源受限环境中的实时部署，为高光谱图像分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [122] [Advancing Reliable Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models under Visual Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09500)
*Yiwen Liang,Hui Chen,Yizhe Xiong,Zihan Zhou,Mengyao Lyu,Zijia Lin,Shuaicheng Niu,Sicheng Zhao,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可靠的测试时适应方法（ReTA），通过一致性感知熵重加权（CER）和多样性驱动的分布校准（DDC）解决缓存方法在分布偏移下的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据时对分布偏移的适应能力不足，测试时适应（TTA）方法因此被提出以提升性能。

Method: ReTA结合CER和DDC：CER通过一致性约束加权熵以优化缓存更新；DDC将类级文本嵌入建模为高斯分布，以动态调整决策边界。

Result: 实验表明，ReTA在真实分布偏移下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过增强缓存可靠性和决策边界灵活性，显著提升了VLM在分布偏移下的适应能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HFUT-VUT团队提出了一种用于微手势在线识别的新方法，结合数据增强和时空注意力机制，显著提升了性能，并在IJCAI 2025 MiGA挑战赛中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势在线识别任务具有挑战性，需精确定位时间位置并区分类别，且微手势与其他人类动作差异较大。

Method: 采用手工数据增强和时空注意力机制，提升模型对微手势的分类和定位能力。

Result: F1分数达到38.03，比之前的最佳方法提升了37.9%，排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法在微手势识别任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

### [124] [QuarterMap: Efficient Post-Training Token Pruning for Visual State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09514)
*Tien-Yu Chi,Hung-Yueh Chiang,Diana Marculescu,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuarterMap是一种后训练激活剪枝方法，通过移除冗余空间激活并恢复维度，提升VMamba等SSM模型的吞吐量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少SSM模型（如VMamba）的空间冗余，提升效率而不需重新训练。

Method: 提出QuarterMap方法，剪枝冗余激活后通过最近邻上采样恢复维度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现11%速度提升，精度下降小于0.9%；在ADE20K和MedMamba上同样有效。

Conclusion: QuarterMap是一种即插即用的部署效率工具，适用于SSM模型，优于ToMe等方法。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

*Yunwei Lan,Zhigao Cui,Xin Luo,Chang Liu,Nian Wang,Menglin Zhang,Yanzhao Su,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，通过最优传输理论和细节保留正则化，生成高质量去雾图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限，效果受限。

Method: 利用最优传输理论直接桥接雾图和清晰图的分布，引入细节保留正则化和基于CLIP的提示学习。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct是一种多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的标记化策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，减少了计算冗余，并在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉标记化方法效率低下，导致计算和内存浪费。

Method: 提出VDInstruct模型，采用内容感知的标记化策略，根据文档复杂度生成标记，并结合三阶段训练范式。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，减少图像标记约3.6倍，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线5.5分。

Conclusion: 内容感知标记化与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态RPCA网络（DRPCA-Net），通过深度展开网络将稀疏性先验整合到可学习架构中，显著提升了红外小目标检测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在红外小目标检测中过于复杂且忽视稀疏性先验，导致模型可解释性和效率不足。

Method: 结合模型驱动的RPCA范式，设计动态展开机制和动态残差组模块，自适应生成参数并优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态机制和稀疏性先验的整合，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外图像中远距离密集小目标群因光学限制而混合成斑点的问题，填补高质量公开数据集的空白。

Method: 提出DeRefNet框架，引入TDFA模块实现帧间信息自适应聚合，并贡献SeqCSIST数据集和工具包。

Result: 在SeqCSIST数据集上，DeRefNet的mAP指标比现有方法提升5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST Unmixing任务，数据集和工具包已开源。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视指尖和手腕关节的重要性，导致远端关节误差累积，影响整体姿态估计质量。

Method: EHPE分为两个阶段：TW-stage提取指尖和手腕关节，PG-stage通过双分支交互网络优化其余关节位置。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段架构有效减少误差累积，显著提升了手部姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available
at https://github.com/SereinNout/EHPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术字体设计依赖手工，现有生成模型缺乏交互性和灵活性，无法满足用户对局部编辑、多字符组合和开放式提示的需求。

Method: WordCraft采用无训练的局部注意力机制和噪声混合技术，结合大语言模型解析用户提示，实现高质量字体生成。

Result: 系统支持单字符和多字符输入，跨语言生成高质量艺术字体，显著提升交互性和用户工作流程。

Conclusion: WordCraft为艺术家和设计师提供了更灵活的创意工具，推动了艺术字体合成的交互性和多样性。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在精确视觉控制和多模态输入平衡方面表现不佳，且需要大量训练资源。

Method: MENTOR采用两阶段训练范式：多模态对齐阶段和多模态指令调整阶段，无需依赖辅助适配器或交叉注意力模块。

Result: MENTOR在DreamBench++基准测试中表现优异，在概念保留和提示跟随方面优于基线方法，同时具有更高的图像重建保真度和训练效率。

Conclusion: MENTOR通过创新的两阶段训练框架，显著提升了多模态图像生成的精确性和效率。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别比SAM2提升4.36%和6.1%。

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在无需额外参数或训练的情况下，展示了在手术视频分割中的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

*You Huang,Lichao Chen,Jiayi Ji,Liujuan Cao,Shengchuan Zhang,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inter2Former通过优化密集令牌处理的计算分配，提出四种关键改进，以在CPU设备上实现高效且高质量的交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密集令牌方法在CPU设备上处理速度慢，而稀疏令牌方法（如SAM）牺牲了分割质量。Inter2Former旨在解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 提出动态提示嵌入（DPE）、动态混合注意力（DHA）、混合专家（HMoE）和动态局部上采样（DLU）四种改进。

Result: 在高精度交互式分割基准测试中，Inter2Former在CPU设备上实现了SOTA性能和高效率。

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过计算优化，在保持高质量分割的同时显著提升了处理速度。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

*Eman Ali,Sathira Silva,Chetan Arora,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAIR方法通过动态对齐图像和文本特征，改进了无监督适应中的伪标签生成，显著提升了细粒度分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督适应中无法捕捉细粒度类别差异或计算成本高，FAIR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FAIR通过类描述锚点（CDA）和学习对齐分数（LAS）动态对齐图像和文本特征，并提出自训练加权机制优化伪标签。

Result: FAIR在13个细粒度数据集上平均性能提升2.78%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态跨模态交互和伪标签优化，显著提升了细粒度无监督适应性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAA是一个基于区域引导的少样本异常图像-掩码对生成框架，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型生成真实、多样且语义对齐的异常样本，解决了现有方法在真实性和泛化性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业制造中异常检测样本稀缺，现有异常合成方法存在真实感低、掩码对齐不准确和泛化性差的问题。

Method: GAA通过局部概念分解联合建模异常语义特征和空间信息，利用自适应多轮异常聚类增强表示一致性，并通过区域引导掩码生成策略和低质量样本过滤模块提升生成质量。

Result: 在MVTec AD和LOCO数据集上的实验表明，GAA在异常合成质量和下游任务（如定位和分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAA框架显著提升了异常合成的真实性和泛化性，为工业制造中的异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球主要死因之一，早期准确诊断对改善患者预后至关重要，尤其是在紧急情况下。CT扫描因其快速、可及性和成本效益成为关键成像方式。

Method: 采用MaxViT作为主要深度学习模型，结合其他Transformer变体（如Vision Transformer和ConvNext），并应用数据增强技术（包括合成图像生成）以提升模型泛化能力。

Result: MaxViT模型在增强数据训练下表现最佳，准确率和F1分数达98.00%，优于其他模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究开发了一种可信赖的AI辅助诊断工具，结合XAI技术（如Grad-CAM++），为早期中风检测提供了准确、可解释且临床适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是导致工作年龄成年人视力丧失的主要原因，传统筛查成本高且难以普及。AI算法提供了可扩展的诊断方案，但公平性和泛化性仍是问题。

Method: 使用mBRSET眼底数据集，训练ConvNeXt V2、DINOv2和Swin V2模型预测DR及敏感属性（如年龄和性别），评估公平性并应用解缠技术减少偏见。

Result: 所有模型在DR预测中表现优异（最高94% AUROC），但对年龄和性别的预测能力不同。公平性评估显示子群间差异，解缠技术对模型效果不一。

Conclusion: 研究强调了医学影像AI中公平性的重要性，解缠技术对减少偏见的效果因模型而异，需进一步探索以实现公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性学习显著提升了眼部分割的鲁棒性和准确性，适用于AR/VR中的视线估计任务。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a
reliable and privacy-aware solution for continuous human motion analysis in
indoor environments. Our codes are available in

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Motivation: 当前视频推理方法主要依赖文本信息，忽视了视觉模态的重要性，而人类在推理时会自然结合视觉内容。

Method: 构建了Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB)，并提出了ViTCoT范式，结合视觉和文本信息进行推理。

Result: 实验表明ViTCoT显著优于传统文本CoT范式，并激活了更多MLLMs的神经元值。

Conclusion: ViTCoT提供了一种更直观且认知对齐的视频推理方法，为视频理解领域带来新视角。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Result: 令牌压缩对标准ViT有效，但对紧凑ViT表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在边缘AI中优化紧凑Transformer提供了实践指导和研究方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Motivation: 传统变分分数蒸馏（VSD）方法在实践中存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题，作者希望通过优化方法改进生成质量。

Method: 作者分析了VSD中分数模型与3D模型的交互问题，提出调整优化顺序并使用线性化模型进行分数蒸馏，从而实现了$L^2$-VSD方法。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD通过优化分数蒸馏过程，显著提升了文本到3D生成的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉-语言模型（VLMs）是否以类似人类认知的方式整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用基于提示的概率评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析，对比人类实验数据。

Result: 模型未能表现出稳定的bouba-kiki效应，且与人类数据相比表现显著不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限性，与人类认知不一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance
improvements.

### [149] [NegRefine: Refining Negative Label-Based Zero-Shot OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09795)
*Amirhossein Ansari,Ke Wang,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegRefine提出了一种新的负标签细化框架，用于零样本OOD检测，通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，提高了检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判问题，尤其是当负标签是分布内标签的子类别或专有名词时。此外，这些方法难以处理同时匹配多个标签的图像。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除负标签集中的子类别标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，动态调整多个标签对图像的贡献。

Result: 在包括ImageNet-1K在内的大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现优异。

Conclusion: NegRefine显著提升了零样本OOD检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is
available at https://github.com/ah-ansari/NegRefine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决目前缺乏标准化基准来定量评估多模态大语言模型在涉及弱势道路使用者的复杂、安全关键场景中的推理能力的问题。

Method: 提出了VRU-Accident基准，包含1K真实事故视频、6K多选题对和1K密集场景描述，重点关注弱势道路使用者与车辆的碰撞。

Result: 评估了17个先进模型，发现其在视觉基础属性上表现良好，但在事故原因、类型和可预防性推理方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了现有基准的空白，揭示了多模态大语言模型在安全关键场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了人类和深度学习模型在识别3D物体形状时的表现差异，发现视觉变换器模型更接近人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型是否形成与人类相似的3D形状表征，以理解其识别机制。

Method: 通过实验系统操纵点密度、物体方向和局部几何结构，比较人类与两种深度学习模型（DGCNN和点变换器）的表现。

Result: 点变换器模型在模拟人类表现上优于卷积模型，因其支持3D形状的层次抽象。

Conclusion: 点变换器模型更接近人类3D形状表征，揭示了其机制优势。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力，限制了其在面部结构、表情、情感等任务中的应用。

Method: 提出弱监督流程，利用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的图像-文本对（FairFaceGPT），训练专用于面部理解的FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖的多模态AI系统树立了先例。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant
breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer
high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to

human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M
dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.

TL;DR: 论文提出CrisisLandMark数据集和CLOSP框架，通过文本对齐光学与SAR图像，提升检索性能54%，并整合地理坐标实现更精准的危机事件检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能充分利用多传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的物理信息，限制了遥感档案的潜力。

Method: 引入CrisisLandMark数据集（64.7万张图像与文本标注），提出CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像嵌入空间，并扩展为GeoCLOSP整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP在检索性能上提升54% nDGC，GeoCLOSP在位置相关任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理背景的整合对释放遥感档案潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、接近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS框架显著提升反事实解释的质量，为AI模型的可解释性提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的高光谱重建方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽略了从低维到高维信息转换的固有挑战。

Method: MCGA采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式，提取混合码本（MoC）；第二阶段通过查询MoC特征优化RGB到HSI映射。还引入了灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力。

Result: MCGA在实验中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过结合先验知识和物理驱动的注意力机制，提供了轻量且高效的高光谱重建解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在被动任务中表现良好，但在需要在线交互和主动场景理解的具身环境中表现有限。

Method: 通过EmRACE-3K数据集（包含3,000多个语言引导任务）评估模型，并采用监督学习和强化学习微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 零样本设置下模型成功率低于20%，微调后模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K数据集有效推动了具身推理能力的发展，揭示了当前模型的不足和改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变性对航空图像检测器性能有显著提升，多分支头设计有效平衡了参数与精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图形设计方法缺乏创造力和智能性，且生成的文件不可编辑，文本渲染效果差。

Result: 实验结果表明，IGD在复杂图形设计任务中具有可扩展性和扩展性，提供了新的解决方案。

Conclusion: IGD为自动化图形设计提供了高效、灵活且可编辑的新方法。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute

TL;DR: 提出Crucial-Diff框架，通过生成关键样本解决数据稀缺问题，提升检测和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成方法合成的样本重复或简单，无法针对下游模型的弱点提供关键信息。

Method: 结合Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE)和Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM)模块，生成多样且高质量的样本。

Result: 在MVTec上达到83.63%的像素级AP和78.12%的F1-MAX；在息肉数据集上达到81.64%的mIoU和87.69%的mDice。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff能有效生成关键样本，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚零售业务依赖于对产品的理解，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在细粒度时尚属性识别方面的性能尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，仅以图像为输入，评估两种LLMs在18个时尚属性类别中的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: 研究为电商产品属性任务提供了实用见解，并强调了领域特定微调的重要性，为未来时尚AI研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜在原子分辨率下对材料的结构-性能关系研究至关重要，但辐射损伤限制了其在光束敏感材料（如蛋白质和2D材料）中的应用。

Method: 通过多图像超分辨率（MISR）和卷积神经网络（CNN）融合多个低分辨率图像，开发了一种双路径注意力引导网络，用于4D-STEM。

Result: 在超低剂量条件下，实现了与传统ptychography相当的空间分辨率，适用于无定形、半晶和晶态光束敏感样品。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖KL散度估计不确定性，忽略了模态间的领域差异，KPHD-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Kalman滤波器进行多视图融合。

Result: 实验表明KPHD-Net在分类和聚类任务中优于现有方法，具有更高的准确性、鲁棒性和可靠性。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的不确定性估计和多视图融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM

Conclusion: 3DGAA是一种实用的对抗攻击框架，可用于评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性，为物理可实现的对抗攻击设定了新标准。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的相位移相轮廓术（PSP）方法，通过图像序列的二项式自补偿（I-BSC）解决动态测量中的运动误差问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和误差累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PSP在动态测量中因物体运动导致误差，现有方法P-BSC虽有效但计算开销大且存在误差累积。

Method: 提出I-BSC方法，通过加权求和同质条纹图像而非相位帧，仅需一次反正切计算，降低计算复杂度。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差的同时实现准单帧速率，计算帧率提升数倍至数十倍，且误差收敛更快。

Conclusion: I-BSC显著优于现有方法，适用于高像素-深度-时间分辨率的3D重建。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

Result: 实验表明，Hyma将最优单模态模型对的搜索成本降低10倍，同时保持与网格搜索相当的性能。

Conclusion: Hyma是一种高效的多模态模型构建方法，显著降低了计算成本，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，提升了模型适应性和性能。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Result: 在多个任务中验证了模型的有效性和高效性，性能竞争性强且速度大幅提升。

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模动态场景，支持多任务学习和零样本应用，具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的频率域调节机制，通过分析扩散过程中预测噪声图像的能量变化，有效解决了曝光偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成能力上表现出色，但受曝光偏差影响显著。作者观察到预测噪声图像能量在扩散过程中减少，并发现这种减少在低频和高频子带中有不同模式，导致重建数据与真实数据之间的幅度差异。

Method: 通过小波变换分别调节低频和高频子带，提出了一种无需训练、即插即用的频率域调节机制，并更准确地分析了曝光偏差在子带中的表现。

Result: 该方法显著提升了多种扩散模型的生成质量，为不同架构的模型提供了解决曝光偏差的稳健方案。

Conclusion: 基于能量变化的频率域调节机制是一种高效且通用的方法，能够有效改善扩散模型的生成性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Result: IoU从25.50%提升至64.84%，显著改善性能。

Conclusion: 策略有效解决域差异问题，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供高精度信息提取技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: FIX-CLIP有效解决了CLIP的长文本处理问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

Motivation: 解决多摄像头环境下目标跟踪中身份一致性的挑战。

Method: 使用BoT-SORT进行单摄像头跟踪，通过轨迹特征匹配初始化全局ID，后续采用优先全局匹配策略。

Conclusion: 该框架在多摄像头多目标跟踪中表现高效且准确。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera multi-target (MCMT) tracking framework that ensures
consistent global identity assignment across views using trajectory and
appearance cues. The pipeline starts with BoT-SORT-based single-camera
tracking, followed by an initial glance phase to initialize global IDs via
trajectory-feature matching. In later frames, new tracklets are matched to
existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or
feature match is found. 3D positions are estimated using depth maps and
calibration for spatial validation.

Motivation: 解决像素级标注成本高的问题，探索基础模型在半监督分割中的有效利用。

Method: 结合无监督掩码变换一致性和CLIP的零样本分类增强识别，利用SAM伪标签进行类无关解码器预热以提升定位。

Result: 在ADE20K数据集上仅用158张标注图像取得29.9 PQ和38.9 mIoU，性能优于现有方法且GPU内存需求更低。

Conclusion: DEARLi在标签稀缺和大分类任务中表现突出，为半监督分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

Conclusion: 提出的方法在超声心动图中表现出更好的性能和泛化能力，临床评估显示其与专家验证工具更接近，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 生物视觉系统依赖反馈连接优化感知，而人工神经网络多为前馈结构，缺乏迭代优化能力。

Method: 在U-Net架构中引入反馈循环，结合软最大投影和指数衰减确保稳定性，并在合成分割任务中验证。

Result: 反馈模型在噪声条件下表现更优，仅需两个训练样本即可超越随机性能，而前馈模型需至少四个。

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了鲁棒性和数据效率，为更适应性和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: 双级域适应方法有效解决了合成与真实数据之间的域差距，提升了文本人物检索的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，因固定分辨率训练导致细节丢失或泛化能力差。

Method: 提出ECP框架：先通过降采样图像获取粗略预测定位候选区域，再基于候选区域进行最终预测。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像上的性能问题，保留细节并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了ARL的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: ARL无需额外参数，适用于不同结构和融合方法的多模态模型。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Conclusion: 结论指出情绪普遍性假设存在过度简化，种族背景在情绪表达分析中是一个重要因素。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 多模态学习常因优化不足导致性能不如单模态学习，现有方法未能解释主导模态在多模态模型中表现不佳的原因。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失对模态编码器的梯度并用单模态损失梯度替代，同时移除单模态损失对融合模块的梯度，以解耦优化。

Result: 实验表明DGL在多种模态、任务和框架中有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL通过解耦优化过程，显著提升了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人体图像生成面临计算成本高和实时性不足的问题，现有方法需要大量数据或推理时微调。

Method: 使用LoRA层训练，结合衣柜条件和空间参考减少信息丢失，并引入选择性主体区域损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，无需额外参数即可生成高质量图像。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA为个性化人体图像生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and

*Jimin Dai,Jiexi Yan,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

TL;DR: VRFNO通过噪声优化和速度场改进，解决了Reflow在快速生成高质量图像时的局限性，显著提升单步和少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflow在训练中通过确定性耦合改进图像生成质量，但存在分布差距问题，无法快速生成高质量图像。

Method: 提出VRFNO框架，结合编码器和神经速度场，引入历史速度项和噪声优化，优化耦合以提升生成效果。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，在单步和少步生成任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO通过创新设计有效解决了Reflow的局限性，提升了图像生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

### [193] [Spatial Lifting for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10222)
*Mingzhi Xu,Yizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spatial Lifting（SL）的新方法，通过将输入（如2D图像）提升到高维空间进行处理，显著减少了模型参数和推理成本，同时在密集预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集预测方法通常需要大量参数和计算资源，SL旨在通过维度提升来降低这些成本，同时保持或提升性能。

Method: SL将标准输入（如2D图像）提升到高维空间（如3D），并使用对应维度的网络（如3D U-Net）进行处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集（13个语义分割和6个深度估计）上验证，SL在减少98%参数的同时，性能与常规方法相当。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种更高效、准确和可靠的建模范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Motivation: 假肢步态分析对康复至关重要，但现有视觉方法在假肢检测和分析上存在挑战。

Method: 提出ProGait数据集，包含412个视频片段，支持多种视觉任务，并提供了基线模型。

Result: 基线模型在假肢特定任务上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProGait数据集为假肢步态分析提供了实用工具，并展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉语言模型在检测分布外（OOD）样本时，对靠近分布内（InD）数据的挑战性OOD样本仍存在误分类问题。

Method: 采用基础模型（如扩散模型和多模态大语言模型）生成合成OOD数据，通过迭代修复和噪声调整优化样本，并微调CLIP模型以增强边界区分能力。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，SynOOD性能显著优于现有方法，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界对齐的OOD数据，有效提升了模型的OOD检测能力，且参数和运行时开销极小。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Motivation: 随着生成技术的快速发展，AI生成图像的逼真度已足以欺骗人类，但现有的AID模型在真实场景中表现不佳，亟需改进。

Result: 通过优化上述因素，AID模型在真实场景中的AUC平均提升了26.87%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AID模型在真实场景中的关键改进方向，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the
quality of AI-generated images has reached a level that can easily deceive even
the most discerning observers. Our systematic evaluation highlights a critical
weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Result: 风格迁移显著减少纹理偏差，提升对图像损坏和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中具有普适性，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏输入的物体中心场景中，背景纹理可能显著影响相机姿态估计的准确性，因此需要一种有效的攻击方法。

Method: 使用相同片段形成多折径向对称的圆盘，并提出投影方向一致性损失优化这些片段。

Result: 优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机姿态估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法通过优化背景纹理显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的标记生成显著提升了图像分类性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化情况下难以保留身份特征，导致结果缺乏个体特性。

Method: IP-FVR结合参考图像的语义信息，采用解耦交叉注意力机制、反馈学习和指数混合策略，确保帧内和帧间身份一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，IP-FVR在质量和身份保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在面部视频恢复中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Result: 实验表明，DisCo在多个视频理解基准上显著优于现有方法，同时提高了标记效率。

Conclusion: DisCo通过创新的视觉封装方法，解决了视频MLLMs中的关键问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Result: 在Phoenix-2014T基准测试中表现优于单流变体，取得最高BLEU-4分数。

Conclusion: 双编码器框架为无注释手语翻译提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Result: IMD在常用基准测试中达到新SOTA，在IMIM基准上提升12%。

Conclusion: IMD有效解决了基础模型与特征匹配需求的对齐问题，显著提升了多实例场景下的性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Conclusion: FGSSNet通过特征引导显著提升了墙体分割性能。

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了VRGAdapter的有效性。

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，并通过不确定性引导的多分支融合提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出并解决了一个新问题——细粒度零样本目标检测（FG-ZSD），开发了一种基于改进两阶段检测器的有效方法MSHC，并构建了首个FG-ZSD基准数据集FGZSD-Birds。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象，而现实场景中常需区分细粒度对象（如不同鸟类、鱼类和花卉）。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: FG-ZSD是一个重要且具有挑战性的问题，MSHC方法在细粒度检测中表现优异。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

TL;DR: FOCAL是一种测试时、数据驱动的框架，利用基础模型的互联网规模视觉先验，通过生成和优化候选变换来实现鲁棒感知，无需重新训练或架构更改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖专用架构或预定义增强训练，限制了泛化能力，需要一种更通用的方法来提升视觉感知的鲁棒性。

Method: FOCAL框架通过生成和优化候选变换，使其趋向视觉典型的“规范”视图，从而增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，FOCAL提升了CLIP和SAM在2D/3D旋转、光照变化和昼夜变化等挑战性变换中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCAL挑战了变换特定训练的必要性，提供了一种可扩展的鲁棒性实现路径。

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,
yet current methods rely heavily on specialized architectures or training on
predefined augmentations, limiting generalization. We propose FOCAL, a
test-time, data-driven framework that achieves robust perception by leveraging
internet-scale visual priors from foundation models. By generating and
optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"
views, FOCAL enhances robustness without re-training or architectural changes.
Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将拓扑数据分析（TDA）特征与深度学习模型结合的方法，提升了遥感图像分类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卷积神经网络（CNN）对纹理特征的偏好问题，探索TDA在复杂数据集中的几何信息量化能力。

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程流程，并将其与ResNet18模型结合，应用于EuroSAT和RESISC45数据集。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到99.33%的准确率，超过ResNet50和XL Vision Transformers；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征可以增强深度学习模型，即使在没有显式拓扑结构的数据集上，扩展了TDA的应用范围。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估AI生成图像时存在语义不对齐和细节感知缺失的问题，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: SC-AGIQA结合文本辅助语义对齐模块（TSAM）和频域细粒度退化感知模块（FFDPM），利用多模态大语言模型和频域分析提升评估效果。

Result: 实验表明，SC-AGIQA在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过语义约束和频域分析显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点拟合参数模型，但关键点获取费时且不可靠。

Method: 提出密集特征网络将2D表示映射到SMAL参数，并开发分层对齐策略整合轮廓、部分级、像素级和时间线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基于模型和无模型的基线方法，生成的高质量3D资产可支持其他3D任务。

Conclusion: 4D-Animal具有大规模应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

Motivation: 珊瑚礁监测需要专业知识，而现有视觉问答技术缺乏针对珊瑚图像的专用数据集。

Result: CoralVQA为珊瑚礁图像中的视觉语言推理提供了基准，并揭示了现有大型视觉语言模型的局限性。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为未来模型开发提供了基础，支持珊瑚保护工作。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

TL;DR: RAPNet提出了一种基于内容自适应卷积的遥感图像融合方法，通过RAPConv和PAN-DFF模块提升空间细节和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在遥感图像融合中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽视局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用RAPConv生成空间自适应卷积核，并结合PAN-DFF模块通过注意力机制优化空间细节与光谱保真度的平衡。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应卷积和动态特征融合显著提升了遥感图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

Motivation: 盲人脸图像恢复因未知的复杂退化问题和对人脸敏感而极具挑战性，现有方法在身份保留上表现不佳。

Result: 实验表明，RefSTAR在多种骨干模型上表现优异，身份保留能力和参考特征转移质量更好。

Conclusion: RefSTAR通过有效整合参考图像特征，显著提升了盲人脸图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

Result: GT-Loc在时间预测上超越现有方法，即使使用真实地理位置输入，同时在地理定位任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间与地理定位，实现了高效的时间预测和地理定位，支持组合和基于文本的图像检索。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，导航系统成功率95%，综合准确率达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效可靠，隐私保护性强，适用于老年人跌倒检测。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

Conclusion: 所提方法高效且性能优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估和改进方向，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at

Result: 实验表明，相对相机条件化能提升新视图合成性能，PRoPE进一步带来增益，且在不同任务和模型规模中均有效。

Conclusion: PRoPE在多视图Transformer中表现优越，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

*Borui Zhang,Qihang Rao,Wenzhao Zheng,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQ框架通过预训练的VAE快速训练VQ-VAE，显著降低计算成本，同时保持高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高压缩率VQ-VAE训练计算成本高，需数千GPU小时，ReVQ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE，通过控制量化噪声和引入通道多组量化与后矫正器，实现高效训练。

Result: ReVQ在单张NVIDIA 4090上22小时完成训练，重建质量保持竞争力（rFID = 1.06）。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量间取得优越平衡，显著降低训练成本。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

Result: 在Bossou等挑战性基准测试中，性能优于监督方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在生物多样性监测中具有潜力，为可扩展的非侵入性种群研究铺平道路。

Abstract: Camera traps are revolutionising wildlife monitoring by capturing vast
amounts of visual data; however, the manual identification of individual
animals remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces a fully
self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.

*Huilai Li,Yonghao Dang,Ying Xing,Yiming Wang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ESG-Net的方法，通过多阶段语义引导和多事件关系建模，解决了密集视听事件定位中的模态语义鸿沟和事件相关性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在中间层缺乏跨模态语义桥接，导致模态语义鸿沟，且未考虑事件间的相关性，限制了模型在复杂场景中的性能。

Method: ESG-Net包含早期语义交互模块（ESI）和依赖专家混合模块（MoDE），分别用于多阶段语义引导和多事件依赖关系建模。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有技术，同时大幅减少了参数和计算量。

Conclusion: ESG-Net通过分层语义理解和自适应事件依赖提取，有效提升了密集视听事件定位的性能。

Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event
categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies
only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking
cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality
semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between
event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely
consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer
concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate
multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which
respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events
and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on
event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network
(ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of
dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to
explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through
multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring
hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the
extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of
experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly
reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on
https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.

TL;DR: LayLens是一个工具，通过三阶段流程（检测、简化解释、视觉重建）帮助用户理解深度伪造内容，提升透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度伪造检测工具技术术语过多的问题，使不同教育背景的用户都能理解。

Method: 1. 使用先进的伪造定位模型进行检测；2. 通过视觉语言模型简化技术解释；3. 通过图像编辑重建原始图像。

Result: 用户研究表明，简化解释显著提高了清晰度并降低了认知负担，用户对识别深度伪造的信心增强。

Conclusion: LayLens推动了透明、可信且以用户为中心的深度伪造取证工具的发展。

Abstract: This demonstration paper presents $\mathbf{LayLens}$, a tool aimed to make
deepfake understanding easier for users of all educational backgrounds. While
prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges
the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage
pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery
localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical
explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a
plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both
technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side
comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15
participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity
and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in
identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy,
and user-centric deepfake forensics.

*Tianzhe Zhao,Jiaoyan Chen,Yanchi Ru,Haiping Zhu,Nan Hu,Jun Liu,Qika Lin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了基于知识图谱的检索增强生成（KG-RAG）方法的安全性问题，提出了一种隐蔽的数据投毒攻击策略，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KG-RAG方法在增强语言模型性能方面表现出色，但其结构化特性可能带来独特的安全风险，目前尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种针对KG-RAG的隐蔽攻击策略，通过插入扰动三元组误导推理链，并在两个基准和四种KG-RAG方法上进行了实验验证。

Result: 攻击策略显著降低了KG-RAG的性能，即使仅对知识图谱进行最小扰动。

Conclusion: KG-RAG系统存在严重的安全漏洞，需要进一步研究防御机制以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external data to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge
issues. Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources
and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been
increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG)
methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent
studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where
malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the
system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies
focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources,
leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that
KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature.
In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security
issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we
introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world
implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial
target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading
inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods
retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive
experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack
strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance,
even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to
understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and
to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督框架，利用Transformer嵌入和对比学习，自动检测、聚类和优先处理黑客论坛中的安全事件，有效减少噪声并识别高优先级威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑客论坛的内容虽能提供网络安全威胁的早期信号，但其非结构化和噪声多的特点使得提取可操作情报具有挑战性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的嵌入和对比学习，对论坛帖子进行聚类，并通过量化指标（如及时性、来源可信度等）对事件进行每日排名。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能有效减少噪声并识别高优先级威胁，帮助安全分析师采取主动响应。

Conclusion: 该框架将分散的黑客论坛讨论转化为结构化情报，解决了自动威胁检测和分析中的基本挑战。

Abstract: Hacker forums provide critical early warning signals for emerging
cybersecurity threats, but extracting actionable intelligence from their
unstructured and noisy content remains a significant challenge. This paper
presents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and
prioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach
leverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to
group related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying
incidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on
predefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that
prioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness,
source credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental
evaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method
effectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security
analysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum
discussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses
fundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis.

TL;DR: TREC Deep Learning track第五年，基于MS MARCO数据集，重复去年设计，引入合成查询（T5和GPT-4生成），发现LLM提示方法优于往年最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过更难的测试集和合成查询，评估模型性能，探索LLM在排序任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用MS MARCO v2数据集，结合人工和合成查询（T5和GPT-4生成），评估模型表现。

Result: LLM提示方法优于往年最佳方法，合成查询与人工查询结果一致（τ=0.8487），未发现明显偏差。

Conclusion: LLM在排序任务中表现优异，合成查询可作为补充，未来可探索更多提示方法。

Abstract: This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of
human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set,
based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with
passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using
labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO
queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike
the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more
difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO
(human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a
fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.
  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model
(LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach,
which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last
year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in
other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not
just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar
results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$.
However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries
that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4
were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using
T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在结构化辩论中的表现及其评估能力，以验证其在辩论任务中的实用性。

Method: 使用六个公开可用的LLMs模型进行检索增强辩论和评估，通过质量、数量、方式和相关性四个指标进行评估。

Result: LLMs在辩论中表现良好，但回答冗长；评估结果一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在辩论任务中具有潜力，但需优化回答长度以提高效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong conversational abilities. In
this Working Paper, we study them in the context of debating in two ways: their
ability to perform in a structured debate along with a dataset of arguments to
use and their ability to evaluate utterances throughout the debate. We deploy
six leading publicly available models from three providers for the
Retrieval-Augmented Debate and Evaluation. The evaluation is performed by
measuring four key metrics: Quality, Quantity, Manner, and Relation. Throughout
this task, we found that although LLMs perform well in debates when given
related arguments, they tend to be verbose in responses yet consistent in
evaluation. The accompanying source code for this paper is located at

TL;DR: MixLoRA-DSI提出了一种结合可扩展的LoRA专家混合和层间OOD驱动扩展策略的新框架，用于高效更新生成检索模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续更新生成检索模型的计算成本高，资源受限时难以实现。

Method: 结合可扩展的LoRA专家混合和OOD驱动扩展策略，仅在检测到显著OOD文档时引入新专家。

Result: 在NQ320k和MS MARCO Passage上表现优于全模型更新基线，参数开销小且训练成本低。

Conclusion: MixLoRA-DSI为高效更新生成检索模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continually updating model-based indexes in generative retrieval with new
documents remains challenging, as full retraining is computationally expensive
and impractical under resource constraints. We propose MixLoRA-DSI, a novel
framework that combines an expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts
with a layer-wise out-of-distribution (OOD)-driven expansion strategy. Instead
of allocating new experts for each new corpus, our proposed expansion strategy
enables sublinear parameter growth by selectively introducing new experts only
when significant number of OOD documents are detected. Experiments on NQ320k
and MS MARCO Passage demonstrate that MixLoRA-DSI outperforms full-model update
baselines, with minimal parameter overhead and substantially lower training
costs.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PRISM是一种新的文档到文档检索方法，通过多粒度表示和匹配改进科学论文检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖摘要作为稀疏的高层总结，无法充分捕捉全文的多样性。

Method: PRISM将查询和候选论文分解为多个特定方面的视图，分别嵌入并匹配。

Result: PRISM平均性能提升4.3%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PRISM通过多粒度表示显著提升科学论文检索效果。

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document
retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query
paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have
focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full
documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide
only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a
novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple,
fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In
particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views
and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers
similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we
present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented
context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then,
experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3%
over existing retrieval baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 现有语音对话生成模型多为自回归，推理速度慢且不稳定，缺乏大规模开源数据集。

Method: 提出ZipVoice-Dialog模型，采用流匹配技术，引入说话人轮换嵌入、课程学习策略和立体声对话生成技术，并构建OpenDialog数据集。

Result: 模型在清晰度、说话人轮换准确性、说话人相似性和推理速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: ZipVoice-Dialog为语音对话生成提供了高效稳定的解决方案，并开源了代码、模型和数据集。

Abstract: Generating spoken dialogue is more challenging than monologue text-to-speech
(TTS) due to the need for realistic turn-taking and distinct speaker timbres.
Existing spoken dialogue generation models, being auto-regressive, suffer from
slow and unstable inference. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
ZipVoice-Dialog, a non-autoregressive zero-shot spoken dialogue generation
model built upon flow matching. Key designs include: 1) speaker-turn embeddings
for precise speaker turn-taking; 2) a curriculum learning strategy for stable
speech-text alignment; 3) specialized strategies to enable stereo dialogue
generation. Additionally, recognizing the lack of open-source large-scale
spoken dialogue datasets, we curated OpenDialog, a 6.8k-hour spoken dialogue
dataset from in-the-wild speech data. Furthermore, we established a benchmark
to comprehensively evaluate various models. Experimental results demonstrate
that ZipVoice-Dialog achieves superior performance in intelligibility, speaker
turn-taking accuracy, speaker similarity, and inference speed. Our codes, model
checkpoints, demo samples, and the OpenDialog dataset are all publicly
available at https://github.com/k2-fsa/ZipVoice.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能像人类评估者一样解释和应用自然语言描述（can-do descriptors）进行第二语言评估。

Method: 使用开源LLM Qwen 2.5 72B在零样本设置下评估S&I Corpus，依赖纯文本信息。

Result: NLA表现接近语音LLM，优于BERT模型，在任务不匹配时效果显著，且通用性强、可解释性高。

Conclusion: NLA是一种通用、可解释且高效的第二语言评估方法，尤其适用于任务不匹配和多语言场景。

Abstract: Natural language-based assessment (NLA) is an approach to second language
assessment that uses instructions - expressed in the form of can-do descriptors
- originally intended for human examiners, aiming to determine whether large
language models (LLMs) can interpret and apply them in ways comparable to human
assessment. In this work, we explore the use of such descriptors with an
open-source LLM, Qwen 2.5 72B, to assess responses from the publicly available
S&I Corpus in a zero-shot setting. Our results show that this approach -
relying solely on textual information - achieves competitive performance: while
it does not outperform state-of-the-art speech LLMs fine-tuned for the task, it
surpasses a BERT-based model trained specifically for this purpose. NLA proves
particularly effective in mismatched task settings, is generalisable to other
data types and languages, and offers greater interpretability, as it is
grounded in clearly explainable, widely applicable language descriptors.

Motivation: 扩展自回归Transformer模型到音频生成领域，解决音频连续性的挑战。

Result: 在AudioCaps上，FAD和KL散度分别提升20%和40%，参数更少。

Conclusion: 方法在性能和效率上均优于现有技术，接近SOTA扩散模型。

Abstract: Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become
a de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable
success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm
to audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We
research audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete
tokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution
of the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant
improvements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40%
relative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a
novel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction
into the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33%
relative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B)
models, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion
models. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer
parameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.

Conclusion: CNeuroMod-THINGS通过整合现有资源，显著提升了人类视觉体验建模的能力。

Abstract: Data-hungry neuro-AI modelling requires ever larger neuroimaging datasets.
CNeuroMod-THINGS meets this need by capturing neural representations for a wide
set of semantic concepts using well-characterized stimuli in a new
densely-sampled, large-scale fMRI dataset. Importantly, CNeuroMod-THINGS
exploits synergies between two existing projects: the THINGS initiative
(THINGS) and the Courtois Project on Neural Modelling (CNeuroMod). THINGS has
developed a common set of thoroughly annotated images broadly sampling natural
and man-made objects which is used to acquire a growing collection of
large-scale multimodal neural responses. Meanwhile, CNeuroMod is acquiring
hundreds of hours of fMRI data from a core set of participants during
controlled and naturalistic tasks, including visual tasks like movie watching
and videogame playing. For CNeuroMod-THINGS, four CNeuroMod participants each
completed 33-36 sessions of a continuous recognition paradigm using
approximately 4000 images from the THINGS stimulus set spanning 720 categories.
We report behavioural and neuroimaging metrics that showcase the quality of the
data. By bridging together large existing resources, CNeuroMod-THINGS expands
our capacity to model broad slices of the human visual experience.

Conclusion: BEAST为行为分析提供了强大且通用的骨干模型，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: The brain can only be fully understood through the lens of the behavior it

experiment-specific vision transformers for diverse neuro-behavior analyses.
BEAST combines masked autoencoding with temporal contrastive learning to
effectively leverage unlabeled video data. Through comprehensive evaluation
across multiple species, we demonstrate improved performance in three critical
neuro-behavioral tasks: extracting behavioral features that correlate with
neural activity, and pose estimation and action segmentation in both the
single- and multi-animal settings. Our method establishes a powerful and
versatile backbone model that accelerates behavioral analysis in scenarios
where labeled data remains scarce.

### [237] [TRACER: Efficient Object Re-Identification in Networked Cameras through Adaptive Query Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09448)
*Pramod Chunduri,Yao Lu,Joy Arulraj*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Tracer是一种新型VDBMS，通过自适应查询处理框架高效处理Re-ID查询，优于现有技术3.9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统Spactula在大型摄像头网络中准确性有限，且不支持自适应查询处理，无法满足高召回需求。

Method: Tracer使用循环网络建模长期历史相关性，并采用概率自适应搜索模型动态优化查询。

Result: Tracer在多种数据集上平均性能提升3.9倍。

Conclusion: Tracer为Re-ID任务提供了高效解决方案，并通过合成基准解决了数据隐私问题。

Abstract: Efficiently re-identifying and tracking objects across a network of cameras
is crucial for applications like traffic surveillance. Spatula is the
state-of-the-art video database management system (VDBMS) for processing Re-ID
queries. However, it suffers from two limitations. Its spatio-temporal
filtering scheme has limited accuracy on large camera networks due to localized
camera history. It is not suitable for critical video analytics applications
that require high recall due to a lack of support for adaptive query
processing.
  In this paper, we present Tracer, a novel VDBMS for efficiently processing
Re-ID queries using an adaptive query processing framework. Tracer selects the
optimal camera to process at each time step by training a recurrent network to
model long-term historical correlations. To accelerate queries under a high
recall constraint, Tracer incorporates a probabilistic adaptive search model
that processes camera feeds in incremental search windows and dynamically
updates the sampling probabilities using an exploration-exploitation strategy.
To address the paucity of benchmarks for the Re-ID task due to privacy
concerns, we present a novel synthetic benchmark for generating multi-camera
Re-ID datasets based on real-world traffic distribution. Our evaluation shows
that Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-camera analytics system by
3.9x on average across diverse datasets.

*Daewon Choi,Jimin Lee,Jihoon Tack,Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过去除推理过程中的冗余来提升大语言模型性能的方法，重点关注注意力稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在长链推理中存在冗余，注意力分散，尤其是在错误答案中更为明显。

Method: 通过测量特殊‘思考结束’标记的注意力分数，系统性识别冗余，并提出结构感知剪枝方法去除低贡献推理块。

Result: 该方法显著提高了推理密集型任务的准确性，尤其在数学竞赛基准测试（如AIME和AMC）中表现突出。

Conclusion: 去除推理冗余能有效提升模型性能，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LRMs生成冗余推理链的问题，以提高效率和实用性。

Method: 综述了简洁和自适应推理的方法论、基准和挑战。

Result: 提供了该领域的全面概述，帮助研究人员快速了解现状。

Conclusion: 希望激发新的自适应推理思路，优化LRMs的使用。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have
demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics
and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences
(slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models
(fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge
that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for
trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference
resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the
practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is
crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning
between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive
thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,
and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers
quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive
thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但其输出存在逻辑不一致问题，需要一种方法在形式推理中利用其广泛的知识。

Method: 将LLM直接整合到一种次协调逻辑的形式语义解释函数中，利用其知识同时保持逻辑的健全性和完备性。

Result: 通过多个短形式事实性基准数据集验证了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号推理提供了理论框架，既能利用LLM的知识，又能保持逻辑的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with
logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs'
broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their
inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the
interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We
provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating
the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality
benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for
neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the
underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Promise Theory的语义时空模型，通过多尺度异常检测和尺度分离，低成本地评估数据中的潜在意图性，适用于基础生物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨意图和意图性在科学与技术中的实际意义，弥补Searle之后的研究空白。

Method: 利用Promise Theory的语义时空模型，通过多尺度异常检测和尺度分离，区分意图内容和环境背景。

Result: 提供了一种低成本、无需大规模训练或推理的潜在意图性评估方法。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于基础生物体，但概念形成水平受代理记忆容量限制。

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of
philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in
science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the
scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective
Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low
level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence
as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent
`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and
assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort
parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime
coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation
of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference
to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the
reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial
probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends,
however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决知识图谱（KG）互操作性研究中SPARQL查询自动翻译的空白。

Method: 使用三种开源LLM（Llama-3-8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B和Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407），通过零样本、少样本和思维链变体测试SPARQL翻译。

Result: 不同模型和提示策略性能差异显著，Wikidata到DBpedia的翻译效果优于反向。

Conclusion: LLM在SPARQL翻译中表现不一，需进一步优化模型和策略。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG)
schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and
later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG
interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on
SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first
align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100
DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic
KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures
and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs
were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find
that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,
and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations
for DBpedia to Wikidata.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化、领域特定的R代码分割方法，使用大语言模型（LLMs）和小语言模型（SLMs），并比较了两种方法：基于行的上下文分析和基于范围的分割。结果显示，基于行的方法更优，且小模型表现优于大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码库规模的增长，手动和语法分析方法变得不切实际，尤其是对于R等低资源语言及其研究领域（如社会科学、心理学），因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出了两种方法：基于行的上下文分析和基于范围的分割，并实验了LLMs和微调的SLMs。还创建了人工标注数据集StatCodeSeg。

Result: 基于行的上下文分析方法优于基于范围的分割，且小模型（如CodeBERT和CodeT5+）表现优于LLMs，尽管它们在预训练中未接触R代码。

Conclusion: 自动化代码分割方法在低资源语言中可行，小模型通过微调可以超越大模型，为领域特定代码分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Source code segmentation, dividing code into functionally coherent segments,
is crucial for knowledge retrieval and maintenance in software development.
While enabling efficient navigation and comprehension of large codebases,
manual and syntactic analysis approaches have become impractical as
repositories grow, especially for low-resource languages like R and their
research domains (e.g., social sciences, psychology).This paper introduces an
automated, domain-specific approach for research R code segmentation using
Large and Small Language Models (LLMs/SLMs). It presents two novel approaches
and a human-annotated dataset, StatCodeSeg. We explore two distinct approaches:
line-by-line analysis with context and range-based segment determination. We
experiment with LLMs and fine-tuned SLMs. To support the generalizability of
our approaches, we also include experiments on Python code from the computer
science domain.Our results show that context-based line-by-line analysis is
superior over range-based segmentation.Using smaller language models like
CodeBERT and an encoder-only version of CodeT5+ are better than their LLM
counterparts. Most notably, these two best-performing models did not see R code
during pre-training versus the LLMs but were only fine-tuned on 4,130 lines of
manually annotated code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖手动收集的测试用例，无法自动检查语义正确性，且忽略了顺序API调用的复杂交互。

Method: StateGen结合状态机API约束求解、基于能量的采样和控制流注入生成可执行程序，并通过两个LLM代理转化为自然语言任务描述。

Result: 构建了StateEval基准测试，包含120个已验证的测试用例，覆盖三个代表性场景。实验表明StateGen能有效生成具有挑战性的API任务。

Conclusion: StateGen为LLM工具使用的测试和评估提供了新方法，揭示了当前LLM在API集成中的改进空间。

Abstract: By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex
real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use
remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually
collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for
semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string
matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex
interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in
real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen,
an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving
sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API
constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow
injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated
into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of
two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark
encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative
scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental
results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and
realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current
LLMs incorporating APIs.

Conclusion: TinyTroupe不仅是一个具体实现，还是一种可应用于其他场景的新概念贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to a new class of
autonomous agents, renewing and expanding interest in the area. LLM-powered
Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation
purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its
distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS
libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population
sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among
other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social
simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this
work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona
definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs,
behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This
allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical
interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means
for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative
working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby
simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided,
highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though
realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual
contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络和简单特征拼接方法在多模态数据融合中效果不佳，导致关键信息丢失，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 采用不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制，融合PET、MRI、遗传数据和临床数据等多模态信息。

Result: 算法模型在测试集上达到94.88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 不对称跨模态交叉注意力机制在多模态数据融合中表现优异，为AD诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease
characterized by progressive cognitive decline as its main symptom. In the
research field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional
convolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to
effectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and
the simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key
information during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the
development of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for
solving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper
proposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical
professionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as
brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the
presence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).
The innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal
cross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information
features of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper
compares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the
traditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning
models for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric
cross-modal cross-attention mechanism. The algorithm model achieves an accuracy
of 94.88% on the test set.

Result: 模型在独立测试集上ROC曲线下面积为0.87，误分类分析显示部分错误源于初始放射学报告的不准确。

Conclusion: 开发的AI模型性能强且透明，可支持临床决策。

Abstract: Introduction: Chest CT scans are increasingly used in dyspneic patients where
acute heart failure (AHF) is a key differential diagnosis. Interpretation
remains challenging and radiology reports are frequently delayed due to a
radiologist shortage, although flagging such information for emergency
physicians would have therapeutic implication. Artificial intelligence (AI) can
be a complementary tool to enhance the diagnostic precision. We aim to develop
an explainable AI model to detect radiological signs of AHF in chest CT with an
accuracy comparable to thoracic radiologists.
  Methods: A single-center, retrospective study during 2016-2021 at Copenhagen
University Hospital - Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg, Denmark. A Boosted Trees
model was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and
pulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for
training and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were
segmented with TotalSegmentator. Shapley Additive explanations values were used
to explain the impact of each measurement on the final prediction.
  Results: Of the 4,672 subjects, 49% were female. The final model incorporated
twelve key features of AHF and achieved an area under the ROC of 0.87 on the
independent test set. Expert radiologist review of model misclassifications
found that 24 out of 64 (38%) false positives and 24 out of 61 (39%) false
negatives were actually correct model predictions, with the errors originating
from inaccuracies in the initial radiology reports.
  Conclusion: We developed an explainable AI model with strong discriminatory
performance, comparable to thoracic radiologists. The AI model's stepwise,
transparent predictions may support decision-making.

Method: 将隐私保护问题建模为对抗攻击问题，提出一种新颖的攻击策略，选择性隐藏图像中的敏感区域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种先进VLMs（LLaVA、Instruct-BLIP、BLIP2-T5）上能减少98%的目标ROI检测，同时保持图像全局语义。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态模型的隐私保护提供了实用工具，并推动了隐私意识的提升。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These
models have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread
adoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious
concerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process
or expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation
of privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack
strategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of
Interests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing
sensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining
image. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire
image, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental
results across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and
BLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while
maintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity
scores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work
contributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a
practical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring
vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring
variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring
plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is
traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it
labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular,
mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra,
which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods
provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification,
segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time
consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to
accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray
images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with
dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared
to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring
reliable vertebral contour extraction.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality,

combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR)
for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former
generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then
processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X
512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global
relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results
demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and
synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for
real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a
diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100
synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy
in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding
to random guessing).

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for phase retrieval that leverages Langevin
dynamics to enable efficient posterior sampling, yielding reconstructions that
explicitly balance distortion and perceptual quality. Unlike conventional
approaches that prioritize pixel-wise accuracy, our method navigates the
perception-distortion tradeoff through a principled combination of stochastic
sampling, learned denoising, and model-based updates. The framework comprises
three variants of increasing complexity, integrating theoretically grounded
Langevin inference, adaptive noise schedule learning, parallel reconstruction
sampling, and warm-start initialization from classical solvers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, both in terms of fidelity and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Phase retrieval involves recovering a signal from intensity-only
measurements, crucial in many fields such as imaging, holography, optical
computing, crystallography, and microscopy. Although there are several
well-known phase retrieval algorithms, including classical iterative solvers,
the reconstruction performance often remains sensitive to initialization and
measurement noise. Recently, image-to-image diffusion models have gained
traction in various image reconstruction tasks, yielding significant
theoretical insights and practical breakthroughs. In this work, we introduce a
novel phase retrieval approach based on an image-to-image diffusion framework
called Inversion by Direct Iteration. Our method begins with an enhanced
initialization stage that leverages a hybrid iterative technique, combining the
Hybrid Input-Output and Error Reduction methods and incorporating a novel
acceleration mechanism to obtain a robust crude estimate. Then, it iteratively
refines this initial crude estimate using the learned image-to-image pipeline.
Our method achieves substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our approach utilizes aggregation
techniques to refine quality metrics and demonstrates superior results compared
to both classical and contemporary techniques. This highlights its potential
for effective and efficient phase retrieval across various applications.

Abstract: Medical Imagings are considered one of the crucial diagnostic tools for
different bones-related diseases, especially bones fractures. This paper
investigates the robustness of pre-trained deep learning models for classifying
bone fractures in X-ray images and seeks to address global healthcare disparity
through the lens of technology. Three deep learning models have been tested
under varying simulated equipment quality conditions. ResNet50, VGG16 and
EfficientNetv2 are the three pre-trained architectures which are compared.
These models were used to perform bone fracture classification as images were
progressively degraded using noise. This paper specifically empirically studies
how the noise can affect the bone fractures detection and how the pre-trained
models performance can be changes due to the noise that affect the quality of
the X-ray images. This paper aims to help replicate real world challenges
experienced by medical imaging technicians across the world. Thus, this paper
establishes a methodological framework for assessing AI model degradation using
transfer learning and controlled noise augmentation. The findings provide
practical insight into how robust and generalizable different pre-trained deep
learning powered computer vision models can be when used in different contexts.

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了框架的有效性，成功重建高分辨率温度数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为全球全天候高分辨率温度数据生成提供了新可能。

Abstract: Central to Earth observation is the trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. For temperature, this is especially critical because real-world
applications require high spatiotemporal resolution data. Current technology
allows for hourly temperature observations at 2 km, but only every 16 days at
100 m, a gap further exacerbated by cloud cover. Earth system models offer
continuous hourly temperature data, but at a much coarser spatial resolution
(9-31 km). Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for
temperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources. The
proposed framework uses a convolutional neural network that incorporates the
annual temperature cycle and includes a linear term to amplify the coarse Earth
system model output into fine-scale temperature values observed from
satellites. We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16
(2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective
temperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.
This physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for
generating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales,
under all weather conditions and globally.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated
with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung
cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical
need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of
832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed
using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to
128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50,
VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based
classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and
Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics
included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC.
U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice:
0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for
non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For

accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid
CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent
F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed
existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones
provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung
cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IM-LUT的新框架，通过混合多个插值函数实现任意尺度超分辨率（ASISR），平衡了效率与图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法仅适用于固定尺度超分辨率，而ASISR方法计算成本高且内存需求大，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出IM-LUT框架，通过IM-Net预测插值函数的混合权重，并利用LUT替换高计算量操作，实现轻量级快速推理。

Result: 实验表明，IM-LUT在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，平衡了图像质量与效率。

Conclusion: IM-LUT是一种适用于资源受限应用的高效ASISR解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has been a pivotal task in image processing, aimed at
enhancing image resolution across various applications. Recently, look-up table
(LUT)-based approaches have attracted interest due to their efficiency and
performance. However, these methods are typically designed for fixed scale
factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary-scale image SR (ASISR). Existing
ASISR techniques often employ implicit neural representations, which come with
considerable computational cost and memory demands. To address these
limitations, we propose Interpolation Mixing LUT (IM-LUT), a novel framework
that operates ASISR by learning to blend multiple interpolation functions to
maximize their representational capacity. Specifically, we introduce IM-Net, a
network trained to predict mixing weights for interpolation functions based on
local image patterns and the target scale factor. To enhance efficiency of
interpolation-based methods, IM-Net is transformed into IM-LUT, where LUTs are
employed to replace computationally expensive operations, enabling lightweight
and fast inference on CPUs while preserving reconstruction quality.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IM-LUT
consistently achieves a superior balance between image quality and efficiency
compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential as a promising
solution for resource-constrained applications.

Conclusion: 多级融合架构有效整合语义信息，显著提升了脑肿瘤分割性能。

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances
in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to
tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial
relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted
from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical
reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that
integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information,
facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level
concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding
capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the
spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms:
3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based
attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of
0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with
a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor
(ET) region.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet the variability in imaging quality across different MRI
scanners presents significant challenges to model generalization. To address
this, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System
(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to
adaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby
enhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to
this system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for
Brain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive
Encoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a
Graph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model
complementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we
introduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that
synergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed
convolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,
improving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves
a Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million
parameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer
models, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches. This
work demonstrates a synergistic breakthrough in achieving high-accuracy,
resource-efficient brain tumor segmentation suitable for deployment in
resource-constrained clinical environments.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of multiple LiDARs is crucial for improving
the foundational performance of three-dimensional (3D) map reconstruction
systems. This paper presents a novel targetless extrinsic calibration framework
for multi-LiDAR systems that does not rely on overlapping fields of view or
precise initial parameter estimates. Unlike conventional calibration methods
that require manual annotations or specific reference patterns, our approach
introduces a unified optimization framework by integrating LiDAR bundle
adjustment (LBA) optimization with robust iterative refinement. The proposed
method constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning
from the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while
formulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This
method effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves
outlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.
Extensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world
scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration
techniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for
non-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average
translational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\deg}, with an
initial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\deg}. Moreover, the calibration
process operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses
significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to
occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR
fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs).
Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the
systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes
precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from
roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections
annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings,
and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of
cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed
fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific
feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera
high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative
evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach
consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal
baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the
mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the
image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study
establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and
provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted
autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few
learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While
Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have
not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world
implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a
compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path
integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during
learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the
right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We
validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation
showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled
learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks
using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal
behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to
control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and
functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite
relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with
32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a
biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual
homing.

Conclusion: GUIDER的双阶段框架有效提升了移动操作任务中的意图推断能力。

Abstract: Accurate inference of human intent enables human-robot collaboration without
constraining human control or causing conflicts between humans and robots. We
present GUIDER (Global User Intent Dual-phase Estimation for Robots), a
probabilistic framework that enables a robot to estimate the intent of human
operators. GUIDER maintains two coupled belief layers, one tracking navigation
goals and the other manipulation goals. In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map
blends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.
Upon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.
The Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and
three geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware
update rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can
recognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated
GUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and
compared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.
Across the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during
navigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of
39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5). During manipulation, stability reached
94-100% (versus 69-100% for Trajectron), with a 31.4% difference in a
redirection task (T3). In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER
recognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median
remaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate
our dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both
phases of mobile manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: SC-ADAS是一个结合生成式AI的模块化框架，通过多轮对话和场景感知提供实时、可解释的自适应驾驶辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ADAS系统缺乏场景理解和自然语言交互能力，SC-ADAS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 集成大型语言模型、视觉到文本解释和结构化功能调用，支持基于视觉和传感器上下文的多轮对话。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中实现，展示了场景感知、对话和多轮交互的可行性，但存在延迟和令牌增长等权衡。

Conclusion: SC-ADAS证明了结合对话推理、场景感知和模块化ADAS控制的可行性，为下一代智能驾驶辅助提供了方向。

Abstract: While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级深度学习框架，用于XL-MIMO系统中的高效级联信道估计，旨在降低计算复杂度并适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G等下一代无线技术需要满足超高数据速率、低延迟和增强连接性的要求，XL-MIMO和RIS是关键推动技术，但实现其潜力依赖于准确的CSI。现有估计模型在XL-MIMO系统中的可扩展性和实际部署受限。

Method: 提出了一种基于空间相关性的轻量级深度学习框架，采用基于分块的训练机制，降低输入维度并保留关键信息，实现大规模系统的可扩展训练。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架显著提高了估计精度并降低了计算复杂度，适用于XL-MIMO系统中天线和RIS元件数量的增加。

Conclusion: 该框架为XL-MIMO系统中的高效级联信道估计提供了一种可行的解决方案，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding
requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced
connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and
energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control
over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However,
realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information
(CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded
channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of
existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing
number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to
real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume,
escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting
in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation
in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial
correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that
reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while
preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale
systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational
complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in
XL-MIMO systems.

Conclusion: 能量分析框架为理解和改进扩散模型行为提供了有力工具，自适应CFG调度显著提升了图像质量和稳定性。

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from
energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We
analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive
classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy
trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that
modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores
(0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance
approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling
yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while
reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful
diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD建模通常耗时且依赖人工，现有方法未能充分利用LLMs的潜力。本文旨在探索LLMs在CAD设计中的应用。

Method: 构建了一个包含17万多个CAD模型的数据集，使用GPT-4.1生成高质量描述，并微调代码-LLMs以从自然语言生成JSON格式的CAD序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效自动化CAD设计，显著加快新对象的设计速度。

Conclusion: 通过LLMs和新的评估指标，论文展示了文本条件CAD生成的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects,
and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications
like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains
largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate
this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence
representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the
potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this
work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models
annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our
pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs
to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural
language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this
approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail
to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and
topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler
characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and
ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that
CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of
new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

Conclusion: 通过局部表情和高斯抛光的结合，该方法显著提升了3D头部头像的逼真度和动态表现力。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.

Result: 该框架支持选择理论中的弃权、机器学习中的非凸目标，并免费扩展了DPO的某些设置（如边界和长度校正）。

Conclusion: DPO的理论框架不仅覆盖了现有变体，还揭示了偏离该框架的潜在问题及解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA是一种广泛用于微调大语言模型的技术，通过引入少量可训练的低秩权重矩阵，显著减少参数更新量，提升内存和计算效率。然而，其速度提升在不同模型架构和训练设置中不一致。本文分析了LoRA性能，提出更高效的微调方法，并验证其优于或与LoRA相当的性能和更一致的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在不同模型和训练设置中速度提升不一致，需要深入分析其性能限制因素。

Method: 全面分析LoRA性能，提出更高效的微调方法，并进行实证评估。

Result: 提出的方法在性能上与LoRA相当或更优，且提供更一致的训练速度提升。

Conclusion: 为资源受限下优化LLM微调提供了实用指导和见解。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of
trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of
parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory
consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However,
we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across
all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the
underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose
several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate
these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach
achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent
training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical
guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource
constraints.

Conclusion: LoRA-MCL有效解决了语言模型的多解问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in
language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence
continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an
intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be
equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and
the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying
Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated
from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use
data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive
experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method
achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

Result: 在无污染数据集上，仅准确奖励信号能提升性能，而噪声或错误信号无效。

Conclusion: 建议在无污染基准和多样化模型上评估RL方法，以确保结论的可信度。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

Motivation: 现有零样本NAS方法的有效性、稳定性和通用性不足，需要更高效的训练免费代理来加速架构评估。

Result: WRCor及其投票代理在代理评估中表现优于现有方法，并在架构搜索中超越大多数现有NAS算法。

Conclusion: WRCor是一种高效且通用的训练免费代理，能够显著提升NAS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256基准测试中，训练速度比SiT-XL快23.3倍，比REPA快4倍。

Conclusion: 表示引导显著提升了扩散模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

Method: 引入R-MDN层，通过递归最小二乘法动态调整特征表示，适应数据和混杂变量的变化分布。

Result: 实验表明，R-MDN在静态学习和持续学习中均能减少混杂变量的影响，提升预测公平性。

Conclusion: R-MDN是一种有效的工具，可用于任何深度学习架构，以消除混杂变量的影响并减少灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“warm-start model”的确定性模型，通过提供更好的起始点来加速条件生成，显著减少了生成过程所需的步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的迭代生成模型（如扩散模型和流匹配）需要数百次函数评估，生成速度慢。本文旨在通过改进起始点来加速生成过程。

Method: 引入warm-start模型，预测一个基于输入上下文的有信息先验N(mu, sigma)，而非传统的无信息先验N(0, I)。结合条件归一化技巧，使其兼容标准生成模型。

Result: 在图像修复等任务中，仅需11次函数评估（1次用于warm start，10次用于生成）即可达到与1000步DDPM基线竞争的结果。

Conclusion: warm-start模型显著提高了生成效率，且无需修改现有生成模型和采样器，可与其他高效采样技术结合使用。

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: MLoRQ是一种高效且兼容性强的压缩方法，适用于边缘设备上的Transformer部署。

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

Result: 模型实现了边界到稳态的直接映射，通用性强，SSIM > 0.8，边界精度高。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从AI加速物理到AI发现物理的范式转变，建立了首个通用物理模拟框架。

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical
constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics
to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics
simulation framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保护用户隐私的同时学习具有高预测能力的表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡预测能力和隐私保护方面具有潜力。

Abstract: How can we learn a representation with high predictive power while preserving
user privacy? We present an adversarial representation learning method for
sanitizing sensitive content from the learned representation. Specifically, we
introduce a variant of entropy - focal entropy, which mitigates the potential
information leakage of the existing entropy-based approaches. We showcase
feasibility on multiple benchmarks. The results suggest high target utility at
moderate privacy leakage.

*Giacomo Cignoni,Andrea Cossu,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Joost van de Weijer,Antonio Carta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CLA的自监督学习策略，用于在线持续学习场景，通过对齐当前与过去的表征来减少遗忘，并加速训练收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线持续学习（Online CL）中，数据以小块形式到达，模型需在固定计算预算下运行且无任务边界，现有自监督学习（SSL）技术较少。

Method: 提出Continual Latent Alignment（CLA），通过对齐当前模型与过去学习的表征来减少遗忘。

Result: CLA在在线场景中加速训练收敛，并在相同计算预算下优于现有方法；作为预训练协议时，其早期表现优于全独立同分布预训练。

Conclusion: CLA是一种有效的在线持续学习自监督策略，能提升模型性能并减少遗忘。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

### [283] [AInsight: Augmenting Expert Decision-Making with On-the-Fly Insights Grounded in Historical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09100)
*Mohammad Abolnejadian,Shakiba Amirshahi,Matthew Brehmer,Anamaria Crisan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在实时决策对话中利用历史数据，通过构建基于检索的大型语言模型（LLM）系统，为专家提供实时洞察。以医患对话为例，系统能识别问题与解决方案，并从数据中生成相关见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专家在实时对话中需快速决策，但无法有效利用历史数据。研究旨在探索如何通过技术手段实现实时数据支持。

Method: 开发了一个基于LLM的对话界面系统，实时监听对话，识别问题与解决方案，并从嵌入的数据集中检索相关信息生成见解。

Result: 通过模拟医患对话测试，系统显示出有效性，但也面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究证明了实时数据支持在决策对话中的潜力，为后续工作指明了方向。

Abstract: In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and
make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive
historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it
infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information.
This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant
past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data?
To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking
doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously
listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested
solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating
concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language
Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada
datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample
doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting
directions for the next steps of our work.

### [284] [Less Stress, More Privacy: Stress Detection on Anonymized Speech of Air Traffic Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08882)
*Janaki Viswanathan,Alexander Blatt,Konrad Hagemann,Dietrich Klakow*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文研究了匿名化语音数据在空管压力检测中的应用，展示了隐私保护与高性能深度学习模型可以共存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空管工作压力大且容错率低，压力检测对安全至关重要，但语音数据处理涉及隐私限制。

Method: 评估了不同架构在匿名化语音数据上的压力检测性能。

Result: 最佳模型在匿名化SUSAS数据集上达到93.6%准确率，在匿名化空管模拟数据集上达到80.1%准确率。

Conclusion: 隐私保护不会阻碍高性能深度学习模型的构建。

Abstract: Air traffic control (ATC) demands multi-tasking under time pressure with high
consequences of an error. This can induce stress. Detecting stress is a key
point in maintaining the high safety standards of ATC. However, processing ATC
voice data entails privacy restrictions, e.g. the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) law. Anonymizing the ATC voice data is one way to comply with
these restrictions. In this paper, different architectures for stress detection
for anonymized ATCO speech are evaluated. Our best networks reach a stress
detection accuracy of 93.6% on an anonymized version of the Speech Under
Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) dataset and an accuracy of 80.1% on our
anonymized ATC simulation dataset. This shows that privacy does not have to be
an impediment in building well-performing deep-learning-based models.

### [285] [Voice Conversion for Lombard Speaking Style with Implicit and Explicit Acoustic Feature Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09310)
*Dominika Woszczyk,Manuel Sam Ribeiro,Thomas Merritt,Daniel Korzekwa*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过语音转换（VC）技术实现Lombard说话风格的迁移，比较了隐式和显式声学特征条件的方法，发现隐式条件方法在保持说话人相似性的同时，达到了与显式条件方法相当的清晰度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lombard说话风格的TTS系统能提升语音清晰度，但数据收集困难。语音转换技术可作为数据不足时的替代方案。

Method: 比较了隐式和显式声学特征条件的语音转换模型。

Result: 隐式条件方法在清晰度提升和说话人相似性保持方面表现与显式条件方法相当。

Conclusion: 隐式条件方法是一种有效的Lombard风格迁移策略。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems in Lombard speaking style can improve the
overall intelligibility of speech, useful for hearing loss and noisy
conditions. However, training those models requires a large amount of data and
the Lombard effect is challenging to record due to speaker and noise
variability and tiring recording conditions. Voice conversion (VC) has been
shown to be a useful augmentation technique to train TTS systems in the absence
of recorded data from the target speaker in the target speaking style. In this
paper, we are concerned with Lombard speaking style transfer. Our goal is to
convert speaker identity while preserving the acoustic attributes that define
the Lombard speaking style. We compare voice conversion models with implicit
and explicit acoustic feature conditioning. We observe that our proposed
implicit conditioning strategy achieves an intelligibility gain comparable to
the model conditioned on explicit acoustic features, while also preserving
speaker similarity.
