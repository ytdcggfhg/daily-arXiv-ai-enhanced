What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784(MSA)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u8c03\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u60f3\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784(MSA)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u5728\"\u6a21\u578b\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\"\u4f53\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMSA\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u8fd8\u662f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d", "conclusion": "MSA\u80fd\u591f\u955c\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84"}}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff08\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u53e5\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u53e5\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522bLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "LMs\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLMs\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL.

Preprint", "summary": "Crop mapping involves identifying and classifying crop types using spatial\ndata, primarily derived from remote sensing imagery. This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions. We advocate that HOI-specific\ncues must be anticipated at the encoder stage itself to obtain a stronger scene\ninterpretation. Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding.

In this study, an innovative imaging omics\nframework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived\nthrough deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to\nhighlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the\nconventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease.

While\nneural parametric models are actively studied for humans and animals, plant\nleaves present unique challenges due to their diverse shapes and flexible\ndeformation. To this problem, we introduce a neural parametric model for\nleaves, NeuraLeaf. Capitalizing on the fact that flattened leaf shapes can be\napproximated as a 2D plane, NeuraLeaf disentangles the leaves' geometry into\ntheir 2D base shapes and 3D deformations. This representation allows learning\nfrom rich sources of 2D leaf image datasets for the base shapes, and also has\nthe advantage of simultaneously learning textures aligned with the geometry.

We present a system for\nautomatically assessing oral narratives of preschool children in Afrikaans and\nisiXhosa. The system uses automatic speech recognition followed by a machine\nlearning scoring model to predict narrative and comprehension scores. For\nscoring predicted transcripts, we compare a linear model to a large language\nmodel (LLM). The LLM-based system outperforms the linear model in most cases,\nbut the linear system is competitive despite its simplicity.

However, the heavy\nreliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and\nincurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective\nlearning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution\nmismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics\nmodel equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder\n(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

Fortunately,\nfoundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong\npotential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which\npromotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in\nlong-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual\nencoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,\noverlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we\npropose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for\nlong-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance\nderived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.\nSpecifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as\nsemantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The\nintroduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the\nmodel to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the\nalignment between the visual and textual modalities.

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot\nmethods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable\nlimitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality\nindependently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal\ninteraction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,\nwithout fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference\nimage. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with\nre-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework.

Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations.

Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

However, domain shifts often undermine model\nreliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and\nsafety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating\ntarget domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance\nwithout ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient\nrobustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While\nprevious work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,\nthese methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper\nfirst adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image\nclassification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the\nlimitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane\nfeatures, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework\n(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image\nencoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane\ndetection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the\nOpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),\ndemonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE\nof 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727.

We also propose two new Federated Learning algorithms,\nnamely Fed-Cyclic and Fed-Star. In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from\nits previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to\nthe next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives\nweights from all other clients, updates its local weights through\npre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and\nsends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like\ntopology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than\nexisting baselines on our newly introduced dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Fed-Cyclic\u548cFed-Star\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1aFed-Cyclic\uff08\u5faa\u73af\u62d3\u6251\uff09\u548cFed-Star\uff08\u661f\u578b\u62d3\u6251\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b23,326\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,\nleading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths\nsuch as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image\ngeneration quality and model stability.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u578b\uff08MUPM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMUPM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc3\u810fMR\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "MUPM\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "MUPM\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the\ndistribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the\ncorresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting\ntasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RGB\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08RGB-LDM\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff08SR\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5305\u542bRGB\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u672a\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SpeUAE\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5149\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528RGB-LDM\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81LDM\uff08ULDM\uff09\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SR\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5229\u7528RGB\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SR\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces.

The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

We make use of\nBRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,\nboth of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.\n  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality\nchecker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.\nThe multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only\nimages by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.\n  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image\nconditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,\ngeneralizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model\ncontributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times\ncomputationally efficient compared to having five individual models\ncorresponding to each disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "InSight\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u60a3\u8005\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u4e94\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u773c\u75c5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b5b\u67e5\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u773c\u75c5\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u533b\u7597\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5b9e\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u548cDR\u5206\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "InSight\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u591a\u6837\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u662f\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e94\u500d\u3002"}}

The WaveletInception feature extractor\nutilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting\nvibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early\nnetwork layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer.

This\npaper presents the authors' endeavor to develop, deploy and evaluate a\ndual-LiDAR system at an intersection in the city of Rialto, California, for TMC\nestimation. The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to\nclassify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and\nvehicle classes.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local\nSynthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but\nsuffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D\nimage generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D\ninpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule\nand the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for\nhigh-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial\ntraining. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet\ndiffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting\nmodel, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a\nPSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these\nscores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81\ns per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue\ninpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior\nperformance metrics.
