The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation."}

During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches."}

However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions."}

New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1) allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and future modeling improvements."}

Given an image and a question such as \"How many dogs are in the scene?\" or \"Where is the buffalo?\", the system grounds visual detections into symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to count, presence, and location.

Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models."}

While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated self-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to synergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the iterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that MonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular benchmark. Highlighting its broad applicability, MonoVQD's core components seamlessly integrate into other architectures, delivering significant performance gains even in multi-view 3D detection scenarios on the nuScenes dataset and underscoring its robust generalization capabilities."}

Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters."}

While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement, enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o."}

However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)."}

In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally similar problems compared to training solely on natural language representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models."}

This paper proposes the Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems, offering a new perspective on CNN optimization."}

Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results."}

However, conventional annotation methods heavily rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks, proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring."}

Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque. Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque, which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g., Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly available."}

Under review for NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training."}

We evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image benchmarks.

Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods."}

While many studies on LID model training focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LID models."}

Traditional compliance detection methods are limited by their lack of portability and scalability, rely on specialized, often expensive equipment, and are unsuitable for robotic applications. Moreover, existing neural network-based approaches using vision-based tactile sensors still suffer from insufficient prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose two models based on Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs) and Transformer architectures that leverage RGB tactile images and other information captured by the vision-based sensor GelSight to predict compliance metrics accurately. We validate the performance of these models using multiple metrics and demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately estimating compliance. The proposed models exhibit significant performance improvement over the baseline. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between sensor compliance and object compliance estimation, which revealed that objects that are harder than the sensor are more challenging to estimate."}

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably, demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems."}

However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content.

Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images.

Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs."}

To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets. Then, these selected points are leveraged as high-quality prompts for SAM to get the segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynPo achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art training-based few-shot methods."}

While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and classification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of the method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with less parameter cost.

Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches. We further design a task-specific metric that jointly scores retrieval recall and localization precision.

To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context."}

In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process. The proposed scheme is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing Learned Image Compression (LIC) models. Extensive experiments across multiple downstream tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design."}

However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection."}

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet."}

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers, citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs."}

We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches."}

Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories. On both datasets, RA-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both camera pose estimation and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in scene reconstruction under complex pose trajectories."}

However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused."}

In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes. Extensive experiments on several widely used datasets demonstrate that our RetroMem significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain.

We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design."}

In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io."}

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks. To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases. Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons."}

Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two."}

Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about 75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities."}

Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles. Our framework does not require ground truth UV annotations and can be trained in a self-supervised manner. Experiments on seal and leopard datasets show up to a 5.4% improvement in re-identification accuracy."}

We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning. Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks (including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning consistency in LLMs."}

Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset. Experiments on PACS and Ima geNet demonstrate that DDIS outperforms prior DFIS methods by generating samples that better reflect the training data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in data-free applications."}

Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs."}

The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection methods."}

To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.

Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WinWinLay excels in controlling element placement and achieving photorealistic visual fidelity, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods."}

This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during crises, protests, and information shocks."}

We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures."}

We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains.

Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research."}

We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step.

To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $μP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $μ$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $μ$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \\emph{interpolate between the $μ$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $μ$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $Θ(\\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $Θ(width)$ ratio predicted by $μ$P. We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the embedding LR."}

To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters."}

Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling. Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs to pursue similar objectives."}

HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality.

This paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio, captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions."}

However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for improvement."}

We propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video descriptions, which are optimised using DPO.

Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer."}

We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices.

In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness.

Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."}

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be dismissed as training noise."}

However, the limited spatial resolution in 360° videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360° video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360° video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360° Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360° videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360° Video Super-Resolution (360° VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360°~specific super-resolution models on 360° video datasets. A step-wise ablation study is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation."}

Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices.

The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance.

In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical knowledge.

Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2.

The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved.

We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.\n  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using relatively small clinical datasets."}

We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries.

Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%, depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not necessarily increase the effectiveness.

Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger.

However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones.

To solve this task, we simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.

Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference.

The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference.

In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD."}

Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test dataset."}

However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity."}

Early detection is critical for effective treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality. This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset. Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD) filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision, 13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer classification performance using CNN architectures."}

However, these explanations are highly non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each pixel's importance against $\\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5 ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust, interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks.

Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment."}

We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence.

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views.

Although state-of-the-art generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in 3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards. Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking, Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting within a few finetuning steps."}
