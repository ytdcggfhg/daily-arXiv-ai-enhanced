Empirical results demonstrate that applying the\nproposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall\nresponse diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response\nquality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff08MRG\u548cPS\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee3\u7406\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff08MRG\uff09\u548c\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\uff08PS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165o2mDial\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u9ad890%\uff09\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This task requires\nMLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding\nnot only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual\nelements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart.

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods.

By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific\nmid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to\nreconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our\nfrequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image\ndifficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined\nby comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image\ndatasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u6821\u51c6\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff08FCRE\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIA\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709MIA\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6210\u5458\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFCRE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709MIA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FCRE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with\nSynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map\ncollection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.\nThe project is released at\nhttps://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.", "AI": {"tldr": "PALETTE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5c40\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u503e\u659c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5730\u7406\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u6837\u5f0f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPALETTE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8d85\u5c40\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u6587\u672c\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9\u548c\u5b57\u7b26\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636eSynthMap+\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "PALETTE\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u4e866\u4e07\u5f20\u5730\u56fe\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4e861\u4ebf\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "conclusion": "PALETTE\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that\nuses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of\nthe style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove\nstyle-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.\nThis gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free\ninjection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy\nbased on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in\nthe fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive\nlearning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a\ntraining-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which\nmanipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the\ncross-attention mechanism.

PDSA distinguishes\nthe point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor,\nand enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor\nfeature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance\nmodeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the\ncomputational overhead. The experimental result on semantic segmentation and\nclassification tasks based on different baselines verify the generalization of\nthe method we proposed, and achieve significant performance improvement with\nless parameter cost. The corresponding ablation and visualization results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our method.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density.

Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency.

Our study highlights the importance of\nimproving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future\nadvancements in gender fairness in generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6570\uff08GIFI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u65f6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGIFI\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u8bcd\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\uff09\u91cf\u5316LLMs\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf922\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u6807\u8bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Current approaches typically\nmerge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing\nphenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and\ndegraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new\ntask, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our\ndataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised\nmulti-sentence caption-graph pairs for images.

These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic\nvariation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in\ninterpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u82f1\u7f8e\u82f1\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5bf9\u201cquite\u201d\u548c\u201cvery\u201d\u7b49\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bcd\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u8bdd\u8bed\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u8bef\u89e3\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u8fd8\u662f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bed\u7528\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u793c\u8c8c\u548c\u7b80\u6d01\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u7f8e\u82f1\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5bf9\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bcd\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3001\u793c\u8c8c\u548c\u8bdd\u8bed\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u8bdd\u8bed\u6210\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u793c\u8c8c\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u56e0\u7d20\u590d\u6742\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Training high-performance models for this\ntask typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution\nby iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby\nreducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the\nassumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to\ntarget classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often\ncontains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low\nefficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing\nAL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a\nsignificant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for\npathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language\nModel (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine\ntarget and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select\nIn-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In\nsubsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes\nPrototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic\nSampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a\nquery, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public\npathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's\nperformance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

To enhance the quality of generated 4D\nHOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to\nextract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention\nto effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.\nExperimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the\npublicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI\ngeneration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenHOI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b34D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HOI\uff09\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f4D HOI\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a214D HOI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76844D HOI\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Object-AnchorNet\u4ece3D HOI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f3D HOI\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7Contact-Aware Diffusion Model\uff08ContactDM\uff09\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c64D HOI\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Contact-Aware Encoder\u548cHOI Attention\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728OMOMO\u548c3D-FUTURE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f4D HOI\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GenHOI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864D HOI\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics\nframework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid\nrepresentation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views.
