ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess\nToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a\nnovel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in\nreaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present\nTomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting\nand responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of\nTomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,\nfew-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,\nchain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and\ninformation about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized\nboth variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,\nGPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,\nwe conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided\nparticipants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed\nintent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM\ncapabilities of Tomcat and our study participants.

The\ncompositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional\ngeneralisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training\ndistribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data\ndistribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the\nmodel works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the\nprocesses through which these components are combined. We present these notions\nin a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a\nseries of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.\n  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of\nmodels can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit\nbased models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from\none of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of\ncompositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the\nproductivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the\nsystematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation\ntasks.

However, LLMs\noften fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated\nresponses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we\nintroduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to\nwhich retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We\nsystematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual\nconsistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as\nRAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across\nmost LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context\nfidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context\nAligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to\noptimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.\nRadiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to\nintegrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a\nbehavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied\nretrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and\nhallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and\nfactually coherent content generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRadiant\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Entity-Context Divergence\uff08ECD\uff09\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faRadiant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Direct Preference Optimization\uff08DPO\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684RAG\u80fd\u529b\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u800cRadiant\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Radiant\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree.

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the\nsafety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to\nuncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent.

Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to\nLLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit\nfrom structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them\nparticularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal\nmathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision\nlanguage pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,\nhighlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient\nsolution for next generation multimodal transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCSAT\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08vLLMs\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728vLLMs\u4e2d\u56e0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "CSAT\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6d4b\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u952e\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u7b97\u6cd5\u91cd\u5efa\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "CSAT\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CSAT\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u591a\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our\nmethodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite\nimagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model\nsuccessfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly\n90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop\ncensus 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach\nincorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop\nsowing and harvest periods.

Two recent\ntechnological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that\ncombines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of\nquantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log\ndata,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but\nthat can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second\nis the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern\nrecognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step\ntoward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to\ntransform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's\nlife trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%).

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency.

Existing research commonly attributes\nhallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter\nmeans the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user\nexpectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents.

However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still\nrely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation\ncosts, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level\ntendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that\nleverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on\nGoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback\ninto continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals\nthrough lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random\ntrace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter\nPreference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,\nenabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly\non these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels.

The effect of regional consistency on\nclassification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data\nare two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects.

This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs\nwith a similar capacity for internal processing.\n  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'\nOur findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing\nthe model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins\npredicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant\nperformance improvements.

Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning\nstrategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they\npredominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous\nmulti-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key\nchallenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling\nmodels trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target\ndistributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences\nbetween modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG\ntypically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness\nduring generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to\nconsider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each\nmodality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent\ngeneralization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded\ngeneralization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\napproach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired\nmodalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling\nsynchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space.

Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated\nvisuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with\nimages rated as moderately distinctive.

Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this\ntask, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal\ndynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a\nnovel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and\nSubnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC\ndynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and\nuniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on\ncontextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse\nsigning behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that\nexisting methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter\nupdates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant\npath. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to\nsubnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and\neffectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC\nfurther strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no\ninference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models\nto boost performance.

However, existing methods\noften suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and\ninsufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that\nhinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and\nefficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built\nupon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation\ncapability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This\nmodule improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual\nstructure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture\nfine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational\npower of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy\ncaused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive\nScreening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and\naggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level\nsemantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant\ncomputations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection\naccuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,\nparticularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality\ndataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources.

Previous work has mainly\nrelied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and\nunobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal\nrelationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked\nTemporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space\ntemporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages\na learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,\nthereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By\nintegrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end\ntraining tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,\nwe introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action\ngeneration space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to\nprioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end\nstates over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out\ntask-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action\nsequences.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach for learning normals from noisy point clouds through\nlocal gradient-aware surface filtering. Our method projects noisy points onto\nthe underlying surface by utilizing normals and distances derived from an\nimplicit function constrained by local gradients. We start by introducing a\ndistance measurement operator for global surface fitting on noisy data, which\nintegrates projected distances along normals. Following this, we develop an\nimplicit field-based filtering approach for surface point construction, adding\nprojection constraints on these points during filtering. To address issues of\nover-smoothing and gradient degradation, we further incorporate local gradient\nconsistency constraints, as well as local gradient orientation and aggregation.\nComprehensive experiments on normal estimation, surface reconstruction, and\npoint cloud denoising demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our\nmethod.

To remedy this problem,\nwe attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various\nattacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low\nentropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on\nthe universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is\nelaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.\n2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower\nentropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark\ncontrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct\nexisting test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:\nRectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial\nrectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with\nclean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified\nwith low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating\ntheir adversarial nature.

The\ninterpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but\ntypically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in\norder to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are\nalready installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they\ndirectly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate\ninstantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point\nclouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance\nscene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify\nmoving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform\nsingle-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The\nkey to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity\ninformation throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise\nsegmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a\ntransformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively\ncombining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse\npoint clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation\nbenchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%.

Submitted for peer review", "summary": "Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term\ndisability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction\ntechniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most\neffective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke\nclassification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,\nallowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the\noriginal CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional\ndiagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for\nimproving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,\nthis study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically\nconcerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan\nimages. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke\ndetection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing\nclassification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced\noptimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,\nInceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature\nextraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including\nBFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further.

We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution.

We inspect four classes of prompting\nstrategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and\nevaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types.

Across different language\nmodels fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone\naccounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning\nyields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and\nnarrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional\nexperiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance\nin 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical\nreasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and\nLoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware\nevaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned\nvisible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nstate-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u4e49-\u89c6\u89c9\u878d\u5408\uff08HSVF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u96fe\u973e\u53bb\u9664\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u53bb\u96fe\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u96fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u96fe\u973e\u53bb\u9664\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u96fe\u973e\u6b8b\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHSVF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8868\u793a\u91cd\u5efa\u65e0\u96fe\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u4ece\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6a21\u6001\u6062\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHSVF\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u53bb\u96fe\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HSVF\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u534f\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u96fe\u973e\u53bb\u9664\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on\nmodeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,\nneglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every\nsensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and\nnon-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity\nclassification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling\nstrategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain\nperturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive\nexperiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our\ncausality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related\nstate-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and\ncross-position settings.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often\nstruggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to\nconsider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art\nmethods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative\nsolutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color\ndistortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework\n(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting\nconditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an\nilluminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a\nspecialized rendering task.

By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of\nillumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more\neffective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling.\nTo implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a\nlow-rank denoising module.

Unsupervised and semi-supervised\nlearning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform\ndue to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we\nexplore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance\nthe diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our\npreliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises\nefficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data\nfrom world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning\nframework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry\nConsistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance\ncapability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from\nthe alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and\nthe mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel\nPrediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,\nwhere the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of\nmultinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts\nsemantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to\nrealize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic\nExclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity\ninherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest\nimprovements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV\nsegmentation tasks, respectively.

While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,\nit is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.\nIn contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and\ncompositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,\nfine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying\nstate-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat\nimagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad\nhabitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and\nsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification\nmetrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene\nunderstanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive\nlearning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar\nhabitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more\ndiscriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with\nexperienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,\nunderscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment.

To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT\nframework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently\ncompresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token\npruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the\ncross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand\nthe student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through\nparameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through\nextensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only\n1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.\nThis ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple\nscenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements\nin real-world applications.

While existing methods often rely on centralized\nfine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time\nadaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This\nlimitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized\nuser-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the\ngeneration quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we\npresent CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time\npersonalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in\nleveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic\noutputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.\nSpecifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning\nproblem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits\nwithin the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by\ntransmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate\nvectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without\nfine-tuning.

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

Traditional\nmethods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired\nimage-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual\nattributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these\nlimitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy. The\nfirst stage, Multi-Granularity Visual-Language Grounding, enables the Large\nVision-Language Model (LVLM) backbone to autonomously generate and align\nhierarchical captions (global and local) to images, cultivating a deep internal\nsemantic understanding without reliance on extensive human annotation. The\nsecond stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this\nacquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where\nthe LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image\ngeneration process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for\nprecise output alignment.

Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need\nto be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn\nsuch consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions\nare bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To\naddress this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic\nscene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D\noutpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D\npixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input\nwith the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the\nray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to\na dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths.

Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained\ndiffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,\nthese methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising\nprocess.

This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing.

POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using\nReinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly\nenhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%\nto 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,\nscaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation\nand performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.\nThe impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties\nsuggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong\nreward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "POLAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u5224\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7b56\u7565\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7edd\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7b56\u7565\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cPOLAR\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPOLAR\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "POLAR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728STEM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece54.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f381.0%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "POLAR\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u524d\u9014\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Hu and Y. Wang contribute equally", "summary": "Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on\nevaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another\ncritical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and\nretrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of\nbenchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents.

To address this challenge, we\npropose Sat2City, a novel framework that synergizes the representational\ncapacity of sparse voxel grids with latent diffusion models, tailored\nspecifically for our novel 3D city dataset. Our approach is enabled by three\nkey components: (1) A cascaded latent diffusion framework that progressively\nrecovers 3D city structures from satellite imagery, (2) a Re-Hash operation at\nits Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck to compute multi-scale feature\ngrids for stable appearance optimization and (3) an inverse sampling strategy\nenabling implicit supervision for smooth appearance transitioning.To overcome\nthe challenge of collecting real-world city-scale 3D models with high-quality\ngeometry and appearance, we introduce a dataset of synthesized large-scale 3D\ncities paired with satellite-view height maps.

As a result, the depth estimations can\nbe erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this\npaper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed\ndepth value estimations to regularize NeRF training.

By sampling from the\nview-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the\ntraining of NeRF.

However, existing methods are limited to\nchallenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information\nand lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,\nspatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose\nDreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge\nforecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a\nperception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,\nDreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,\nintegrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet\ncomprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how\nhumans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning\nchains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features.

The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it.

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels.

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In\nfact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1\nopen-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\\% of intermittent job\nfailures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using\nfew-shot learning (FSL).

To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a\nnovel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,\nscene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and\nMoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes.

Existing methods primarily aim to improve identification\nperformance, but often overlook the uncertainty arising from inherent defects,\nsuch as intra-modal noise and inter-modal conflicts. This uncertainty is\nparticularly significant in the case of fine-grained local occlusion and frame\nloss, which becomes a challenge in multi-modal learning. To address the above\nchallenge, we propose a robust approach named Uncertainty-Guided Graph model\nfor multi-modal object ReID (UGG-ReID). UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise\ninterference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both\nlocal and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their\ndependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph\nrepresentation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local\ncues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the\nexpressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated\nembeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an\nuncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples\nto experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses\nnoise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design\nan uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,\nimproving the performance.

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling.

So far, the labor-intensive\nprocess of collecting clinical data, particularly in acquiring paired 3D\northodontic teeth models, constitutes a crucial bottleneck for developing tooth\narrangement neural networks. Although numerous general 3D shape generation\nmethods have been proposed, most of them focus on single-object generation and\nare insufficient for generating anatomically structured teeth models, each\ncomprising 24-32 segmented teeth. In this paper, we propose TeethGenerator, a\nnovel two-stage framework designed to synthesize paired 3D teeth models pre-\nand post-orthodontic, aiming to facilitate the training of downstream tooth\narrangement networks. Specifically, our approach consists of two key modules:\n(1) a teeth shape generation module that leverages a diffusion model to learn\nthe distribution of morphological characteristics of teeth, enabling the\ngeneration of diverse post-orthodontic teeth models; and (2) a teeth style\ngeneration module that synthesizes corresponding pre-orthodontic teeth models\nby incorporating desired styles as conditional inputs. Extensive qualitative\nand quantitative experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset aligns\nclosely with the distribution of real orthodontic data, and promotes tooth\nalignment performance significantly when combined with real data for training.\nThe code and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/lcshhh/teeth_generator.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeethGenerator\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6210\u5bf9\u76843D\u7259\u9f7f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7259\u9f7f\u6392\u5217\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6210\u5bf93D\u7259\u9f7f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7259\u9f7f\u6392\u5217\u7f51\u7edc\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7259\u9f7f\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7259\u9f7f\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2\uff09\u7259\u9f7f\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6b63\u7578\u524d\u7259\u9f7f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7259\u9f7f\u6392\u5217\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TeethGenerator\u4e3a\u7259\u9f7f\u6392\u5217\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input\nsemantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual\nconsistency.

In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune\nchannels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive\nframework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected\nlayers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in\neach iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined\nnumber of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods\nand estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in\nthe validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy\ndrops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a\nset of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these\nlayers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these\nselected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the\ndeep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),\nin which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel\npruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and\npseudo-labelled samples from the target domain.

However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to\nuncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,\nhindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this\nwork, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in\nmodel parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based\nautomated GMA.

This system is known to be of high complexity, and\ndrowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a\nsmall fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning\nabout comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide\nnormal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical\nnotions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we\ndiscuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,\nand what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.\n  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form\nmethods.

On-satellite machine learning (ML) offers a potential\nsolution, by reducing latency associated with transmission of these large data\nvolumes to ground stations, but state-of-the-art models are often too large or\npower-hungry for satellite deployment. Vessel detection using Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR) is a critical time-sensitive task for maritime security\nthat exemplifies this challenge. SAR vessel detection has previously been\ndemonstrated only by ML models that either are too large for satellite\ndeployment, have not been developed for sufficiently low-power hardware, or\nhave only been developed and tested on small SAR datasets that do not\nsufficiently represent the real-world task.

An accurate and robust\nevaluation of its severity is vital to ensure prompt management and care.\nOrdinal regression leverages the underlying inherent order between categories\nto achieve superior performance beyond traditional classification. However,\nthere exist challenges leading to lower DR classification performance: 1) The\nuneven distribution of DR severity levels, characterized by a long-tailed\npattern, adds complexity to the grading process. 2)The ambiguity in defining\ncategory boundaries introduces additional challenges, making the classification\nprocess more complex and prone to inconsistencies.

Recent approaches apply diffusion models (both image-based and\nvideo-based) in this task and achieve strong performance.

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods.

Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack\nflexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce\nMML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural\nlanguage supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of\npartial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we\nemploy Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces\nannotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.\nOur framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical\ntasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete\nor noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a\ncombined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,\nutilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt\nperforms comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of\nhandling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks\nfor the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a\nmore scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the\nannotation burden on clinicians.

However, these developments also raise\nsignificant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,\ntraining data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying\nunauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our\napproach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive\nscore aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness\nof our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for\nLLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image\nscenarios.

However, the\nmajority of 4D capture systems are limited to frame rates below 30 FPS (frames\nper second), and a direct 4D reconstruction of high-speed motion from low FPS\ninput may lead to undesirable results. In this work, we propose a high-speed 4D\ncapturing system only using low FPS cameras, through novel capturing and\nprocessing modules. On the capturing side, we propose an asynchronous capture\nscheme that increases the effective frame rate by staggering the start times of\ncameras. By grouping cameras and leveraging a base frame rate of 25 FPS, our\nmethod achieves an equivalent frame rate of 100-200 FPS without requiring\nspecialized high-speed cameras.

To address this,\nwe have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source\nseparation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly\ntrains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical\nsignal of interest and the other for learning the effective background\ncontribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a\nreconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or\npre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nconsidering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as\nexperimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background\ncontributions and unknown distortions to the target signal.

LiMA\nmaintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational\noverhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream\nLiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves\nboth LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work\ninspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code\nhas be made publicly accessible for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiMA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LiDAR\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u805a\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LiDAR\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LiDAR\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002LiMA\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u805a\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LiMA\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8de8\u5e8f\u5217\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLiMA\u5728LiDAR\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LiMA\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

In this study, we first highlight this issue and attempt\nto achieve the interpretability analysis of DL-based PolSAR image\nclassification technology with the help of Polarimetric Target Decomposition\n(PTD), a feature extraction method related to the scattering mechanism unique\nto the PolSAR image processing field. In our work, by constructing the\npolarimetric conceptual labels and a novel structure named Parallel Concept\nBottleneck Networks (PaCBM), the uninterpretable high-dimensional features are\ntransformed into human-comprehensible concepts based on physically verifiable\npolarimetric scattering mechanisms. Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)\nis used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise\nand understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced\nnon-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR\ndatasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of\nachieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the\nanalytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can\nbe obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the\ninterpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6781\u5316SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6781\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6781\u5316SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ed1\u76d2\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PaCBM\uff09\u548cKolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KAN\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u6761\u51fd\u6570\u89e3\u6790\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6781\u5316SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

From the segmentation of\nconnected lumens (more precisely, blood inside lumens) of an aortic dissection\n3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) image, our previous studies allow us\nto retrieve the intimal flap by using Mathematical Morphology operators, and\ncharacterize intimal tears by 3d thin surfaces that fill them, these surfaces\nare obtained by operating the Aktouf et al. closing algorithm proposed in the\nframework of Digital Topology. Indeed, intimal tears are 3D holes in the\nintimal flap; although it is impossible to directly segment such non-concrete\ndata, it is nevertheless possible to \"materialize\" them with these 3D filling\nsurfaces that may be quantified or make easier the visualization of these\nholes.\n  In this paper, we use these surfaces that fill tears to cut connections\nbetween lumens in order to separate them.\n  This is the first time that surfaces filling tears are used as an image\nprocessing operator (to disconnect several parts of a 3D object). This lumen\nseparation allows us to provide one of the first cartographies of an aortic\ndissection, that may better visually assist physicians during their diagnosis.\n  Our method is able to disconnect lumens, that may also lead to enhance\nseveral current investigations (registration, segmentation, hemodynamics).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u586b\u5145\u6495\u88c2\u76843D\u8868\u9762\u5206\u79bb\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u5939\u5c42\u4e2d\u771f\u5047\u8154\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u5939\u5c42\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e25\u91cd\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7d27\u6025\u5904\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u771f\u5047\u8154\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8f85\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u65ad\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u64cd\u4f5c\u548cAktouf\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u586b\u5145\u6495\u88c2\u76843D\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u5207\u65ad\u8154\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u5939\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5047\u8154\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u586b\u5145\u8868\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7684\u5939\u5c42\u56fe\u8c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982\u914d\u51c6\u3001\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and\nmisaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor\nfrequencies and device malfunctions.

Instead, it relies on class-level alignment\nof the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being\nwell-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we\npropose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment\nClustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the\nproblem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),\nwhich employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to\nidentify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal\ndata.

However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited.

Among its numerous applications, image rendering is crucial.\nNevertheless, rendering methodologies like 3D Gaussian Splatting impose high\ncomputational demands, driven predominantly by user expectations for superior\nvisual quality. This results in notable processing delays for real-time image\nrendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices\nsuch as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual\nbehavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user\nexperience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,\na technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's\ngaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated\nrendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering\nprocess.\n  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the\ncomputational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes\noutweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To\naddress this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework\ncalled~\\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated\nrendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering\nprocesses. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a\nstate-of-the-art neural rendering technique.

In this paper, we\npropose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop\nself-validation process within a dual-system framework.

A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built\nenvironments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater\nvisibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the\ninfluence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed\nmethodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to\nMilan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and\nDubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric\ndesign.

Although numerous networks and deep unfolding methods have been\napplied on similar tasks, they are not fully compatible with DSSI systems\nbecause of their distinct optical encoding mechanism. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient deep unfolding framework for diffractive systems, termed\ndiffractive deep unfolding (DDU). Specifically, we derive an analytical\nsolution for the data fidelity term in DSSI, ensuring both the efficiency and\nthe effectiveness during the iterative reconstruction process. Given the\nseverely ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ a network-based\ninitialization strategy rather than non-learning-based methods or linear\nlayers, leading to enhanced stability and performance. Our framework\ndemonstrates strong compatibility with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,\nwhich effectively address the initialization and prior subproblem. Extensive\nexperiments validate the superiority of the proposed DDU framework, showcasing\nimproved performance while maintaining comparable parameter counts and\ncomputational complexity. These results suggest that DDU provides a solid\nfoundation for future unfolding-based methods in DSSI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDDU\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3DSSI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "DSSI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u72ec\u7279\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDDU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1DDU\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DDU\u4e3aDSSI\u4e2d\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This\nwork introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition\nunder constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one\nfollowing greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics\ncomputed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy\nredistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the\ntop-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget.

Automatic methods, especially data-driven\nmethods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations,\nwhich is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an\nunsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection\nthrough self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from\n4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for\nmanual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric\nmeasurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable\nspatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the\napproach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2\nframes (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised\nmethods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust\nperformance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for\nES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized\nheart views due to fetal heart positioning variability.

Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms\nto leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances\nvision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting\napproach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement\nlearning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve\nvision-language model responses by establishing preferences for\nnavigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided\nVision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and\nvision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve\nperformance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering\ntasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving\ngeneralization to diverse driving scenarios.

While Video-based Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on\nVideo-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,\nlong-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce\nStreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context\nmodeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,\nlanguage and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates\nresponsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,\nwhile the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states\nusing a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN\nachieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,\nsupporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.\nExperiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with\nstable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world\ndeployment.
