### [1] [EvidenceOutcomes: a Dataset of Clinical Trial Publications with Clinically Meaningful Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05380)
*Yiliang Zhou,Abigail M. Newbury,Gongbo Zhang,Betina Ross Idnay,Hao Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了EvidenceOutcomes，一个从生物医学文献中提取临床有意义结果的新型大型标注语料库，解决了现有基准中结果元素被忽视或简化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在循证医学中，结果（Outcomes）是最复杂的PICO元素，但现有基准常忽视或简化其标注。

Method: 通过迭代和临床医生与NLP专家的讨论，制定了标注指南，并由三名独立标注者对500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP摘要的结果和结论部分进行标注。

Result: 标注语料库EvidenceOutcomes的标注质量高，标注者间一致性为0.76；PubMedBERT模型在实体和标记级别的F1分数分别为0.69和0.76。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为共享基准，用于开发和测试未来从生物医学摘要中提取临床有意义结果的机器学习算法。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

### [2] [LLMs Can Also Do Well! Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05385)
*Xinxin Li,Huiyao Chen,Chengjun Liu,Jing Li,Meishan Zhang,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过引入检索增强生成和自我校正机制，使生成式大语言模型（LLM）在语义角色标注（SRL）任务中首次超越编码器-解码器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成式LLM在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但在SRL任务中仍落后于编码器-解码器模型，本文旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（利用外部语言知识）和自我校正（修正不一致输出）两种机制。

Result: 在三个SRL基准测试（CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009、CoNLL-2012）中，该方法在中英文任务中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 这是LLM首次在SRL任务中超越编码器-解码器模型，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

### [3] [Beyond RAG: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Chengshuai Zhao,Yu-Hua Zeng,Yuan Jee Lim,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出R2AG方法，通过强化学习从医学知识图谱中检索推理路径，生成更准确的长篇出院指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法在生成长篇临床笔记时表现不足，尤其是在输入信息有限的情况下。

Method: 提出R2AG方法，结合强化学习和GRO优化检索质量，为LLM提供显式语义指导。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上，R2AG在临床效果和自然语言生成指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: R2AG能填补稀疏输入场景的语义空白，帮助LLM避免临床误解，生成更连贯的推理。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

### [4] [Advancing Decoding Strategies: Enhancements in Locally Typical Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05387)
*Jaydip Sen,Saptarshi Sengupta. Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的局部典型采样算法（ASTS），通过动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励惩罚调整，提升了文本生成的流畅性、多样性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解码方法（如top-k和核采样）在平衡文本生成的流畅性、多样性和连贯性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出自适应语义感知典型性采样（ASTS），结合动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励惩罚调整。

Result: ASTS在多个基准测试中表现优于现有采样技术，减少了重复，增强了语义对齐和流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS是一种高效且有效的解码策略，适用于需要高质量文本生成的任务。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

### [5] [taz2024full: Analysing German Newspapers for Gender Bias and Discrimination across Decades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05388)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: taz2024full是迄今为止最大的公开德语报纸文章语料库，包含1980年至2024年的180万篇文本，用于研究性别偏见等社会问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德语大规模语料资源有限，限制了语言趋势和社会问题（如性别偏见）的研究。

Method: 构建了taz2024full语料库，并通过可扩展的结构化分析流程分析性别代表性。

Result: 研究发现男性在报道中持续被过度代表，但近年逐渐趋于平衡。

Conclusion: 该语料库支持多种应用，促进德语NLP的包容性和可重复性研究。

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

### [6] [Understanding Gender Bias in AI-Generated Product Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05390)
*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在电子商务中生成产品描述时的性别偏见，提出了新的分类方法，并分析了GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM的性别偏见在许多领域已被广泛研究，但在电子商务中的应用尚未深入探讨，可能揭示新的算法偏见和危害。

Method: 开发了数据驱动的性别偏见分类方法，并定量分析了GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM中的偏见问题。

Result: 研究发现电商场景中存在独特的性别偏见形式，如对服装尺寸的假设、产品特征广告中的刻板印象以及说服性语言的使用差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前框架中未充分探索的性别偏见维度，为理解AI在电商中的排斥性规范、刻板印象和性能差异提供了新视角。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

### [7] [Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393)
*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TGTalker框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）应用于动态图学习，解决现有方法在真实世界动态图上的不足，并在链接预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图或合成动态图，而真实世界动态图的应用仍待探索。

Method: TGTalker利用动态图的近期偏好提取结构信息，转化为自然语言供LLMs处理，并结合时序邻居信息进行预测。

Result: 在五个真实网络数据集上，TGTalker表现优于TGN和HTGN等模型，并提供预测的文本解释。

Conclusion: TGTalker为动态图学习提供了新方向，尤其在可解释性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

### [8] [Auto Review: Second Stage Error Detection for Highly Accurate Information Extraction from Phone Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05400)
*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化医疗福利验证电话的系统Auto Review，通过两阶段处理和伪标签方法提高信息提取准确性，减少人工审核负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗福利验证电话的准确性对患者治疗至关重要，但现有系统因语音识别问题和领域术语导致性能瓶颈，需改进。

Method: 采用两阶段处理，结合多ASR替代方案和伪标签方法，无需人工修正转录即可提升准确性。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的系统显著提高了转录质量，增强了Auto Review的效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了语音识别和领域术语带来的挑战，提升了自动化审核的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [9] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AsymKV的训练无关压缩框架，通过利用KV缓存中的不对称性（键的局部同质性和值的异质性分布），显著提升了长上下文建模的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）中注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，而现有的KV缓存压缩方法忽视了键与值之间的不对称性。

Method: 提出AsymKV框架，结合基于同质性的键合并和数学证明的无损值压缩，无需额外训练。

Result: 在LLaMA3.1-8B等模型上，AsymKV在LongBench任务中平均得分43.95，显著优于现有方法（如H$_2$O的38.89）。

Conclusion: AsymKV通过有效利用KV缓存的不对称性，为长上下文建模提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SmoothRot是一种新颖的后训练量化技术，通过结合通道级缩放和Hadamard变换，有效解决大语言模型（LLMs）中4位量化的激活异常值问题，显著提升量化精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在4位量化时面临激活异常值的挑战，影响量化精度。SmoothRot旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SmoothRot结合通道级缩放和Hadamard变换，将极端异常值转化为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 在LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B和Mistral 7B等模型上，SmoothRot将量化模型与FP16模型的性能差距缩小了10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot是一种高效的后训练量化技术，显著提升了4位量化在LLMs中的性能。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是理解用户对Wordle游戏的幽默反应，探索游戏中的哪些特征能引发用户乐趣。

Method: 从Reddit抓取约80k用户反应，用GPT-3.5进行少样本提示分类，提取游戏特征并验证其预测能力。

Result: 特征能弱预测用户乐趣，表明游戏中的创意和幽默可被量化。

Conclusion: 用户对Wordle游戏的乐趣可通过计算部分预测，揭示了游戏设计中幽默的可测量性。

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLM-CL是一个新的多模态大语言模型持续学习基准，解决了动态场景中新知识和技能整合的挑战，通过参数隔离和路由机制显著减少了遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在动态场景中持续学习能力不足，现有基准和方法存在局限性，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制，防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能高效整合新知识和能力，遗忘最小，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL为多模态持续学习提供了有效基准和方法，解决了动态场景中的适应性问题。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

### [13] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究使用无监督机器学习技术分析特定语言障碍（SLI）儿童的语言发展轨迹，发现SLI主要表现为语言产出能力降低而非句法复杂性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法可能忽略细微发展模式，研究旨在通过无监督学习技术更早识别SLI并提供针对性干预。

Method: 分析1,163名4-16岁儿童的叙事样本，使用主成分分析（PCA）和聚类技术评估64种语言特征。

Result: 发现两个主要聚类：高语言产出低SLI患病率组和低产出高句法复杂性高SLI患病率组，支持语言能力的连续模型。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了分类诊断框架，展示了无监督学习在优化诊断标准和干预策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

*Petr Máša*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于增强关联规则的新方法，通过规则到文本的转换，将规则集作为RAG输入到LLM中，显著提升了基于数据集的问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过可解释的机器学习方法（如增强关联规则）改进基于数据集/数据库的答案生成，同时确保方法的安全性（如与RAG技术结合）。

Method: 提出一种方法，基于定义的知识模式生成规则集，通过规则到文本转换器将规则转换为文本形式，并将其作为RAG输入到LLM中。

Result: 与ChatGPT（包括使用代理）相比，该方法在基于数据集的问答中表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法具有潜力，未来可通过引入其他模式、将规则挖掘作为代理等方式进一步优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从电子健康记录中高效准确地回答临床问题的挑战。

Method: 使用大语言模型分两步：1）筛选相关句子；2）生成简短且有引用的回答。采用少样本提示、自一致性和阈值优化句子分类。

Result: 发现较小的8B模型在筛选相关信息时表现优于较大的70B模型，且自一致性与阈值优化提高了句子选择的可靠性。

Conclusion: 准确的句子选择对生成高质量回答至关重要，自一致性与阈值优化能提升决策的可靠性。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

TL;DR: SynthesizeMe通过用户交互生成合成用户角色，用于个性化奖励建模，提升LLM的个性化判断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外身份信息，SynthesizeMe旨在通过用户交互直接生成个性化角色。

Method: 1. 生成并验证解释用户偏好的推理；2. 从推理中生成合成用户角色；3. 筛选信息丰富的用户交互以构建个性化提示。

Result: 使用SynthesizeMe的提示使个性化LLM判断准确性提高4.4%，在PersonalRewardBench上表现最佳。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe提供了一种不依赖额外身份信息的个性化奖励建模方法，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OPERA数据集，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）模拟特定用户网络行为的能力，填补了现有数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM模拟真实用户行为的能力缺乏高质量公开数据集，OPERA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在线问卷和定制浏览器插件收集用户行为数据，包括用户画像、浏览观察、细粒度动作及实时自我报告理由。

Result: 建立了首个基准，评估LLM在给定用户画像和历史数据下预测用户行为和理由的能力。

Conclusion: OPERA为未来研究LLM作为个性化数字孪生体奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于深度Transformer模型的阿尔茨海默病（AD）早期筛查中性别因素对语言异常检测的影响，并提出了两种去性别混淆的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练的语言模型在AD转录本上表现良好，但性别因素对检测结果的影响尚未充分研究，因此需要解决性别混淆问题以提高模型的公平性和准确性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：Extended Confounding Filter和Dual Filter，通过隔离和消除与性别相关的权重来减少性别混淆。

Result: 实验表明，Transformer模型容易过拟合训练数据分布，而消除性别相关权重后，痴呆分类器的性能略有下降，但性别混淆问题得到缓解。

Conclusion: 通过去性别混淆方法，可以在牺牲少量检测性能的情况下，提高痴呆检测模型的公平性。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Result: 实验表明，ID-SPAM在多项任务上优于现有技术，并提升了零样本领域迁移能力。

Conclusion: ID-SPAM是一种简单高效的参数微调方法，适用于特定任务且具有较好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream

Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as

domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究语言模型的记忆机制提供了新工具，同时指出了合成数据设计的难点。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估LLMs在文化背景下表达个性的能力，涵盖六个国家的3000个情景问题，显著提升了模型与人类个性分布的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在互动应用中的普及，个性表达与文化适应性的结合变得至关重要，但现有研究忽视了文化与个性的相互作用。

Method: 引入CulturalPersonas基准测试，包含3000个情景问题，评估三种LLMs的多项选择和开放式回答表现。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著减少了模型与人类个性分布的差异（Wasserstein距离降低20%以上），并生成更具文化一致性的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas为LLMs的全球行为规范对齐提供了新方向，推动了更具社会智能和全球适应性的模型发展。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

TL;DR: MEFA是一个基于多源证据模糊聚合的零样本框架，用于解决事件因果关系识别（ECI）中的因果幻觉问题，通过任务分解和模糊聚合显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ECI模型依赖大规模标注数据，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本ECI中容易产生因果幻觉。MEFA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MEFA将因果关系推理分解为三个主任务和三个辅助任务，利用精心设计的提示引导LLMs生成响应，并通过模糊聚合整合证据进行评分和判定。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MEFA的F1分数和精确度分别比次优无监督基线高6.2%和9.3%，同时显著减少了幻觉导致的错误。

Conclusion: MEFA通过任务分解和模糊聚合有效解决了ECI中的因果幻觉问题，验证了其方法的优越性。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Motivation: 研究动机在于从理论和计算复杂性的角度，统一不同语法形式主义的表示方法，以简化自然语言中非连续结构的分析。

Method: 提出了对应原则（correspondence principle），并通过土耳其语的非连续从属从句案例展示了统一表示的步骤。

Result: 结果表明，统一表示方法能够简化计算复杂性，并为连续和非连续句子的神经认知表示与处理提供新视角。

Conclusion: 结论指出，这种统一表示方法不仅整合了PSG、DG和CG的核心原则，还对句法分析的理论和实践具有重要影响。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Conclusion: GraphRAG在特定场景下表现优异，研究结果为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KD方法在大语言模型中容易导致分布偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题，亟需一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: POCL框架包含难度测量器和训练调度器，逐步引入从易到难的样本，并应用温度逐渐升高的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，POCL能显著提升蒸馏后学生模型的性能，适用于多种KD方法和模型家族。

Conclusion: POCL通过结构化训练数据，有效提升了KD过程的稳定性和性能，为大语言模型的压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法将结构化数据转换为扁平文本，忽略了关键关系结构并导致冗余，而Rel-LLM旨在保留数据库的固有关系结构，使LLM能有效处理复杂实体关系。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM为LLM在关系深度学习中的应用提供了新思路，解决了传统方法的局限性，并展示了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is
available at https://github.com/smiles724/Rel-LLM.

Result: 实验表明，该框架能更真实、严格地评估遗忘效果，并发现现有方法高估了遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器遗忘提供了更准确的评估方法，揭示了现有评估策略的不足。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and

transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

### [33] [BioMol-MQA: A Multi-Modal Question Answering Dataset For LLM Reasoning Over Bio-Molecular Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05766)
*Saptarshi Sengupta,Shuhua Yang,Paul Kwong Yu,Fali Wang,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了BioMol-MQA数据集，用于测试LLMs在多模态知识图谱（KG）上的检索与推理能力，强调现有模型在多模态信息处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG-based LLMs主要针对单模态（文本）信息检索，而现实问题（如医疗领域）需要多模态信息（如知识图谱、文本、分子结构）的检索与推理。

Method: 构建BioMol-MQA数据集，包含多模态知识图谱（文本与分子结构）和设计用于测试LLMs检索与推理能力的复杂问题。

Result: 基准测试显示现有LLMs在多模态KG问题上表现不佳，仅在有背景数据时表现较好，凸显了强RAG框架的必要性。

Conclusion: 多模态信息检索与推理是LLMs的重要挑战，BioMol-MQA为未来研究提供了测试平台。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for
scaling language models efficiently by activating only a subset of parameters

model that activates 14B parameters out of a total of 142B parameters,

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否感知时间流逝并通过实验验证其能力，发现LLMs能将离散的token映射到连续时间，并在时间敏感任务中调整行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在时间推理任务中表现优异，但其对实际时间流逝的感知能力尚未被研究。

Method: 通过三个实验验证：Token-Time假设、响应长度调整实验和动态环境下的BombRush挑战。

Result: LLMs具备一定的时间感知能力，能连接离散token与连续时间，但能力随模型规模和推理能力变化。

Conclusion: 为LLMs在时间敏感应用中增强时间感知能力奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: MAPLE框架通过多智能体协作和长期记忆机制，显著提升了表格问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏错误检测和经验复用机制，与人类问题解决方式不符。

Method: MAPLE包含四个组件：Solver（推理）、Checker（验证）、Reflector（错误诊断）和Archiver（长期记忆）。

Result: 在WiKiTQ和TabFact数据集上表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过模拟人类问题解决过程，显著提升了表格问答任务的推理能力。

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

TL;DR: FinanceReasoning是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在金融数值推理问题中的能力，提供了可信性、全面性和挑战性三方面的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在金融领域的覆盖和评估标准上存在不足，因此需要一个新的基准来更准确地评估和改进LRMs的金融推理能力。

Method: 通过更新和标注问题、构建Python格式化函数以及设计高难度问题，FinanceReasoning提升了评估的准确性和全面性。

Result: 实验表明，结合推理器和编程器模型可以有效提升LRMs的性能（如GPT-4o准确率从83.2%提升至91.6%）。

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning为未来在领域特定复杂推理任务中评估和改进LRMs提供了重要基础。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型在推理时存在跨语言崩溃现象，即模型的思维链倾向于回归到预训练主导语言，即使提示使用其他语言。通过实验发现，训练中的语言不平衡会迅速放大，且语言一致性奖励虽能缓解问题但会降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言大模型（LRMs）在多语言推理中的机制，尤其是跨语言崩溃现象及其影响。

Method: 使用Group-Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）在GSM8K和SimpleRL-Zoo数据集的中文、韩文和乌克兰文版本上微调多语言LRMs，监控任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: 发现GRPO会迅速放大预训练语言不平衡，语言一致性奖励能缓解崩溃但降低准确性，且崩溃现象难以逆转。

Conclusion: 不同语言在推理训练中并不平等，研究揭示了奖励塑造、数据难度和预训练先验在多语言推理中的作用。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出R2-Reasoner框架，通过动态路由子任务到不同规模的语言模型，以平衡准确性和效率，显著降低API成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理虽能提升LLM的问题解决能力，但扩展推理链会增加token使用成本。许多简单子任务可由更高效的小规模模型处理，因此需要一种混合方法。

Method: 提出R2-Reasoner框架，包含任务分解器和子任务分配器，通过强化学习动态路由子任务到不同规模的模型。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，R2-Reasoner将API成本降低86.85%，同时保持或超越基线准确性。

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner为更经济高效的LLM推理提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息对社会构成严重威胁，手动核实成本高且难以扩展，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出MisMitiFact框架，利用轻量级反馈模型对LLM输出进行细粒度修正，确保响应基于事实。

Result: 实验表明，MisMitiFact生成的反驳响应质量与LLM自反馈相当，但反馈生成吞吐量提高了5倍。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact是一种高效、低成本的大规模虚假信息缓解方案。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Motivation: 现有同质MoE-LoRA架构存在表示崩溃和专家负载不平衡问题，限制了LLM的潜力。

Result: 实验表明，异构MoA在性能和参数效率上均优于同质MoE-LoRA方法。

Conclusion: MoA通过异构专家整合提升了预训练知识向下游任务的迁移效果。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Conclusion: DynamicMind通过三模式思维系统有效解决了大型语言模型在动态推理深度和资源分配上的挑战。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their

or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking

Method: 提出IntentionESC框架定义意图，结合ICECoT机制使LLMs模拟人类推理，分析情感状态并选择策略。设计自动化标注管道生成训练数据。

Result: 开发了评估方案并通过实验验证框架有效性。

Conclusion: IntentionESC和ICECoT显著提升了情感支持对话的效果，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Motivation: 解决传统手动创建数学应用题耗时且现有深度学习方法需要额外输入的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成MWP，实验了不同LLM、提示策略、多样性增强技术及人类反馈优化技术。

Result: 生成的MWP质量高，拼写和语法问题少，但在年级和题型适配性上仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLM在MWP生成上表现良好，但需进一步优化以完全满足年级和题型要求。

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的推理时方法Shoes-of-Others（SoO）前缀，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的心理理论（ToM）能力，适用于更广泛的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM推理方法局限于世界状态变化的上下文，而SoO前缀方法减少了对上下文的假设，适用于更广泛的场景。

Method: 提出SoO前缀方法，即在LLM输出前添加“让我们站在A的立场上”的提示，其中A为目标角色名称。

Result: 在对话和叙事上下文的两个基准测试中，SoO前缀方法在五类心理状态上均显著提升了ToM性能。

Conclusion: SoO前缀方法通过引发忠实思考，有效提升了LLMs的ToM能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

that a simple entity-oriented heuristics for context selection can enable text

TL;DR: Tau-Eval是一个开源框架，用于通过隐私和任务敏感性的视角评估文本匿名化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本匿名化在保护隐私的同时需平衡信息保留，但缺乏统一的评估标准。

Result: Tau-Eval为匿名化方法的隐私和效用评估提供了标准化工具。

Conclusion: Tau-Eval填补了文本匿名化评估的空白，支持更全面的方法比较。

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.
A Python library, code, documentation and tutorials are publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在不同语言和文化背景下的性能差异，尤其是文化相关问题的表现。

Method: 结合OCR、自动文本提取和人工验证构建数据集，并测试多种LLM在文化相关问题上的表现。

Result: 模型在国际问题上的准确率（80-95%）显著高于罗马尼亚文化相关问题（50-75%）。

Conclusion: 文化背景和数据来源显著影响LLM性能，需构建更具文化意识的多语言NLP系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 研究CoT在不同任务中效果不一致的机制，探索token概率分布与CoT增益的关系。

Method: 提出两个基于token概率分布的指标，结合逻辑回归模型开发Dynamic CoT，并扩展至闭源模型。

Result: 指标评估CoT效果准确率达89.2%，Dynamic CoT减少35%以上token消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 为CoT机制提供新视角，并提出高效部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AvR（Alignment via Refinement）的新方法，通过长形式的思维链（CoT）提升大语言模型（LLMs）的递归推理能力。AvR通过可微分学习技术优化“细化感知奖励”，显著优于传统偏好优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的递归推理能力有限，尤其是在缺乏专家策划数据的情况下。

Method: AvR方法通过引入批评和改进动作的细化过程，结合可微分学习技术优化细化感知奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示，AvR仅用3k合成样本就将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升了20%以上。

Conclusion: AvR方法有效提升了大语言模型的递归推理能力，展示了其在长形式思维链中的潜力。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有代理搜索方法存在优化不足、评估成本高和搜索效率低的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出分层搜索空间、预测性能模型和分层MCTS策略，结合任务描述高效搜索。

Result: 在七个基准测试中平均性能提升8.34%，搜索效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了代理系统的性能和搜索效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

Motivation: 大语言模型常因参数知识与上下文输入冲突导致事实不一致或幻觉，需要一种方法来可靠地裁决这些冲突。

Method: SR-DCR框架通过一个无上下文的批评者挑战基于上下文的辩护者，并由法官模型评估辩论，结合模型自信度选择最终答案。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR显著提升了对抗误导性上下文的鲁棒性，同时保持对可信输入的准确性，优于传统辩论和仅依赖自信度的方法。

Conclusion: SR-DCR是一种高效且计算开销低的方法，能有效提升语言模型在上下文冲突中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Motivation: 现有ICL方法因重复检索大规模数据而计算成本高，需要更高效的演示选择方法。

Method: 提出FEEDER框架，引入“充分性”和“必要性”指标，设计树状算法高效选择代表性示例。

Result: 实验表明，FEEDER能减少20%以上训练数据量，同时保持性能，并兼容多种下游演示选择策略。

Conclusion: FEEDER显著提升ICL效率，适用于不同规模的LLMs，且不影响性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Method: 构建MATP-BENCH基准，包含1056个多模态数学问题，涵盖高中、大学和竞赛级别，并支持Lean 4、Coq和Isabelle等定理证明框架。

Result: 现有方法仅能解决少量MATP-BENCH问题，表明该基准对自动定理证明研究提出了挑战。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为多模态自动定理证明研究提供了新方向，展示了MLLMs在此领域的潜力与不足。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Result: 实验证明CatShift在无法访问logits的情况下仍有效，适用于开源和API模型。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提取高达56.57%的受害者专属PII，其中“地址”、“生日”和“姓名”最易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究强调了联邦学习中隐私保护的紧迫性，并为未来研究提供了新的基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Conclusion: 任务级条件化对LLM生成代码检测至关重要，ATC方法为实际应用提供了一种高效且无需额外信息的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖未结构化的医学文本，存在噪声和难以利用的问题，缺乏系统化的医学知识组织方法。

Method: 采用半自动化流程（LLM生成、过滤、锚定和人工标注）构建MIRIAD语料库，包含5,821,948个医学QA对。

Result: MIRIAD显著提升了LLMs在医学QA任务中的准确性（最高6.7%）和检测医学幻觉的能力（F1分数提升22.5-37%）。

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗领域的LLM应用提供了更可靠的知识基础，支持多种下游应用，如信息检索和知识驱动的聊天界面。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过模型与数据库引擎的交互（而非监督微调）来优化SQL生成。

Method: 将问题建模为强化学习任务，使用执行反馈作为标量奖励，并采用GRPO框架进行优化。

Result: RL-tuning将SQL生成准确率从31.49提升至49.83，错误率从25.43%降至14.71%，接近更大模型SQLCoder-70B的性能。

Conclusion: 执行反馈能有效提升LLM的符号推理能力。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from

performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能捕捉主观任务中的多视角和标注者分歧，发现零样本设置可行，但少样本设置效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在NLP分类任务中表现优异，但通常依赖多数投票的聚合标签，可能掩盖主观标注中的人类分歧。

Method: 采用上下文学习（ICL）的零样本和少样本设置，评估四种开源LLMs和三种标签建模策略（聚合硬标签、分解硬标签和软标签）。

Result: 零样本设置能生成多视角，少样本设置难以捕捉人类判断的全谱；提示设计和演示选择显著影响性能。

Conclusion: LLMs建模主观性存在挑战，需构建更具视角意识和社会智能的模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语音搜索和重排序的语音校正系统，用于改进端到端自动语音识别（ASR）模型对不常见电影标题的识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量的训练数据获取成本高，端到端ASR模型对不常见电影标题的识别效果较差。

Method: 系统包括语音搜索生成替代选项和重排序组件结合ASR输出选择最终结果。

Result: 在电影标题基准测试中，相对词错误率降低了4.4%至7.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了ASR模型对不常见内容的识别性能。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了自然语言推理（NLI）模型在处理条件句中的预设推理时的表现，并提出了CONFER数据集进行评估。结果显示NLI模型在此任务上表现不佳，且微调对性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索NLI模型在条件句中的预设推理能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入CONFER数据集，评估四种NLI模型及多种大型语言模型（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）在零样本和少样本设置下的表现。

Result: NLI模型在条件句的预设推理任务上表现不佳，微调现有数据集未能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: NLI模型在处理条件句的预设推理时存在局限性，需进一步研究改进方法。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

TL;DR: 介绍了一个名为semantic-features的库，用于研究语言模型的上下文词嵌入，并通过实验验证其在语义解释中的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究上下文词嵌入在语义解释中的作用，特别是不同句法结构对语义的影响。

Method: 使用semantic-features库，设计450对句子，测试两种句法结构对词义解释的影响。

Result: 实验表明，三种掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入对语义敏感性符合预期。

Conclusion: semantic-features工具在语义研究中具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级多代理流程，将大语言模型生成的图表代码错误率从15%降至4.5%，同时发现未来需关注图表美观性、语义保真度和可访问性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在生成可执行图表代码时15%的错误率是否源于模型限制或单提示设计。

Method: 采用多代理流程（起草、执行、修复、判断），仅使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型。

Result: 在Text2Chart31和ChartX基准测试中，错误率分别降至4.5%和4.6%。

Conclusion: 未来工作应转向提升图表美观性、语义保真度和可访问性，而非仅关注执行可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Result: Llama3-8B在结合专家知识的提示下性能最佳，接近GPT-4水平。

Conclusion: 对小模型而言，结合专家知识的提示比CoT技术更有效。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究开放式谜题（puzzlehunts）对评估模型在复杂、多模态和创造性推理中的表现具有重要意义，填补了现有基准测试的空白。

Method: 构建PuzzleWorld基准，包含667个谜题，标注最终答案、详细推理轨迹和认知技能标签，用于评估和诊断模型能力。

Result: 当前模型在最终答案准确率上仅1-2%，最佳模型解决14%谜题，微调推理轨迹可将逐步推理准确率从4%提升至11%。

Conclusion: PuzzleWorld揭示了当前模型的局限性（如短视推理、语言推理瓶颈），为未来开发更通用的开放式推理系统提供支持。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts

Motivation: 在线性别歧视检测面临数据稀疏和语言微妙性的挑战，现有系统在数据不平衡和标注不一致问题上表现不佳。

Method: 采用定义数据增强（DDA）和上下文语义扩展（CSE）生成合成数据，并结合多语言模型的集成策略。

Result: 在EDOS数据集上，二元分类（Task A）和细粒度分类（Task C）的宏F1分别提升了1.5和4.1分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了数据稀疏和标注不一致问题，显著提升了性别歧视检测的性能。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法因知识冲突导致性能下降，缺乏解决机制。

Method: 提出DSSP-RAG框架，采用混合注意力区分共享与私有语义，引入认知不确定性检测和EQ降噪。

Result: 实验表明DSSP-RAG能有效解决冲突，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG通过双流知识协同提升LLMs生成质量与稳定性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理长上下文时，KV缓存的内存消耗和成本较高，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出Cartridge概念，通过离线训练KV缓存，并使用self-study方法生成合成对话以优化训练。

Result: Cartridges在性能上与ICL相当，但内存消耗减少38.6倍，吞吐量提高26.4倍，同时扩展了有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridges结合self-study方法是一种高效且经济的替代方案，适用于长上下文任务。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本摘要中表现出色，但继承了预训练数据中的偏见，导致不公平输出。

Method: AdvSumm引入Perturber组件，在序列到序列模型的嵌入层应用梯度引导扰动，增强模型对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Result: AdvSumm有效减少了名称-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见，且优于标准Transformer和数据增强方法。

Conclusion: AdvSumm在减少偏见的同时保持摘要质量，是一种有效的领域无关训练框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4V）在图像取证任务中的潜力，尤其是在未经特定任务微调的情况下。

Method: 使用CASIA v2.0拼接数据集的子集，通过零样本、少样本和思维链三种提示策略评估GPT-4V的性能。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下达到85%以上的准确率，思维链提示在真实和拼接图像之间表现最平衡。模型还能结合低层视觉特征和上下文知识进行推理。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4V不及专用模型，但其通用性、可解释性和百科全书式推理能力使其成为图像取证中的灵活工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Motivation: CO₂排放是环境和工业过程的关键指标，尤其是在畜牧业管理中。需要一种高效的工具来检测和量化排放。

Method: CarboNeXT整合了多尺度上下文聚合网络、UPerHead和辅助FCN组件，并提出两个新数据集（CCR和RTA）用于评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为CO₂排放分析提供了高效工具，尤其适用于畜牧业和环境监测，支持实时应用和资源受限平台。

Abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions are critical indicators of both
environmental impact and various industrial processes, including livestock
management. We introduce CarboNeXT, a semantic segmentation framework for
Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), designed to detect and quantify CO$_2$ emissions
across diverse applications. Our approach integrates a multi-scale context
aggregation network with UPerHead and auxiliary FCN components to effectively
model both local details and global relationships in gas plume imagery. We
contribute two novel datasets: (1) the Controlled Carbon Dioxide Release (CCR)
dataset, which simulates gas leaks with systematically varied flow rates
(10-100 SCCM), and (2) the Real Time Ankom (RTA) dataset, focusing on emissions
from dairy cow rumen fluid in vitro experiments. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CarboNeXT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
88.46% mIoU on CCR and 92.95% mIoU on RTA, with particular effectiveness in
challenging low-flow scenarios. The model operates at 60.95 FPS, enabling
real-time monitoring applications. Additionally, we propose CarboFormer, a
lightweight variant with only 5.07M parameters that achieves 84.68 FPS, with
competitive performance of 84.88% mIoU on CCR and 92.98% on RTA, making it
suitable for resource-constrained platforms such as programmable drones. Our
work advances both environmental sensing and precision livestock management by
providing robust tools for CO$_2$ emission analysis, with a specific focus on

TL;DR: STFlow是一种基于流匹配的生成模型，通过建模整个切片的基因表达联合分布来考虑细胞间相互作用，解决了现有方法在内存和独立性预测上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）技术因低通量和需要专业设施而应用受限，现有预测方法未考虑细胞间相互作用且内存效率低。

Method: 提出STFlow模型，采用流匹配生成方法建模切片级基因表达联合分布，并结合局部空间注意力编码器以高效处理数据。

Result: 在HEST-1k和STImage-1K4M基准测试中，STFlow显著优于现有方法，相对病理基础模型提升超过18%。

Conclusion: STFlow通过改进建模和编码效率，为空间转录组学数据分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has emerged as a powerful technology for
bridging histology imaging with gene expression profiling. However, its
application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized
experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide
histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they
factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene
expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with
memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in
typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative
model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution
of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level
encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without
excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M
benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.

*Yui Tatsumi,Ziyue Zeng,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种种子选择方法，通过从多个候选种子中选出最优种子，在不增加比特率的情况下提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要额外传输信息以实现可扩展性，而现有扩散方法虽避免了这一点，但使用单一随机种子可能导致图像质量不佳。

Method: 基于反向扩散过程的早期中间输出，从多个候选种子中选择最优种子。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个指标上优于基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加比特率的情况下显著提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Conventional methods for scalable image coding for humans and machines
require the transmission of additional information to achieve scalability. A
recent diffusion-based method avoids this by generating human-oriented images
from machine-oriented images without extra bitrate. This method, however, uses
a single random seed, which may lead to suboptimal image quality. In this
paper, we propose a seed selection method that identifies the optimal seed from
multiple candidates to improve image quality without increasing the bitrate. To
reduce computational cost, the selection is performed based on intermediate
outputs obtained from early steps of the reverse diffusion process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
across multiple metrics.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样场景下生成高质量立体图像，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练模型微调和优化策略，有效解决了立体图像生成问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach to generate stereo
images given a text prompt. Since stereo image datasets with large baselines
are scarce, training a diffusion model from scratch is not feasible. Therefore,
we propose leveraging the strong priors learned by Stable Diffusion and
fine-tuning it on stereo image datasets to adapt it to the task of stereo
generation. To improve stereo consistency and text-to-image alignment, we
further tune the model using prompt alignment and our proposed stereo
consistency reward functions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our approach in generating high-quality stereo images across
diverse scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

Abstract: Rapid spread of false images and videos on online platforms is an emerging
problem. Anyone may add, delete, clone or modify people and entities from an
image using various editing software which are readily available. This
generates false and misleading proof to hide the crime. Now-a-days, these false
and counterfeit images and videos are flooding on the internet. These spread
false information. Many methods are available in literature for detecting those
counterfeit contents but new methods of counterfeiting are also evolving.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are observed to be one effective method
as it modifies the context and definition of images producing plausible results
via image-to-image translation. This work uses an independent discriminant
network that can identify GAN generated image or video. A discriminant network
has been created using a convolutional neural network based on
InceptionResNetV2. The article also proposes a platform where users can detect
forged images and videos. This proposed work has the potential to help the
forensics domain to detect counterfeit videos and hidden criminal evidence

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are one of the most revolutionary inventions
of 21st century. At the core of a UAV lies the central processing system that
uses wireless signals to control their movement. The most popular UAVs are
quadcopters that use a set of four motors, arranged as two on either side with
opposite spin. An autonomous UAV is called a drone. Drones have been in service
in the US army since the 90's for covert missions critical to national
security. It would not be wrong to claim that drones make up an integral part
of the national security and provide the most valuable service during
surveillance operations. While UAVs are controlled using wireless signals,
there reside some challenges that disrupt the operation of such vehicles such
as signal quality and range, real time processing, human expertise, robust
hardware and data security. These challenges can be solved by programming UAVs
to be autonomous, using object detection and tracking, through Computer Vision
algorithms. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that seeks the use of
deep learning to gain a high-level understanding of digital images and videos
for the purpose of automating the task of human visual system. Using computer
vision, algorithms for detecting and tracking various objects can be developed
suitable to the hardware so as to allow real time processing for immediate
judgement. This paper attempts to review the various approaches several authors
have proposed for the purpose of autonomous navigation of UAVs by through
various algorithms of object detection and tracking in real time, for the
purpose of applications in various fields such as disaster management, dense
area exploration, traffic vehicle surveillance etc.

Conclusion: ViT和ResNet结合的方法在公平性人脸认证中有效，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Biometric face authentication is crucial in computer vision, but ensuring
fairness and generalization across demographic groups remains a big challenge.
Therefore, we investigated whether Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet,
leveraging pre-trained global features, can fairly authenticate different
demographic faces while relying minimally on local features. In this
investigation, we used three pre-trained state-of-the-art (SOTA) ViT foundation
models from Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for global features as well as
ResNet-18. We concatenated the features from ViT and ResNet, passed them
through two fully connected layers, and trained on customized face image
datasets to capture the local features. Then, we designed a novel few-shot
prototype network with backbone features embedding. We also developed new
demographic face image support and query datasets for this empirical study. The
network's testing was conducted on this dataset in one-shot, three-shot, and
five-shot scenarios to assess how performance improves as the size of the
support set increases. We observed results across datasets with varying
races/ethnicities, genders, and age groups. The Microsoft Swin Transformer
backbone performed better among the three SOTA ViT for this task. The code and
data are available at: https://github.com/Sufianlab/FairVitBio.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架，结合冷启动和强化学习微调，以同时优化视觉质量评估的评分准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述视为分离任务，导致模型在评分准确性和可解释性之间存在权衡。

Method: 两阶段框架：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏高质量数据；强化学习微调阶段引入新奖励机制（GRPO）联合优化评分和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到SOTA性能，跨域数据集SRCC提升6.5%，且在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了评分与推理的权衡问题，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Result: 在TVSum20和SumMe数据集上，TriPSS表现优于传统单模态和多模态方法，达到最新性能。

Conclusion: TriPSS通过捕捉视觉和语义的细微信息，为大规模视频内容理解设定了新标准。

Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization
and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains
challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that
effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space,
deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from
frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing
these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs
robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video
content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating
quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set
is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art
performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous
multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture
nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for
video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.

TL;DR: Talk2SAM通过结合文本提示改进复杂形状物体的分割，显著提升了SAM-HQ的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割模型（如SAM和SAM-HQ）在处理复杂形状物体（如细长结构或精细边界）时表现不佳，需要更灵活的方法。

Method: 利用CLIP嵌入的文本提示生成语义区域，并将其投影到DINO特征空间，作为SAM-HQ的额外提示。

Result: 在BIG、ThinObject5K和DIS5K基准测试中，Talk2SAM比SAM-HQ提升了5.9% IoU和8.3%边界IoU。

Conclusion: 自然语言引导为复杂物体分割提供了灵活有效的解决方案，尤其在传统方法失效时表现突出。

Abstract: Segmenting objects with complex shapes, such as wires, bicycles, or
structural grids, remains a significant challenge for current segmentation
models, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its high-quality variant
SAM-HQ. These models often struggle with thin structures and fine boundaries,
leading to poor segmentation quality. We propose Talk2SAM, a novel approach
that integrates textual guidance to improve segmentation of such challenging
objects. The method uses CLIP-based embeddings derived from user-provided text
prompts to identify relevant semantic regions, which are then projected into
the DINO feature space. These features serve as additional prompts for SAM-HQ,
enhancing its ability to focus on the target object. Beyond improving
segmentation accuracy, Talk2SAM allows user-controllable segmentation, enabling
disambiguation of objects within a single bounding box based on textual input.
We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks: BIG, ThinObject5K, and DIS5K.
Talk2SAM consistently outperforms SAM-HQ, achieving up to +5.9\% IoU and +8.3\%
boundary IoU improvements. Our results demonstrate that incorporating natural
language guidance provides a flexible and effective means for precise object
segmentation, particularly in cases where traditional prompt-based methods
fail. The source code is available on GitHub:

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive

Result: 在Waymo和CODA等数据集上测试，延迟最大降低57.58%，检测精度最高提升44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE显著提升了VLMs在自动驾驶中的效率和性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Abstract: In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for
the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It
has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental
processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual
reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four
progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its
effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly
detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative
vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual
information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific
workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps
confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify
process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and
an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment

Motivation: 传统图像级自蒸馏假设每张图像仅包含单一对象，但实际场景中常含多个对象，限制了方法的可扩展性和对复杂场景的适应性。

Method: ODIS通过对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力机制，将自蒸馏粒度从图像级细化到对象级，简化任务并提升语义理解。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large上实现了82.6%的k-NN准确率，显著提升了图像和补丁级别的视觉表示。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏有效解决了多对象场景的挑战，为复杂视觉任务提供了更优的预训练方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

TL;DR: 研究评估了111个视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中的表现，发现大多数模型表现不佳，而人类表现优异。少数表现较好的VLMs依赖启发式方法，但整体上VLMs尚未具备自然交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视线推断是人类自然交互的关键能力，研究旨在评估VLMs是否具备类似能力。

Method: 通过控制实验比较111个VLMs和65名人类参与者在不同难度和场景下的表现，使用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不如随机猜测，人类表现接近完美。少数VLMs表现优于随机，但其表现受任务难度影响。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏视线推断能力，但仍有潜力成为自然交互技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench是首个针对动态3D场景中空间推理的基准测试，结合了同步空间音频。SAVVY是一种无需训练的两阶段推理方法，显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AV-LLMs和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，缺乏对动态3D空间推理的研究。

Method: SAVVY包含两个阶段：(i) 利用AV-LLMs和其他视听方法跟踪关键对象轨迹，(ii) 构建全局动态地图并通过坐标转换回答问题。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能，为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法填补了动态3D空间推理的研究空白，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于HDF5的开放格式替代STEP格式，并提供了配套的开源库和数据集，解决了STEP格式在机器学习流程中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STEP格式需要CAD内核处理，限制了其在大型学习流程中的应用，尤其是计算集群部署时的高许可成本。

Method: 开发了基于HDF5的开放格式和开源库，支持查询和处理，并提供了采样、法线和曲率等标准功能。

Result: 成功转换了Fusion 360和ABC数据集，并通过四个标准用例验证了数据的完整性和与原STEP文件的一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的HDF5格式和工具显著提升了CAD数据在机器学习中的可用性和部署灵活性。

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) generated from computer-aided design (CAD) is
widely used in industry, with several large datasets available. However, the
data in these datasets is represented in STEP format, requiring a CAD kernel to
read and process it. This dramatically limits their scope and usage in large
learning pipelines, as it constrains the possibility of deploying them on
computing clusters due to the high cost of per-node licenses.
  This paper introduces an alternative format based on the open, cross-platform
format HDF5 and a corresponding dataset for STEP files, paired with an
open-source library to query and process them. Our Python package also provides
standard functionalities such as sampling, normals, and curvature to ease
integration in existing pipelines.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our format, we converted the Fusion 360
dataset and the ABC dataset. We developed four standard use cases (normal
estimation, denoising, surface reconstruction, and segmentation) to assess the
integrity of the data and its compliance with the original STEP files.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉强化学习中图像观察因干扰元素（如阴影、云、光线）导致的任务无关特征问题，尤其是在训练中未暴露这些干扰的情况下。

Method: SPD方法通过并行使用弱增强和强增强，学习通过预测双向增强版本之间的逆向和正向转换来提取特征。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观察中优于先前研究，并显著提升了对未见观察的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法能有效提取任务相关特征，提升模型在复杂和未见观察中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

Result: 在DeepMind Control suite和Robosuite的复杂背景测试中，性能分别提升117%和14%。

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提升了MBRL模型对视觉干扰的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RF-based MPPE方法要么预处理复杂耗时，要么直接处理原始信号导致精度低，需改进效率和性能。

Method: 将RF信号子分组，使用共享单层CNN嵌入后结合多头注意力，并设计自监督学习预测掩码数据的潜在表示。

Result: 模型在PCKh@0.5指标上提升15%，自监督方法显著增强新场景和多人场景下的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在效率和精度上均优于现有技术，尤其适用于复杂环境和多人场景。

Abstract: In the field of Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE), Radio Frequency
(RF)-based methods can operate effectively regardless of lighting conditions
and obscured line-of-sight situations. Existing RF-based MPPE methods typically
involve either 1) converting RF signals into heatmap images through complex
preprocessing, or 2) applying a deep embedding network directly to raw RF
signals. The first approach, while delivering decent performance, is
computationally intensive and time-consuming. The second method, though simpler
in preprocessing, results in lower MPPE accuracy and generalization
performance. This paper proposes an efficient and lightweight one-stage MPPE
model based on raw RF signals. By sub-grouping RF signals and embedding them
using a shared single-layer CNN followed by multi-head attention, this model
outperforms previous methods that embed all signals at once through a large and
deep CNN. Additionally, we propose a new self-supervised learning (SSL) method
that takes inputs from both one unmasked subgroup and the remaining masked
subgroups to predict the latent representations of the masked data. Empirical
results demonstrate that our model improves MPPE accuracy by up to 15 in
PCKh@0.5 compared to previous methods using raw RF signals. Especially, the
proposed SSL method has shown to significantly enhance performance improvements
when placed in new locations or in front of obstacles at RF antennas,
contributing to greater performance gains as the number of people increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类社交互动的复杂性和多模态特性对人工智能提出了巨大挑战，需要更先进的评估工具来推动研究。

Method: 通过2,792个视频片段和8,792个问题-答案对，结合人类与LLM协作生成数据，覆盖多种视频类型和文化背景。

Result: 实验显示MLLMs在SSU表现良好，但在SSR和SDP（尤其是关系推理）上表现较差，转录对话对理解复杂社交互动至关重要。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但对小扰动的敏感性限制了其鲁棒性，尤其是在实际部署中。

Method: 训练一个通用的替代模型，能够同时处理图像和文本输入，生成联合表示，并进一步生成针对文本和图像模态的对抗性扰动。

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了视觉语言模型的脆弱性，为提升其鲁棒性提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Conclusion: 该方法为视频分类模型的鲁棒性评估提供了更有效的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Result: CLIP视觉特征提供可读语义信息，语言解码器能补偿视觉特征的不足，恢复性能。

Conclusion: 未来可设计更多依赖语言解码器的VLM架构，优化视觉与语言模块的动态分工。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 结构化数据和紧凑模型显著提升了自动驾驶决策任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote

learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

Abstract: Image degradation is a prevalent issue in various real-world applications,
affecting visual quality and downstream processing tasks. In this study, we
propose a novel framework that employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
automatically classify degraded images into predefined categories. The VLM
categorizes an input image into one of four degradation types: (A)
super-resolution degradation (including noise, blur, and JPEG compression), (B)
reflection artifacts, (C) motion blur, or (D) no visible degradation
(high-quality image). Once classified, images assigned to categories A, B, or C
undergo targeted restoration using dedicated models tailored for each specific
degradation type. The final output is a restored image with improved visual
quality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
accurately classifying image degradations and enhancing image quality through
specialized restoration models. Our method presents a scalable and automated
solution for real-world image enhancement tasks, leveraging the capabilities of
VLMs in conjunction with state-of-the-art restoration techniques.

this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted
AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features
from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive
loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these
techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its
generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic
evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with
images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR
achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and
localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code,
data and models will be publicly available at alex-costanzino.github.io/radar.

### [109] [S2GO: Streaming Sparse Gaussian Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05473)
*Jinhyung Park,Yihan Hu,Chensheng Peng,Wenzhao Zheng,Kris Kitani,Wei Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2GO提出了一种基于稀疏查询的3D表示方法，通过动态传播查询并解码为语义高斯分布，显著提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法依赖密集表示（如体素或高斯分布），效率低且难以捕捉动态场景。S2GO旨在通过稀疏查询解决这些问题。

Method: 将场景总结为一组紧凑的3D查询，动态传播并解码为语义高斯分布，结合去噪渲染目标优化查询和分布。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI基准测试中，S2GO以1.5 IoU的优势超越GaussianWorld，推理速度快5.9倍。

Conclusion: 稀疏查询表示在3D占用预测中具有高效性和灵活性，S2GO为动态场景建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated efficiency and performance of sparse query-based
representations for perception, state-of-the-art 3D occupancy prediction
methods still rely on voxel-based or dense Gaussian-based 3D representations.
However, dense representations are slow, and they lack flexibility in capturing
the temporal dynamics of driving scenes. Distinct from prior work, we instead
summarize the scene into a compact set of 3D queries which are propagated
through time in an online, streaming fashion. These queries are then decoded
into semantic Gaussians at each timestep. We couple our framework with a
denoising rendering objective to guide the queries and their constituent
Gaussians in effectively capturing scene geometry. Owing to its efficient,
query-based representation, S2GO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
nuScenes and KITTI occupancy benchmarks, outperforming prior art (e.g.,
GaussianWorld) by 1.5 IoU with 5.9x faster inference.

Abstract: Removing reflections is a crucial task in computer vision, with significant
applications in photography and image enhancement. Nevertheless, existing
methods are constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and
diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark for Single Image
Reflection Removal (SIRR). We have developed a large-scale dataset containing
5,300 high-quality, pixel-aligned image pairs, each consisting of a reflection
image and its corresponding clean version. Specifically, the dataset is divided
into two parts: 5,000 images are used for training, and 300 images are used for
validation. Additionally, we have included 100 real-world testing images
without ground truth (GT) to further evaluate the practical performance of
reflection removal methods. All image pairs are precisely aligned at the pixel
level to guarantee accurate supervision. The dataset encompasses a broad
spectrum of real-world scenarios, featuring various lighting conditions, object
types, and reflection patterns, and is segmented into training, validation, and
test sets to facilitate thorough evaluation. To validate the usefulness of our
dataset, we train a U-Net-based model and evaluate it using five widely-used
metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS, and NIQE. We will release both the
dataset and the code on https://github.com/caijie0620/OpenRR-5k to facilitate
future research in this field.

Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory.
Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We
designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention.
This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing
a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the
first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training
the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that
the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and
feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and
attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human
cognition using neural network models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法通常针对固定放大因子训练，无法灵活处理超出训练分布的尺度或退化问题。

Method: 采用分层时空纹理编码框架和多分辨率隐式哈希编码，实现从低分辨率输入自适应解码高分辨率和无噪声帧。

Result: VR-INR在未见尺度和噪声情况下保持高质量重建，在清晰度、细节保留和去噪效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VR-INR展示了隐式神经表示在视频修复中的强大泛化能力和灵活性。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) videos play a crucial role in many computer vision
applications. Although existing video restoration (VR) methods can
significantly enhance video quality by exploiting temporal information across
video frames, they are typically trained for fixed upscaling factors and lack
the flexibility to handle scales or degradations beyond their training
distribution. In this paper, we introduce VR-INR, a novel video restoration
approach based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that is trained only
on a single upscaling factor ($\times 4$) but generalizes effectively to
arbitrary, unseen super-resolution scales at test time. Notably, VR-INR also
performs zero-shot denoising on noisy input, despite never having seen noisy
data during training. Our method employs a hierarchical
spatial-temporal-texture encoding framework coupled with multi-resolution
implicit hash encoding, enabling adaptive decoding of high-resolution and
noise-suppressed frames from low-resolution inputs at any desired
magnification. Experimental results show that VR-INR consistently maintains
high-quality reconstructions at unseen scales and noise during training,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in sharpness, detail
preservation, and denoising efficacy.

Motivation: 图像中由玻璃表面引起的反射会显著降低图像质量，而现有方法难以有效处理这些复杂多变的反射。

Method: 提出F2T2-HiT架构，结合FFT Transformer块（利用频域信息分离反射）和分层Transformer块（多尺度特征提取）。

Result: 在三个公开测试数据集上表现出色，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: F2T2-HiT架构能有效处理复杂反射，提升图像质量。

Abstract: Single Image Reflection Removal (SIRR) technique plays a crucial role in
image processing by eliminating unwanted reflections from the background. These
reflections, often caused by photographs taken through glass surfaces, can
significantly degrade image quality. SIRR remains a challenging problem due to
the complex and varied reflections encountered in real-world scenarios. These
reflections vary significantly in intensity, shapes, light sources, sizes, and
coverage areas across the image, posing challenges for most existing methods to
effectively handle all cases. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a U-shaped Fast Fourier Transform Transformer and Hierarchical
Transformer (F2T2-HiT) architecture, an innovative Transformer-based design for
SIRR. Our approach uniquely combines Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Transformer
blocks and Hierarchical Transformer blocks within a UNet framework. The FFT
Transformer blocks leverage the global frequency domain information to
effectively capture and separate reflection patterns, while the Hierarchical
Transformer blocks utilize multi-scale feature extraction to handle reflections
of varying sizes and complexities. Extensive experiments conducted on three
publicly available testing datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance,
validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在细粒度语义对齐上表现不佳，无法实现精确控制。

Method: 提出FocusDiff，构建包含相似表达但局部语义不同的数据集，并引入强化学习算法强调细粒度差异。

Result: 在现有基准测试中达到最优性能，并在PairComp上显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: FocusDiff通过关注细粒度语义差异，有效提升了文本到图像生成的精确控制能力。

Abstract: Recent studies extend the autoregression paradigm to text-to-image
generation, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models. However, our
new PairComp benchmark -- featuring test cases of paired prompts with similar
syntax but different fine-grained semantics -- reveals that existing models
struggle with fine-grained text-image alignment thus failing to realize precise
control over visual tokens. To address this, we propose FocusDiff, which
enhances fine-grained text-image semantic alignment by focusing on subtle
differences between similar text-image pairs. We construct a new dataset of
paired texts and images with similar overall expressions but distinct local
semantics, further introducing a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to
emphasize such fine-grained semantic differences for desired image generation.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing text-to-image
benchmarks and significantly outperforms prior methods on PairComp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在时间复杂性、推理技能覆盖和可扩展性方面存在不足，无法满足多模态智能的需求。

Method: 通过程序化生成500个脚本视频片段，结合Python脚本、生成视频模型和真实素材，控制视觉复杂度和时间动态。

Result: 实验显示当前最先进模型在所有推理类别中表现不足，尤其在抽象和规划任务上。

Conclusion: MORSE-500为多模态推理研究提供了透明、可扩展的测试环境，支持未来模型的持续评估。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Motivation: 现有基于概念的神经网络解释存在概念不一致问题，且缺乏用户反馈机制，导致解释与用户理解不匹配。

Method: 提出YoursProtoP，通过用户交互调整原型部分（视觉概念），使其更符合用户偏好。

Result: 在FunnyBirds、CUB、CARS和PETS数据集上验证，YoursProtoP在保持模型准确性的同时实现了概念一致性。

Conclusion: YoursProtoP有效解决了概念不一致问题，提升了模型解释的用户友好性。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretable neural networks have gained significant attention
due to their intuitive and easy-to-understand explanations based on case-based
reasoning, such as "this bird looks like those sparrows". However, a major
limitation is that these explanations may not always be comprehensible to users
due to concept inconsistency, where multiple visual features are
inappropriately mixed (e.g., a bird's head and wings treated as a single
concept). This inconsistency breaks the alignment between model reasoning and
human understanding. Furthermore, users have specific preferences for how
concepts should look, yet current approaches provide no mechanism for
incorporating their feedback. To address these issues, we introduce
YoursProtoP, a novel interactive strategy that enables the personalization of
prototypical parts - the visual concepts used by the model - according to user
needs. By incorporating user supervision, YoursProtoP adapts and splits
concepts used for both prediction and explanation to better match the user's
preferences and understanding. Through experiments on both the synthetic
FunnyBirds dataset and a real-world scenario using the CUB, CARS, and PETS
datasets in a comprehensive user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
YoursProtoP in achieving concept consistency without compromising the accuracy
of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编码器（如DINO或CLIP）缺乏时间感知，而视频模型（如VideoMAE）在密集预测任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种新的视频编码器来解决这一差距。

Method: FRAME通过自监督学习预测当前和未来的DINO补丁特征，同时将类标记与CLIP的语义空间对齐，支持语言驱动任务。

Result: 在七个数据集的六个密集预测任务中，FRAME表现优于图像编码器和现有自监督视频模型。

Conclusion: FRAME是一种紧凑且多功能的视频编码器，适用于多种下游应用，填补了密集视频理解领域的空白。

Abstract: Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic
segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent,
spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall
short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video
models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense
prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame
encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current
and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to
spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge,
FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense
prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual
correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with
CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video
classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven
datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing
self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a
compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.

Result: 3D模型的分割预测显著优于2D基线，证明3D技术可增强动态现象的2D分析。

Conclusion: 3D技术即使在动态场景中也能有效提升2D分析效果。

Abstract: Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still
relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building
on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors
have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from
independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is
particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is
significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In
fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques
are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in
particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this
issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D
by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered
radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long,
dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric
structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the
(incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time
refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing
the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the
refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that
surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques
can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and
realistic setting.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视觉感知和推理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理视觉模糊或无语义场景文本时容易产生语义幻觉（即生成视觉错误但语义合理的答案）。论文旨在探究其原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个无需训练的框架，包括两个关键组件：1) ZoomText，一种从粗到细的文本区域识别策略；2) Grounded Layer Correction，利用不易产生幻觉的层内部表示来指导解码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅能有效缓解语义幻觉，还在场景文本识别和理解公共基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了语义幻觉的成因，并提出了一种无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了模型在复杂场景下的表现。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual
perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or
non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand
the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually
incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work,
we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a
key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene
text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we
propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising
two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies
potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer
Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers
less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs
for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To
enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of over
1,730 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually
curated question-answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic
hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for
scene text spotting and understanding.

Conclusion: EX-4D通过创新的几何表示和训练策略，显著提升了极端视角视频生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality camera-controllable videos from monocular input is a
challenging task, particularly under extreme viewpoint. Existing methods often
struggle with geometric inconsistencies and occlusion artifacts in boundaries,
leading to degraded visual quality. In this paper, we introduce EX-4D, a novel
framework that addresses these challenges through a Depth Watertight Mesh
representation. The representation serves as a robust geometric prior by
explicitly modeling both visible and occluded regions, ensuring geometric
consistency in extreme camera pose. To overcome the lack of paired multi-view
datasets, we propose a simulated masking strategy that generates effective
training data only from monocular videos. Additionally, a lightweight
LoRA-based video diffusion adapter is employed to synthesize high-quality,
physically consistent, and temporally coherent videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EX-4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
physical consistency and extreme-view quality, enabling practical 4D video
generation.

Abstract: Radiance field methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) allow easy
reconstruction from photos, enabling free-viewpoint navigation. Nonetheless,
pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still
each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete.
SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera
baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera
poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense
and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes.
To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned
features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct
sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning
primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two
efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian
primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing
scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives,
storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives
are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint.
We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution
can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes
we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle
specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.

Abstract: Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the
simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents
significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and
unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and
their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization
framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D
Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced
Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method
decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them
onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the
camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D
semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene
flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow
of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent
frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy
models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat
in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Method: PartCrafter基于预训练的3D网格扩散变换器（DiT），引入组合潜在空间和分层注意力机制，实现端到端的部分感知生成。

Result: 实验表明，PartCrafter在生成可分解3D网格方面优于现有方法，包括不可见部分的生成。

Conclusion: PartCrafter展示了部分感知生成先验在3D理解和合成中的优势，代码和训练数据将公开。

Abstract: We introduce PartCrafter, the first structured 3D generative model that
jointly synthesizes multiple semantically meaningful and geometrically distinct
3D meshes from a single RGB image. Unlike existing methods that either produce
monolithic 3D shapes or follow two-stage pipelines, i.e., first segmenting an
image and then reconstructing each segment, PartCrafter adopts a unified,
compositional generation architecture that does not rely on pre-segmented
inputs. Conditioned on a single image, it simultaneously denoises multiple 3D
parts, enabling end-to-end part-aware generation of both individual objects and
complex multi-object scenes. PartCrafter builds upon a pretrained 3D mesh
diffusion transformer (DiT) trained on whole objects, inheriting the pretrained
weights, encoder, and decoder, and introduces two key innovations: (1) A
compositional latent space, where each 3D part is represented by a set of
disentangled latent tokens; (2) A hierarchical attention mechanism that enables
structured information flow both within individual parts and across all parts,
ensuring global coherence while preserving part-level detail during generation.
To support part-level supervision, we curate a new dataset by mining part-level
annotations from large-scale 3D object datasets. Experiments show that
PartCrafter outperforms existing approaches in generating decomposable 3D
meshes, including parts that are not directly visible in input images,
demonstrating the strength of part-aware generative priors for 3D understanding
and synthesis. Code and training data will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UniRes的扩散框架，用于处理复杂混合的图像退化问题，通过结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，实现了对野外复杂退化的端到端恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像退化问题多样且复杂，现有方法难以泛化到野外数据，因此需要一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出UniRes框架，结合多个专用模型在扩散采样步骤中，利用统一公式实现灵活扩展，并调整保真度与质量的权衡。

Result: 在复杂退化和单一退化数据集上均表现出性能提升，尤其在复杂退化图像上效果显著。

Conclusion: UniRes框架通过结合多个专用模型，有效解决了复杂退化问题，且具有灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Real-world image restoration is hampered by diverse degradations stemming
from varying capture conditions, capture devices and post-processing pipelines.
Existing works make improvements through simulating those degradations and
leveraging image generative priors, however generalization to in-the-wild data
remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we focus on complex degradations,
i.e., arbitrary mixtures of multiple types of known degradations, which is
frequently seen in the wild. A simple yet flexible diffusionbased framework,
named UniRes, is proposed to address such degradations in an end-to-end manner.
It combines several specialized models during the diffusion sampling steps,
hence transferring the knowledge from several well-isolated restoration tasks
to the restoration of complex in-the-wild degradations. This only requires
well-isolated training data for several degradation types. The framework is
flexible as extensions can be added through a unified formulation, and the
fidelity-quality trade-off can be adjusted through a new paradigm. Our proposed
method is evaluated on both complex-degradation and single-degradation image
restoration datasets. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show consistent performance gain especially for images with complex
degradations.

Motivation: Real-SR因低分辨率图像的复杂退化模式而具有挑战性，现有方法未能有效平衡不同退化模式的处理。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，包括任务定义（参数化退化空间）、基于焦点损失的任务权重机制和自适应数据再平衡。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在所有退化任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过任务定义、不平衡量化和数据再平衡的协同改进，实现了Real-SR的优化。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR) is a challenging problem due to
the complex degradation patterns in low-resolution images. Unlike approaches
that assume a broadly encompassing degradation space, we focus specifically on
achieving an optimal balance in how SR networks handle different degradation
patterns within a fixed degradation space. We propose an improved paradigm that
frames Real-SR as a data-heterogeneous multi-task learning problem, our work
addresses task imbalance in the paradigm through coordinated advancements in
task definition, imbalance quantification, and adaptive data rebalancing.
Specifically, we introduce a novel task definition framework that segments the
degradation space by setting parameter-specific boundaries for degradation
operators, effectively reducing the task quantity while maintaining task
discrimination. We then develop a focal loss based multi-task weighting
mechanism that precisely quantifies task imbalance dynamics during model
training. Furthermore, to prevent sporadic outlier samples from dominating the
gradient optimization of the shared multi-task SR model, we strategically
convert the quantified task imbalance into controlled data rebalancing through
deliberate regulation of task-specific training volumes. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves consistent
superiority across all degradation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种迭代视觉接地框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）作为结构化关系先验，以解决视觉关系检测（VRD）模型对固定谓词集的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VRD模型依赖固定谓词集，难以泛化到新交互关系。本文旨在通过视觉接地框架，利用LLM生成未标注但语义合理的关系假设。

Method: 采用期望最大化（EM）启发的方法，交替使用LLM生成候选场景图（期望）和训练视觉模型对齐感知证据（最大化）。

Result: 在Visual Genome的新基准测试中，模型在谓词分类任务上的平均召回率（mR@50）分别为15.9（已见）、13.1（未见）和11.7（混合），优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的视觉接地框架能有效提升开放世界视觉理解的泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding relationships between objects is central to visual
intelligence, with applications in embodied AI, assistive systems, and scene
understanding. Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a
fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key
challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but
unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work
introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by
expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating
candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and
training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence
(maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond
annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally,
we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21
held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed.
Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving
mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on
these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors
for scalable open-world visual understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了航空与近距离场景的关键差异，如沿极线的深度范围变化和低细节航空图像的特征匹配不敏感问题。

Method: ADR-MVS通过深度范围预测器生成自适应范围图，结合交叉注意力差异学习，分阶段优化深度估计，并设计了法线引导的成本聚合和深度细化模块。

Conclusion: ADR-MVS通过自适应深度范围和法线引导技术，显著提升了航空图像三维重建的精度和效率。

Abstract: Three-dimensional digital urban reconstruction from multi-view aerial images
is a critical application where deep multi-view stereo (MVS) methods outperform
traditional techniques. However, existing methods commonly overlook the key
differences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth
ranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with
low-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive
Depth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve
multi-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth
range predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal
estimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the
range map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth
boundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating
convergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are
progressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for
precise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation
is specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness
within the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement
module that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results
demonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,
LuoJia-MVS, and M\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational
complexity.

Motivation: 颅外组织在脑MRI中可能对健康评估和临床决策有重要价值，但现有工具未广泛验证，尤其是在发育中的大脑或病理情况下。

Method: TissUnet基于155对MRI-CT扫描训练，并在包括脑肿瘤患者的多个数据集中验证，使用Dice系数评估性能。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人中Dice系数中位数为0.79，在健康个体和肿瘤病例中分别为0.83和0.81，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TissUnet能快速、准确、可重复地分割颅外组织，支持大规模研究。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 点云和视频表示的最优模型在多个3D理解基准测试中达到最优结果，强调了标记结构分析的重要性，并提倡透明报告多种子平均结果以推动领域发展。

Abstract: Effectively representing 3D scenes for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is crucial yet challenging. Existing approaches commonly only rely on
2D image features and use varied tokenization approaches. This work presents a
rigorous study of 3D token structures, systematically comparing video-based and
point-based representations while maintaining consistent model backbones and
parameters. We propose a novel approach that enriches visual tokens by
incorporating 3D point cloud features from a Sonata pretrained Point
Transformer V3 encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that merging explicit 3D
features significantly boosts performance. Furthermore, we show that
point-based token structures can rival video-based ones when the points are
cleverly sampled and ordered. Our best models from both structures achieve
state-of-the-art results on multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. We emphasize
our analysis of token structures as a key contribution, alongside transparent
reporting of results averaged over multiple seeds, a practice we believe is
vital for robust progress in the field.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型缺乏对内容道德维度的理解和推理能力，而这是人类认知的关键方面。

Method: MoralCLIP将视觉和文本道德线索整合到统一的嵌入空间中，采用道德数据增强策略，基于Social-Moral Image Database数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，明确的道德监督提高了单模态和多模态对道德内容的理解能力。

Conclusion: MoralCLIP为具备道德意识的AI系统奠定了基础，能够识别并与人类道德价值观对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled rich semantic
understanding across modalities. However, these encoding methods lack the
ability to interpret or reason about the moral dimensions of content-a crucial
aspect of human cognition. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
MoralCLIP, a novel embedding representation method that extends multimodal
learning with explicit moral grounding based on Moral Foundations Theory (MFT).
Our approach integrates visual and textual moral cues into a unified embedding
space, enabling cross-modal moral alignment. MoralCLIP is grounded on the
multi-label dataset Social-Moral Image Database to identify co-occurring moral
foundations in visual content. For MoralCLIP training, we design a moral data
augmentation strategy to scale our annotated dataset to 15,000 image-text pairs
labeled with MFT-aligned dimensions. Our results demonstrate that explicit
moral supervision improves both unimodal and multimodal understanding of moral
content, establishing a foundation for morally-aware AI systems capable of
recognizing and aligning with human moral values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉Transformer计算成本高，动态压缩token成为研究热点，但现有方法导致信息损失且需后训练恢复性能。

Method: 将token压缩统一为显式的token矩阵变换，提出多对多的Token Transforming框架，保留最多信息并支持免训练加速。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少40% FLOPs，加速DeiT-S 1.5倍，精度仅下降0.1%，并在密集预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更好的计算-性能权衡，显著降低了计算成本和推理时间。

Abstract: Vision transformers have been widely explored in various vision tasks. Due to
heavy computational cost, much interest has aroused for compressing vision
transformer dynamically in the aspect of tokens. Current methods mainly pay
attention to token pruning or merging to reduce token numbers, in which tokens
are compressed exclusively, causing great information loss and therefore
post-training is inevitably required to recover the performance. In this paper,
we rethink token reduction and unify the process as an explicit form of token
matrix transformation, in which all existing methods are constructing special
forms of matrices within the framework. Furthermore, we propose a many-to-many
Token Transforming framework that serves as a generalization of all existing
methods and reserves the most information, even enabling training-free
acceleration. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework.
Specifically, we reduce 40% FLOPs and accelerate DeiT-S by $\times$1.5 with
marginal 0.1% accuracy drop. Furthermore, we extend the method to dense
prediction tasks including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation,
and language model generation. Results demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently achieves substantial improvements, offering a better
computation-performance trade-off, impressive budget reduction and inference
acceleration.

Result: 在GAPart数据集上验证了姿态估计能力，合成训练模型在真实场景中实现200Hz实时反馈，机器人可交互未见物体。

Conclusion: YOEO方法高效且实用，适用于实时机器人任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of category-level pose estimation for
articulated objects in robotic manipulation tasks. Recent works have shown
promising results in estimating part pose and size at the category level.
However, these approaches primarily follow a complex multi-stage pipeline that
first segments part instances in the point cloud and then estimates the
Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) representation for 6D poses. These
approaches suffer from high computational costs and low performance in
real-time robotic tasks. To address these limitations, we propose YOEO, a
single-stage method that simultaneously outputs instance segmentation and NPCS
representations in an end-to-end manner. We use a unified network to generate
point-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same
part instance to vote for the same centroid. We further utilize a clustering
algorithm to distinguish points based on their estimated centroid distances.
Finally, we first separate the NPCS region of each instance. Then, we align the
separated regions with the real point cloud to recover the final pose and size.
Experimental results on the GAPart dataset demonstrate the pose estimation
capabilities of our proposed single-shot method. We also deploy our
synthetically-trained model in a real-world setting, providing real-time visual
feedback at 200Hz, enabling a physical Kinova robot to interact with unseen
articulated objects. This showcases the utility and effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Motivation: 解决多边形近似评估中Rosin优值计算耗时的问题，探索加权优值是否可作为替代。

Method: 通过理论分析、实验验证和统计方法（Pearson相关系数）研究两种优值的关系。

Result: 理论证明和实验均表明两种优值独立且无相关性。

Conclusion: 加权优值不能替代Rosin优值，因其无法得出与Rosin优值一致的结论。

Abstract: Many studies had been conducted to solve the problem of approximating a
digital boundary by piece straight-line segments for further processing
required in computer vision applications. The authors of these studies compared
their schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the
goodness of a polygonal approximation was figure of merit. Later, it was
pointed out that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason
and this is why Rosin - through mathematical analysis - introduced a measure
called merit. However, this measure involves optimal scheme of polygonal
approximation and so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness
of an approximation. This led many researchers to use weighted figure of merit
as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare among sub-optimal schemes. An
attempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two measures -
weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure - are related so that one can be
used instead of the other and towards this end theoretical analysis,
experimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The
mathematical formula for weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are
analyzed and through proof of theorems it is found that the two measures are
independent of each other theoretically. The graphical analysis of experiments
carried out using public dataset supports theoretical analysis. The statistical
analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient also establishes that the two
measures are uncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a
sub-optimal scheme is found to be better (worse) than some other sub-optimal
scheme as indicated by Rosin's measure then the same conclusion cannot be drawn
using weighted figure of merit and so one cannot use weighted figure of merit
instead of Rosin's measure.

consistency. We evaluated our method on four synthetic and three real datasets

Method: 通过构建一个包含真实和虚假错觉的VQA数据集，评估LVLMs在区分实际和表观特征上的表现。

Result: LVLMs虽然能回答关于两种特征的问题，但对真实和虚假错觉的回答相同，表明其可能依赖先验知识而非真实视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs的视觉理解可能依赖于先验知识而非实际感知，数据集为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Method: 1. 为每个数据点添加时间戳偏移特征；2. 使用数据增强模拟实际部署中的传感器延迟模式。

Result: 在传感器数据同步和延迟条件下，新方法均能保持稳定的高性能，而传统方法在数据延迟时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决传感器数据延迟问题，提升自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Abstract: This report presents our solution to the Ego4D Natural Language Queries (NLQ)
Challenge at CVPR 2025. Egocentric video captures the scene from the wearer's
perspective, where gaze serves as a key non-verbal communication cue that
reflects visual attention and offer insights into human intention and
cognition. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, GazeNLQ, which
leverages gaze to retrieve video segments that match given natural language
queries. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning-based pretraining
strategy for gaze estimation directly from video. The estimated gaze is used to
augment video representations within proposed model, thereby enhancing
localization accuracy. Experimental results show that GazeNLQ achieves
R1@IoU0.3 and R1@IoU0.5 scores of 27.82 and 18.68, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have gained wide adoption in the virtual human
generation due to their outstanding expressiveness. However, their substantial
computational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time
interactive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration
requirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video
generation framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.
Firstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the
minimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,
which significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a
consistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure
real-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation. Model quantization
and pipeline parallelism are further employed to accelerate the inference
speed. To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and
model quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for
long-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and
low latency while maintaining high-fidelity output. Thirdly, we incorporate
class labels as a conditional input to seamlessly switch between speaking,
listening, and idle states. Lastly, we design a novel mechanism for
fine-grained facial expression control to exploit our model's inherent
capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
low-latency, fluid, and authentic two-way communication. On an NVIDIA RTX
4090D, our model achieves a maximum of 78 FPS at a resolution of 384x384 and 45
FPS at a resolution of 512x512, with an initial video generation latency of 140
ms and 215 ms, respectively.

Result: 在四个3D血管分割数据集上的实验验证了DeformCL的有效性和优越性，临床可视化也证明了其意义。

Conclusion: DeformCL在血管提取中表现出色，为3D医学影像分析提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of 3D medical imaging, accurately extracting and representing
the blood vessels with curvilinear structures holds paramount importance for
clinical diagnosis. Previous methods have commonly relied on discrete
representation like mask, often resulting in local fractures or scattered
fragments due to the inherent limitations of the per-pixel classification
paradigm. In this work, we introduce DeformCL, a new continuous representation
based on Deformable Centerlines, where centerline points act as nodes connected
by edges that capture spatial relationships. Compared with previous
representations, DeformCL offers three key advantages: natural connectivity,
noise robustness, and interaction facility. We present a comprehensive training
pipeline structured in a cascaded manner to fully exploit these favorable
properties of DeformCL. Extensive experiments on four 3D vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.
Furthermore, the visualization of curved planar reformation images validates
the clinical significance of the proposed framework. We release the code in

Result: 在多个医学图像分割数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提高了特征利用率并减少了网络参数。

Conclusion: 该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种UNet类网络，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 事件视觉技术快速发展，但传感器数据流中存在大量噪声，受光照和温度等因素影响。

Method: 设计并实现了DIF滤波器硬件架构，在FPGA芯片上运行，并创建了一个高分辨率事件数据集用于评估。

Result: DIF滤波器在1280x720分辨率下吞吐量为403.39 MEPS，640x480下为428.45 MEPS，AUROC指数在0.844到0.999之间，性能优于现有方案。

Conclusion: DIF滤波器在高效处理噪声的同时，具有高吞吐量和广泛的噪声适应能力，性能与现有方案相当甚至更优。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of event
vision. It manifests itself both on the technical side, as better and better
event sensors are available, and on the algorithmic side, as more and more
applications of this technology are proposed and scientific papers are
published. However, the data stream from these sensors typically contains a
significant amount of noise, which varies depending on factors such as the
degree of illumination in the observed scene or the temperature of the sensor.
We propose a hardware architecture of the Distance-based Interpolation with
Frequency Weights (DIF) filter and implement it on an FPGA chip. To evaluate
the algorithm and compare it with other solutions, we have prepared a new
high-resolution event dataset, which we are also releasing to the community.
Our architecture achieved a throughput of 403.39 million events per second
(MEPS) for a sensor resolution of 1280 x 720 and 428.45 MEPS for a resolution
of 640 x 480. The average values of the Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUROC) index ranged from 0.844 to 0.999, depending on the
dataset, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art filtering solutions, but
with much higher throughput and better operation over a wide range of noise
levels.

TL;DR: FontAdapter是一个快速生成未见字体视觉文本的框架，通过两阶段课程学习实现高质量字体定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对预设字体外的适配计算成本高，FontAdapter旨在实现秒级未见字体生成。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：先提取字体属性，再整合到自然背景中，并构建合成数据集支持训练。

Result: FontAdapter无需额外微调即可实现高质量字体定制，支持多种字体任务。

Conclusion: FontAdapter是一个多功能字体定制框架，高效且通用。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the seamless
integration of visual text into diverse image contexts. Recent approaches
further improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined
font dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is
computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time
customization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework
that enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned
on a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font
datasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to
new glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning
approach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated
glyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To
support this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets
tailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.
Experiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font
customization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during
inference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,
and cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile
framework for font customization tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Method: 采用区域感知空间引导和注意力驱动的时序特征融合机制，结合多尺度服装特征和姿势对齐，确保时空连续性和细节保留。

Result: 实验表明，ChronoTailor在时空连续性和服装细节保留上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChronoTailor通过创新的时空注意力机制和多尺度特征融合，有效提升了视频虚拟试穿的质量。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a
source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field,
existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment
details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework
that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained
garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to
guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves
robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial
guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an
attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous
temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local
editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics.
Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve
low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to
ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect
StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments,
and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will
be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that
ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details
during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Result: 在217名患者的验证集上，32张SPAT图像的准确性显著高于单张传统光照图像。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Cryo-EM中，姿态估计和3D重建仍依赖耗时的迭代优化，主要由于低信噪比和对比传递函数畸变等挑战。

Method: 通过整合多视图特征并在大规模模拟Cryo-EM数据上训练，结合渐进式训练策略提升模型稳健性。

Result: 实验表明，CryoFastAR在合成和真实数据集上均显著加速推理，同时保持可比质量。

Conclusion: CryoFastAR为Cryo-EM领域提供了一种高效且准确的姿态估计新方法。

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction,
robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as
DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in
scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D
reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming
iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise
ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We
introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly
predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By
integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM
data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose
estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we
propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract
essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing
difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves
comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional
iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强和生成方法在跨域少样本目标检测中效果有限，难以同时保证视觉真实性和域对齐。

Method: Domain-RAG分为三阶段：域感知背景检索、域引导背景生成和前景-背景合成，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，Domain-RAG在多个任务中优于基线方法，达到新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Domain-RAG是一种高效、无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了跨域少样本目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects
with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While
data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot
learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for
both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as
copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve
the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target
domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these
challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided
compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG
consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided
background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the
input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then
retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative
model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and
retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the
newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without
requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces
high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including
CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show
consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new
state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HMVLM通过三项创新显著提升了自动驾驶的高层意图生成和轨迹规划能力。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and

*Yiheng Li,Yang Yang,Zichang Tan,Huan Liu,Weihua Chen,Xu Zhou,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CSCL的新方法，通过多模态一致性学习提升假新闻检测的细粒度感知能力，实验证明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索局部内容的细粒度一致性方面不足，导致对伪造细节的感知不充分和结果不可靠。

Method: 建立了图像和文本模态的两个分支，每个分支包含两个级联解码器（CCD和SCD），分别捕捉模态内上下文一致性和跨模态语义一致性。

Result: 在DGM4数据集上的实验表明，CSCL取得了新的最优性能，尤其是在定位伪造内容方面。

Conclusion: CSCL通过细粒度一致性学习显著提升了伪造检测的性能，为多模态媒体操纵检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding
multi-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,
most state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency
within local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed
forgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
named Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the
fine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and
text modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,
i.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder
(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality
semantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same
criteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each
module first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional
supervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the
forgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues
based on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove
that CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results
of grounding manipulated content. Codes and weights are avaliable at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在临床应用中至关重要，但现有方法（如Transformer）在中小器官上效果不佳且计算资源需求高。

Method: 使用Mask2Former结合可变形注意力，提出偏移调整策略和辅助训练头，优化分割性能。

Result: 模型在HaNSeg和SegRap2023数据集上达到SOTA性能，尤其对中小器官分割效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 改进的Mask2Former模型有效解决了医学图像分割中的资源消耗和中小器官分割难题。

Abstract: Medical segmentation plays an important role in clinical applications like
radiation therapy and surgical guidance, but acquiring clinically acceptable
results is difficult. In recent years, progress has been witnessed with the
success of utilizing transformer-like models, such as combining the attention
mechanism with CNN. In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can
extract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of
CNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer
architecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be
resource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the
medical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with
compact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory. For example, using
ViT to segment medical images directly only gives a DSC of less than 50\%,
which is far lower than the clinically acceptable score of 80\%. In this paper,
we used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and
proposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the
same organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact
foreground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in
Mask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based
auxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show
that our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and
SegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is

*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标RSS，用于全面衡量半监督语义分割模型的准确性、可靠性和鲁棒性，填补了当前评估协议的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半监督分割评估仅关注准确性，忽略了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 引入Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)，通过调和平均值结合预测准确性、校准和不确定性质量。

Result: 实验表明半监督方法常以可靠性换取准确性，UniMatchV2在鲁棒性上表现良好，但仍存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用更全面的评估指标（如RSS），以更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

TL;DR: FADE是一种无需训练的视频编辑方法，通过频率感知分解利用预训练视频扩散模型的先验知识，解决了现有方法在视频动态编辑中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像扩散模型在视频编辑中难以处理动态内容，而视频扩散模型虽能生成高质量结果，但直接应用图像编辑技术效率低下。

Method: 通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，提出频率感知分解策略优化各组件功能，并设计频谱引导调制以细化采样轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，FADE在真实视频中实现了高质量、真实且时间一致的编辑效果。

Conclusion: FADE为视频编辑提供了一种高效且多功能的方法，无需额外训练即可利用预训练模型的先验知识。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的动作生成方法在同时实现高保真度、流式生成、实时响应和可扩展性方面仍存在挑战。

Method: MOGO包含MoSA-VQ（动作尺度自适应残差向量量化模块）和RQHC-Transformer（残差量化分层因果Transformer），并通过文本条件对齐机制提升语义保真度。

Conclusion: MOGO为高效、实时的动作生成提供了新思路，显著提升了生成质量和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于NeRF或3DGS的SLAM方法在动态环境中表现不佳，尤其是仅依赖RGB输入时。Dy3DGS-SLAM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过概率模型融合光流掩码和深度掩码生成动态掩码，设计运动损失约束位姿估计网络，并使用渲染损失消除动态对象的干扰。

Result: 实验表明，Dy3DGS-SLAM在动态环境中的跟踪和渲染性能优于或匹配现有的RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: Dy3DGS-SLAM为动态场景SLAM提供了一种高效的纯RGB输入解决方案，性能达到先进水平。

Abstract: Current Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods based on Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting excel in reconstructing static
3D scenes but struggle with tracking and reconstruction in dynamic
environments, such as real-world scenes with moving elements. Existing
NeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on
RGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic
interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a
probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network
iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.
Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain
the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss
of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and
occlusion caused by dynamic objects. Experimental results demonstrate that
Dy3DGS-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking and rendering in dynamic
environments, outperforming or matching existing RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了全面的框架，指出了当前研究的不足，并支持DA技术在农业图像分析中的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the increasing use of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has
become crucial for tasks like crop health monitoring and pest detection.
However, significant domain shifts between source and target domains-due to
environmental differences, crop types, and data acquisition methods-pose
challenges. These domain gaps limit the ability of models to generalize across
regions, seasons, and complex agricultural environments. This paper explores
how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges, focusing on
their role in enhancing the cross-domain transferability of agricultural image
analysis. DA has gained attention in agricultural vision tasks due to its
potential to mitigate domain heterogeneity. The paper systematically reviews
recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, particularly its practical
applications in complex agricultural environments. We examine the key drivers
for adopting DA in agriculture, such as limited labeled data, weak model
transferability, and dynamic environmental conditions. We also discuss its use
in crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, highlighting
improvements in performance across regions and seasons. The paper categorizes
DA methods into shallow and deep learning models, with further divisions into
supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A special focus is
given to adversarial learning-based DA methods, which have shown great promise
in challenging agricultural scenarios. Finally, we review key public datasets
in agricultural imagery, analyzing their value and limitations in DA research.
This review provides a comprehensive framework for researchers, offering
insights into current research gaps and supporting the advancement of DA
methods in agricultural image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MCA-Bench，一个统一的多模态CAPTCHA基准测试套件，用于评估其安全性，并提出了设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPTCHA方案缺乏统一的大规模多模态基准测试，难以评估其安全性。

Method: 通过共享的视觉-语言模型框架，为每种CAPTCHA类型微调专用破解代理，实现跨模态评估。

Result: MCA-Bench揭示了现代CAPTCHA设计的漏洞谱，并首次量化分析了挑战复杂性、交互深度与模型可解性的关系。

Conclusion: 提出了三项可操作的设计原则，为CAPTCHA加固、公平基准测试和社区合作奠定了基础。

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical
defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes
encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and
obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based
questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal
benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this
gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking
suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation
protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune
specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,
cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench
effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under
varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of
how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.
Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and
identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA
hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and
code are available online.

Method: 通过监督学习微调基础模型获得动态模型，并采用两种策略（弱监督学习和推理时验证）引导世界模型的构建。提出新的目标函数，加权图像标记的重要性。

Result: 在Aurora-Bench图像编辑任务中，最佳模型性能优于现有方法15%（基于GPT4o评估），并在人类评估中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 动态模型可通过监督学习获得，并能有效引导世界模型的构建，最终在图像编辑任务中取得显著提升。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving

generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Stereo video generation has been gaining increasing attention with recent
advancements in video diffusion models. However, most existing methods focus on
generating 3D stereoscopic videos from monocular 2D videos. These approaches
typically assume that the input monocular video is of high quality, making the
task primarily about inpainting occluded regions in the warped video while
preserving disoccluded areas. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline that
not only generates stereo videos but also enhances both left-view and
right-view videos consistently with a single model. Our approach achieves this
by fine-tuning the model on degraded data for restoration, as well as
conditioning the model on warped masks for consistent stereo generation. As a
result, our method can be fine-tuned on a relatively small synthetic stereo
video datasets and applied to low-quality real-world videos, performing both
stereo video generation and restoration. Experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively in
stereo video generation from low-resolution inputs.

Motivation: 现有DBP方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，而研究发现不同样本需要不同的噪声水平，尤其是样本越干净，注入的噪声应越少。

Method: SSNI利用预训练的评分网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度，并根据评分范数动态调整噪声水平。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K数据集上，SSNI显著提升了DBP方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在DBP方法中为不同样本分配不同的噪声水平是必要的，SSNI框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决从大脑活动中准确重建高复杂度视觉信息的挑战，包括元素密度、多样性和复杂语义信息。

Method: HAVIR包含两个适配器：AutoKL适配器将fMRI体素转换为潜在扩散先验，捕捉拓扑结构；CLIP适配器将体素转换为CLIP文本和图像嵌入，包含语义信息。两者通过Versatile Diffusion融合生成最终图像。

Result: 实验表明，HAVIR能有效重建复杂场景中的结构特征和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR通过结合拓扑结构和语义信息，成功解决了从fMRI数据中重建复杂视觉刺激的难题。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Conclusion: FIS层是一种高效且通用的张量处理工具，适用于多种深度学习任务。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种浅层-深层协同检测网络（SDS-Net），通过双分支架构和自适应特征融合模块，解决了红外小目标检测中浅层与深层特征协作不足的问题，显著提升了检测精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于CNN的红外小目标检测方法忽视了浅层与深层特征的异质性，导致特征协作不足，且缺乏对跨层次特征依赖关系的系统性建模，影响了检测性能和计算效率。

Method: 提出SDS-Net，采用双分支架构分别建模特征的结构特性和语义属性，并引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，SDS-Net在检测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDS-Net通过高效的多层次特征建模，显著提升了红外小目标检测的性能，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像分析中的可靠性，提出了一种新的全适应共形预测框架（full conformal adaptation），并结合SS-Text方法提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在医学图像分析中表现出强大的判别能力，但其可靠性尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出全适应共形预测框架，结合SS-Text方法，利用少量样本进行适应和共形化。

Result: 在9个适应任务中，框架在保持相同覆盖保证的同时，相对效率提升高达27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为VLMs在医学图像分析中的可靠性提供了有效解决方案，且无需额外数据。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained at large scale have shown
unprecedented transferability capabilities and are being progressively
integrated into medical image analysis. Although its discriminative potential
has been widely explored, its reliability aspect remains overlooked. This work
investigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal
prediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level
on output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot
performance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves
few-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid
exchangeability assumptions of SCP. To alleviate this issue, we propose full
conformal adaptation, a novel setting for jointly adapting and conformalizing
pre-trained foundation models, which operates transductively over each test
data point using a few-shot adaptation set. Moreover, we complement this
framework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that
alleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide
comprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs
and 9 adaptation tasks. Our framework requires exactly the same data as SCP,
and provides consistent relative improvements of up to 27% on set efficiency
while maintaining the same coverage guarantees.

TL;DR: WisWheat是一个针对小麦管理的专用数据集，通过三层设计提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在小麦管理任务中的性能，显著优于通用商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小麦管理依赖人工专家检查，成本高且难以扩展。现有VLMs缺乏领域知识，导致在小麦管理任务中表现不佳。

Method: WisWheat数据集包括三层：基础预训练数据集、定量数据集和指令微调数据集，用于增强VLMs在小麦形态、定量测量和诊断管理中的能力。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5 VL 7B在小麦压力和生长阶段任务中分别达到79.2%和84.6%的准确率，显著优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: WisWheat数据集显著提升了VLMs在小麦管理任务中的性能，为农业智能化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Wheat management strategies play a critical role in determining yield.
Traditional management decisions often rely on labour-intensive expert
inspections, which are expensive, subjective and difficult to scale. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to enable
scalable, data-driven management support. However, due to a lack of
domain-specific knowledge, directly applying VLMs to wheat management tasks
results in poor quantification and reasoning capabilities, ultimately producing
vague or even misleading management recommendations. In response, we propose
WisWheat, a wheat-specific dataset with a three-layered design to enhance VLM
performance on wheat management tasks: (1) a foundational pretraining dataset
of 47,871 image-caption pairs for coarsely adapting VLMs to wheat morphology;
(2) a quantitative dataset comprising 7,263 VQA-style image-question-answer
triplets for quantitative trait measuring tasks; and (3) an Instruction
Fine-tuning dataset with 4,888 samples targeting biotic and abiotic stress
diagnosis and management plan for different phenological stages. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source VLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5 7B) on our dataset leads to significant performance improvements.
Specifically, the Qwen2.5 VL 7B fine-tuned on our wheat instruction dataset
achieves accuracy scores of 79.2% and 84.6% on wheat stress and growth stage
conversation tasks respectively, surpassing even general-purpose commercial
models such as GPT-4o by a margin of 11.9% and 34.6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应的反馈引导方法（FBG），通过动态调整引导量来改进条件扩散模型的样本保真度，避免了固定引导可能导致的多样性和记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定引导（如CFG）可能因对所有样本应用相同的引导量而损害多样性和导致记忆问题，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: FBG通过状态相关的系数动态调整引导量，基于条件信号的信息量反馈自适应地调节引导。

Result: 在ImageNet512x512上，FBG显著优于CFG，并与LIG竞争，同时在文本到图像生成中表现出对不同复杂度提示的自适应能力。

Conclusion: FBG提供了一种数学框架支持的动态引导方法，能够灵活适应不同样本需求，并可与其他引导方案结合使用。

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample
fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce
memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular
sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a
state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need.
Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned
conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional
distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our
scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal
informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the
view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on
ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance
and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a
strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate
that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales
for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined
with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

*David Wan,Han Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Jaemin Cho,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLaMR是一种多模态视频内容检索系统，通过动态选择最佳模态组合提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索系统通常独立处理多模态信息，导致检索效果不佳，因此需要一种能动态选择最佳模态的方法。

Method: CLaMR联合编码视频帧、语音转录、屏幕文本和元数据，并通过多模态训练数据集MultiVENT 2.0++和模态感知损失函数进行训练。

Result: CLaMR在MultiVENT 2.0++和MSRVTT测试集上显著优于单模态和多模态基线检索器，nDCG@10分别提升25.6和35.4。

Conclusion: CLaMR在多模态视频检索中表现优异，并在长视频问答任务中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

TL;DR: VideoChat-A1是一种新型长视频代理范式，通过链式镜头推理逐步选择相关镜头，模仿人类思维过程，显著提升长视频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中因忽略多镜头结构而表现不佳，需更深入理解相关镜头。

Method: 采用链式镜头推理，逐步选择相关镜头并进行粗到细的分区多模态推理。

Result: 在主流长视频QA基准测试中表现最佳，如VideoMME（77.0）和EgoSchema（70.1），优于基线模型。

Conclusion: VideoChat-A1通过模仿人类思维过程，显著提升长视频理解能力，且效率更高。

Abstract: The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,
while suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer
context. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been
proposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a
long video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video
is composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long
video, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.
Without such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy
temporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To
fill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.
Different from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long
videos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it
can progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into
these shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the
shot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking
process, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for
thoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our
VideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long
video QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,
outperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and
InternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\% and 6.2\%. Compared to leading close-source
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, VideoChat-A1 offers competitive accuracy, but with
7\% input frames and 12\% inference time on average.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双向引导的低光图像增强框架（BiLIE），通过频率高通滤波和双向交叉注意力融合机制，解决了事件相机在低光环境下噪声和结构不连续性问题，并提供了新数据集RELIE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在极端低光条件下存在动态范围和时间分辨率限制，导致图像细节丢失和运动模糊。现有事件引导的低光增强算法忽略了动态光照引起的低频噪声和稀疏事件数据的局部结构不连续性。

Method: 提出BiLIE框架，包括事件特征增强（EFE）模块和双向交叉注意力融合（BCAF）机制，分别抑制低频噪声和结构不连续性，并生成平滑融合表示。

Result: 实验表明，BiLIE在PSNR和LPIPS指标上分别优于现有方法0.96dB和0.03。

Conclusion: BiLIE有效解决了事件相机在低光环境下的噪声和结构问题，并通过新数据集RELIE提升了视觉质量和色彩准确性。

Abstract: Under extreme low-light conditions, traditional frame-based cameras, due to
their limited dynamic range and temporal resolution, face detail loss and
motion blur in captured images. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have
introduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement
algorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global
low-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural
discontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an
innovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).
Specifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by
global illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass
filtering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event
representation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,
and preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a
Bidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency
structures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local
noise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused
representations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color
bias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality
ground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量向量化输入和计算密集型Transformer架构，限制了实际应用。

Result: CCLSTM在占用流指标上达到最先进性能，并在Waymo挑战赛中排名第一。

Conclusion: CCLSTM是一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，适用于实际自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Predicting future states of dynamic agents is a fundamental task in
autonomous driving. An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy
Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion,
spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have
achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on
high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate
in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are
computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end
trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without
relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively
captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a
compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM
achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this
submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.

Motivation: 细粒度作物分类对精准农业和粮食安全监测至关重要，但现有研究因高光谱数据获取和标注成本高而稀缺。

Method: 构建了H2Crop数据集，结合EnMAP高光谱数据和Sentinel-2时间序列，提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理光谱-空间和时间特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为细粒度作物分类和高光谱图像处理提供了重要基准，证明了高光谱数据的持续优势。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Conclusion: MF$^2$为评估模型对长视频内容的深层理解提供了新标准，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Abstract: In this report, we address the task of online mistake detection, which is
vital in domains like industrial automation and education, where real-time
video analysis allows human operators to correct errors as they occur. While
previous work focuses on procedural errors involving action order, broader
error types must be addressed for real-world use. We introduce an online
mistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors
(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large
language model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback. Experiments on the
HoloAssist benchmark confirm the effectiveness of our approach, where our
approach is placed second on the mistake detection task.

Abstract: We propose SatelliteFormula, a novel symbolic regression framework that
derives physically interpretable expressions directly from multi-spectral
remote sensing imagery. Unlike traditional empirical indices or black-box
learning models, SatelliteFormula combines a Vision Transformer-based encoder
for spatial-spectral feature extraction with physics-guided constraints to
ensure consistency and interpretability. Existing symbolic regression methods
struggle with the high-dimensional complexity of multi-spectral data; our
method addresses this by integrating transformer representations into a
symbolic optimizer that balances accuracy and physical plausibility. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets and remote sensing tasks demonstrate superior
performance, stability, and generalization compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. SatelliteFormula enables interpretable modeling of complex
environmental variables, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and
physical understanding.

understanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The
framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset
using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for
efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model
evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first
benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs
based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target
off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint
and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk
assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert
VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or
LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle
actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial
capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios
spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified
multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings
in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in
complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for
architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By
addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the
development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文本到图像检索中表现良好，但实际应用中用户的多轮交互需求未被充分满足，且现有方法的反馈机制模糊低效。

Result: 实验表明，GenIR在多轮MIR任务中显著优于现有交互方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为心理图像检索任务提供了新方法、数据集和基础，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在内窥镜领域的潜力，特别是腹腔镜手术，以填补传统计算机视觉模型在该领域的不足。

Method: 使用多种最先进的VLMs、多个手术数据集和大量人工标注，评估VLMs在基础感知和高级场景理解任务中的表现，并比较专业医学VLMs与通用模型的性能。

Result: VLMs在基础任务（如物体计数和定位）上表现良好，但在需要医学知识的任务上表现显著下降；专业医学VLMs目前表现不如通用模型。

Conclusion: VLMs在手术领域仍有改进空间，需进一步优化以应对手术环境的复杂性，为下一代内窥镜AI系统的发展提供方向。

Abstract: While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.

Conclusion: 优化后的远程加载配置在相同时间内达到与本地训练相同的精度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Training deep learning models on petabyte-scale Earth observation (EO) data
requires separating compute resources from data storage. However, standard
PyTorch data loaders cannot keep modern GPUs utilized when streaming GeoTIFF
files directly from cloud storage. In this work, we benchmark GeoTIFF loading
throughput from both cloud object storage and local SSD, systematically testing
different loader configurations and data parameters. We focus on tile-aligned
reads and worker thread pools, using Bayesian optimization to find optimal
settings for each storage type. Our optimized configurations increase remote
data loading throughput by 20x and local throughput by 4x compared to default
settings. On three public EO benchmarks, models trained with optimized remote
loading achieve the same accuracy as local training within identical time
budgets. We improve validation IoU by 6-15% and maintain 85-95% GPU utilization
versus 0-30% with standard configurations. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Visual Graph Arena（VGA）数据集，用于评估和改进AI系统在视觉抽象能力上的表现，揭示了当前AI模型在视觉理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中取得突破，但仍缺乏人类的基本能力——‘概念化’，即识别和推理同一概念在不同视觉形式下的能力。

Method: 通过VGA数据集，设计六种基于图的任务，测试AI系统在不同视觉形式下的推理能力。

Result: 实验显示人类在任务中表现近乎完美，而AI模型在异构检测中完全失败，路径/循环任务中表现有限，表明其行为模式匹配而非真正理解。

Conclusion: VGA为AI视觉模型提供了评估框架，推动其向人类概念化能力发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Perceiving the world from both egocentric (first-person) and exocentric
(third-person) perspectives is fundamental to human cognition, enabling rich
and complementary understanding of dynamic environments. In recent years,
allowing the machines to leverage the synergistic potential of these dual
perspectives has emerged as a compelling research direction in video
understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of video
understanding from both exocentric and egocentric viewpoints. We begin by
highlighting the practical applications of integrating egocentric and
exocentric techniques, envisioning their potential collaboration across
domains. We then identify key research tasks to realize these applications.
Next, we systematically organize and review recent advancements into three main
research directions: (1) leveraging egocentric data to enhance exocentric
understanding, (2) utilizing exocentric data to improve egocentric analysis,
and (3) joint learning frameworks that unify both perspectives. For each
direction, we analyze a diverse set of tasks and relevant works. Additionally,
we discuss benchmark datasets that support research in both perspectives,
evaluating their scope, diversity, and applicability. Finally, we discuss
limitations in current works and propose promising future research directions.
By synthesizing insights from both perspectives, our goal is to inspire
advancements in video understanding and artificial intelligence, bringing
machines closer to perceiving the world in a human-like manner. A GitHub repo

Result: 在实验中显著优于现有方法，实现了高质量的重光照和动画控制。

Conclusion: BecomingLit在重光照和动画控制方面表现出色，为头部化身重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce BecomingLit, a novel method for reconstructing relightable,
high-resolution head avatars that can be rendered from novel viewpoints at
interactive rates. Therefore, we propose a new low-cost light stage capture
setup, tailored specifically towards capturing faces. Using this setup, we
collect a novel dataset consisting of diverse multi-view sequences of numerous
subjects under varying illumination conditions and facial expressions. By
leveraging our new dataset, we introduce a new relightable avatar
representation based on 3D Gaussian primitives that we animate with a
parametric head model and an expression-dependent dynamics module. We propose a
new hybrid neural shading approach, combining a neural diffuse BRDF with an
analytical specular term. Our method reconstructs disentangled materials from
our dynamic light stage recordings and enables all-frequency relighting of our
avatars with both point lights and environment maps. In addition, our avatars
can easily be animated and controlled from monocular videos. We validate our
approach in extensive experiments on our dataset, where we consistently
outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in relighting and reenactment by a
significant margin.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像合成中归一化流的可扩展性和性能问题，同时保持其理论优势。

Method: 提出TARFlow（Transformer Autoregressive Flow），结合深度-浅层设计、潜在空间建模和新颖的引导算法。

Result: 在类条件和文本条件图像生成任务中表现优异，接近扩散模型的样本质量。

Conclusion: 首次证明了归一化流在大规模高分辨率图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows
that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core
of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the
expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities
of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality
of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation,
we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to
significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep
Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity,
complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally
efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of
pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level
modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample
quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling
exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization.
STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and
text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion
models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful
demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and
resolution.

3521 expert-curated video question-answer pairs spanning 11 physical activities
in 6 domains: Sports, Bike Repair, Cooking, Health, Music, and Dance. ExAct
requires the correct answer to be selected from five carefully designed
candidate options, thus necessitating a nuanced, fine-grained, expert-level
understanding of physical human skills. Evaluating the recent state-of-the-art
VLMs on ExAct reveals a substantial performance gap relative to human expert
performance. Specifically, the best-performing GPT-4o model achieves only
44.70% accuracy, well below the 82.02% attained by trained human

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在视觉特征与语言模型对齐时存在注意力分配不均和2D结构关系丢失的问题。

Method: 提出了双路径架构（Context图像路径和Memory图像路径）和RoPE-DHR位置编码机制。

Result: 在七个基准测试中表现优于传统LVLM架构。

Conclusion: CoMemo有效解决了视觉信息忽视和2D结构关系问题，提升了多模态处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models built upon Large Language
Models have established aligning visual features with LLM representations as
the dominant paradigm. However, inherited LLM architectural designs introduce
suboptimal characteristics for multimodal processing. First, LVLMs exhibit a
bimodal distribution in attention allocation, leading to the progressive
neglect of middle visual content as context expands. Second, conventional
positional encoding schemes fail to preserve vital 2D structural relationships
when processing dynamic high-resolution images. To address these limitations,
we propose CoMemo - a dual-path architecture that combines a Context image path
with an image Memory path for visual processing, effectively alleviating visual
information neglect. Additionally, we introduce RoPE-DHR, a novel positional
encoding mechanism that employs thumbnail-based positional aggregation to
maintain 2D spatial awareness while mitigating remote decay in extended
sequences. Evaluations across seven benchmarks,including long-context
comprehension, multi-image reasoning, and visual question answering,
demonstrate CoMemo's superior performance compared to conventional LVLM
architectures. Project page is available at

Abstract: Modern Earth observation (EO) increasingly leverages deep learning to harness
the scale and diversity of satellite imagery across sensors and regions. While
recent foundation models have demonstrated promising generalization across EO
tasks, many remain limited by the scale, geographical coverage, and spectral
diversity of their training data, factors critical for learning globally
transferable representations. In this work, we introduce TerraFM, a scalable
self-supervised learning model that leverages globally distributed Sentinel-1
and Sentinel-2 imagery, combined with large spatial tiles and land-cover aware
sampling to enrich spatial and semantic coverage. By treating sensing
modalities as natural augmentations in our self-supervised approach, we unify
radar and optical inputs via modality-specific patch embeddings and adaptive
cross-attention fusion. Our training strategy integrates local-global
contrastive learning and introduces a dual-centering mechanism that
incorporates class-frequency-aware regularization to address long-tailed
distributions in land cover.TerraFM achieves strong generalization on both
classification and segmentation tasks, outperforming prior models on GEO-Bench
and Copernicus-Bench. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Motivation: 当前IaC生成研究仅关注语法正确性，忽略了可部署性这一关键指标，限制了实际应用价值。

Method: 提出IaCGen框架（基于LLM的迭代反馈机制）和DPIaC-Eval基准（包含153个真实场景）。

Result: 初始LLM表现差（部署成功率30%以下），但IaCGen显著提升至90%以上。用户意图对齐（25.2%）和安全性（8.4%）仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 首次全面评估可部署性为中心的IaC生成，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

*Junjie Xing,Yeye He,Mengyu Zhou,Haoyu Dong,Shi Han,Lingjiao Chen,Dongmei Zhang,Surajit Chaudhuri,H. V. Jagadish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMTU是一个大规模基准测试，包含25种现实世界表格任务的30K问题，旨在全面评估模型在专家级表格理解、推理和操作方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对表格相关任务的评估有限，主要集中在NL-to-SQL和Table-QA，忽略了专业用户面临的更广泛任务。MMTU填补了这一空白。

Method: MMTU基于数十年的计算机科学研究，设计了25种复杂表格任务，涵盖表格理解、推理和编码等技能。

Result: 前沿模型如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1在MMTU上的得分仅为60%，表明仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU为结构化数据处理和分析的基础模型发展提供了重要基准，有望推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MCMC的约束采样框架，满足约束、单调收敛和高效性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束解码方法会扭曲模型分布，影响多样性，尤其在程序模糊测试中需要多样且有效的输入。

Method: 构建有效输出的提议分布，应用Metropolis-Hastings接受准则，确保约束空间的探索。

Result: 在合成基准和实际程序模糊测试任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架同时满足约束、收敛性和高效性，适用于需要高质量约束样本的任务。

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming
visual inputs, yet their development is constrained by the costly and
labor-intensive process of data collection and system evaluation. To address
these limitations, we present a comprehensive framework with three key
contributions. First, we introduce a novel data curation pipeline that
synthesizes dialogues from annotated egocentric videos, resulting in \dataset,
a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This
work lays the foundation for developing real-time, proactive AI assistants
capable of guiding users through diverse tasks. Project page:

TL;DR: PersonaAgent是一个个性化的LLM代理框架，通过个性化记忆和动作模块，结合用户偏好优化，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理缺乏灵活性，无法满足用户多样化需求，因此开发了PersonaAgent以实现个性化任务。

Method: PersonaAgent包含个性化记忆模块（情景和语义记忆）和动作模块，通过用户偏好对齐策略优化系统提示。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaAgent在个性化动作空间和实时应用中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaAgent展示了提供动态、个性化用户体验的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本TTS中的语音印象控制方法，通过低维向量表示语音印象强度，并利用大语言模型生成目标印象向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管零样本TTS在说话人保真度上表现优异，但如何通过调控副/非语言信息来控制语音印象仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用低维向量表示语音印象对（如暗-亮）的强度，并通过大语言模型生成目标印象向量。

Result: 客观和主观评估均验证了该方法在印象控制上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从自然语言描述生成目标印象，无需人工优化。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

TL;DR: 论文研究了CTC中隐含的上下文依赖性，提出了基于知识蒸馏的上下文相关ILM估计方法，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CTC假设标签上下文独立，但现代强大编码器仍能隐式学习上下文相关的内部语言模型（ILM）。本文旨在探究CTC中ILM的隐含上下文依赖性。

Method: 提出了基于知识蒸馏（KD）的上下文相关ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法。实验在Librispeech和TED-LIUM Release 2数据集上进行。

Result: 实验结果表明，上下文相关ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文无关先验，且提出的标签级KD平滑方法显著提升了性能，词错误率相对降低超过13%。

Conclusion: CTC确实学习了上下文相关的ILM，提出的方法在跨域任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such
as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to
the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their
characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By
examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene
authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to
how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current
models. In addition, this review surveys existing evaluation metrics for
assessing realism and explores how industry professionals incorporate AI into
their workflows. The findings of this study aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the current landscape and serve as a foundation for future
research on AI-driven 3D content generation. Key findings include that advanced
generative architectures enable high-quality 3D content creation at a high
computational cost, effective multi-modal integration techniques like
cross-attention and latent space alignment facilitate text-to-3D tasks, and the
quality and diversity of training data combined with comprehensive evaluation
metrics are critical to achieving scalable, robust 3D scene generation.

TL;DR: ODE-GS结合3D高斯泼溅与隐式神经ODE，实现动态3D场景的长时预测，超越训练时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染系统（如NeRF或3DGS）依赖时间嵌入，仅擅长插值，无法预测未来时间点。ODE-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 冻结时间条件变形模型，训练Transformer编码器总结高斯轨迹，通过神经ODE控制隐状态连续演化，实现未来时间点的高斯轨迹预测。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升达10 dB，LPIPS误差减半，达到SOTA外推性能。

Conclusion: 连续时间隐动态是实现复杂3D场景逼真预测的有效且实用方法。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Motivation: 内窥镜场景中的稀疏特征和不一致光照导致现有基于运动恢复结构（SfM）的方法重建失败率高，亟需一种更可靠的重建方法以支持精确的手术导航。

Method: 提出SurGSplat，通过几何约束逐步优化3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），实现对血管结构等关键特征的详细重建。

Result: 实验表明，SurGSplat在新视角合成（NVS）和姿态估计精度上表现优异，为手术场景重建提供了高保真且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: SurGSplat通过几何约束优化3DGS，显著提升了内窥镜场景的重建质量，为手术导航提供了更可靠的视觉支持。

Abstract: Intraoperative navigation relies heavily on precise 3D reconstruction to
ensure accuracy and safety during surgical procedures. However, endoscopic
scenarios present unique challenges, including sparse features and inconsistent
lighting, which render many existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-based methods
inadequate and prone to reconstruction failure. To mitigate these constraints,
we propose SurGSplat, a novel paradigm designed to progressively refine 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) through the integration of geometric constraints. By
enabling the detailed reconstruction of vascular structures and other critical
features, SurGSplat provides surgeons with enhanced visual clarity,
facilitating precise intraoperative decision-making. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that SurGSplat achieves superior performance in both novel view
synthesis (NVS) and pose estimation accuracy, establishing it as a
high-fidelity and efficient solution for surgical scene reconstruction. More

Motivation: LLMs的部署面临知识产权侵犯和滥用的风险，尤其是模型窃取攻击。尽管水印技术被提出以缓解风险，但其实际效果和进展尚不明确。

Method: 1) 提出LLMs水印的分类法；2) 设计知识产权分类器评估水印效果；3) 分析现有水印技术的局限性；4) 讨论实际挑战和未来方向。

Result: 实验表明，尽管水印技术受到关注，但其对模型实用性和下游任务的不利影响限制了实际应用。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要开发针对LLMs部署的实用水印解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

Motivation: 现有后门防御技术通常针对单模态模型或依赖训练时的监督知识，而现实场景中无法修改冻结的视觉编码器或核心LLM参数，也无法预知未知触发器或目标响应。

Method: 提出Robust Instruction Tuning框架，仅微调解码器和文本嵌入层，结合输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化，防止模型记忆触发器-响应映射。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上对七种攻击的实验中，攻击成功率降至接近零，训练成本仅增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需修改核心权重或攻击先验的情况下，有效防御了后门攻击，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

Conclusion: QA-HFL通过设备特定正则化和智能客户端选择，有效提升性能并保持高效通信。

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法结合HGNNs和LLMs时存在嵌入空间差异和任务泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: MLM4HG将异构图转换为元路径文本序列，设计统一任务模板，并利用预训练语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在跨域和多任务实验中，MLM4HG在少样本和零样本场景下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLM4HG通过文本化和统一任务范式，显著提升了异构图的泛化学习能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基础模型计算成本高且知识广泛，但特定任务可能只需部分知识，因此需要小型专用模型。

Method: 通过任务特定转换，将大型Transformer参数映射到小型模型参数。

Result: 在图像建模任务中，生成的小型模型性能优于通用条件模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效降低计算成本并提升特定任务性能。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Transformer架构（CGT），通过将上下文编码到模型权重中，消除显式提示的需求，实现高效自适应的语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖显式提示实现特定行为，带来计算开销，CGT旨在通过动态权重更新消除这一需求。

Method: CGT模型在每个序列位置维护上下文摘要，动态更新权重，实现自适应性。

Result: 在合成上下文学习任务和语言建模基准测试中验证了有效性，并提升了上下文表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: CGT为高效、自适应语言建模提供了新方向，将上下文直接整合到模型架构中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Table-r1的两阶段程序化表格推理方法，旨在提升小语言模型在表格推理任务中的性能，解决了布局异构性和推理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格推理对小语言模型具有挑战性，程序化方法虽能解决数值推理问题，但面临布局异构性和代码生成能力不足的挑战。

Method: Table-r1采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过自监督学习任务提升布局泛化能力；第二阶段结合混合范式优化推理一致性，必要时回退到文本推理。

Result: 实验表明，Table-r1在四个基准测试中显著优于其他小语言模型方法，准确率提升至少15%，性能接近大语言模型。

Conclusion: Table-r1有效缩小了小语言模型与大语言模型在表格推理任务中的差距，为小模型的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs与人类互动形成的反馈循环如何影响信念多样性，并可能导致错误信念的固化。

Method: 使用基于代理的LLM模拟和真实GPT使用数据，形式化并测试反馈循环假说。

Result: 分析显示新GPT版本发布后多样性突然且持续下降，验证了人类-AI反馈循环的存在。

Conclusion: LLMs与人类的反馈循环可能导致信念固化和多样性丧失，需警惕其潜在负面影响。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Motivation: 自回归语言模型因固定的从左到右的标记生成方式导致错误累积，需要改进。

Method: 提出Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT)方法，通过迭代替换先前生成的文本来减少错误。

Result: 在8B参数模型上微调100B数据后，推理和编码任务的性能相对提升约10%。

Conclusion: RPT方法能有效减少错误累积，提升模型性能，且易于集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在追踪训练数据对输出的影响时，通常忽略网络不同层对信息的不同编码方式。

Method: 通过学习参数重要性权重，适应模型结构，捕捉训练数据对输出不同语义方面（如主题、风格或背景）的贡献。

Result: 方法在扩散模型中提高了归属准确性，并提供了对输出如何从训练数据中借鉴的细粒度洞察。

Conclusion: 新方法通过考虑模型结构，显著提升了数据归属的准确性和解释性。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Motivation: 传统AI开发过于依赖模型架构优化，忽视了数据质量的重要性，因此需要转向以数据为中心的开发方法。

Result: DSD在特定模型上显著提升了性能，代码和训练模型已公开。

Conclusion: 数据质量是AI性能的关键，DSD为商业AI开发提供了新标准。

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Motivation: 多标签分类中，大量未标记数据（负数据）会干扰学习过程，影响正实例的准确分类。现有方法将负数据单独分类会增加冗余和复杂性。

Method: 通过归一化加权几何平均预测类别概率，推导出类别存在的似然，并引入正则化参数控制负类别概率对正实例的影响。

Result: 在多个大规模数据集上实验，改进的损失函数显著提升了分类性能，F1、F2和平均精度分别提高了6.01、8.06和3.11个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加参数或计算复杂度的情况下，有效提升了多标签分类性能，尤其适用于负数据较多的场景。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索（NAS）中评估成本高，性能预测器通过损失函数直接估计架构性能，但现有研究未深入探讨不同损失函数的特性和效果。

Method: 将损失函数分为回归、排序和加权三类，评估了八种损失函数在13个任务和五个搜索空间中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，特定类别的损失函数组合可以提升预测器性能，并为不同任务选择损失函数提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 该研究为NAS社区提供了损失函数选择和组合的指导，有助于推动预测器方法的发展。

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性估计方法（如dropout）难以清晰区分可靠与不可靠预测，主要由于分类器权重噪声干扰了细粒度统计信息。

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，通过考虑噪声影响定义单调子集选择函数，提升置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: 方法在AUSE和AURC等风险指标上表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布差异，区分分布内外样本，并揭示CNN与ViT分类器的关键差异。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，适用于多种视觉数据集，并揭示了模型间的关键差异。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Motivation: 多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，任务梯度可能冲突，导致训练不稳定或收敛困难，需要一种有效方法调整梯度轨迹。

Method: 提出相似性感知动量梯度手术（SAM-GS），基于梯度幅度相似性度量，结合梯度均衡和一阶动量调制。

Result: 实验表明，SAM-GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中有效优化了学习过程。

Conclusion: 梯度幅度相似性对MTDL中的梯度聚合具有关键作用，SAM-GS为多任务学习提供了可扩展的优化方案。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Conclusion: SPEC提供了一种可解释且高效的嵌入比较和调整方法。

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其类脑计算和高效能耗特性受到关注，但其在图像分类和目标检测等任务中的表现不如人工神经网络（ANNs），主要原因是表达能力有限。

Method: 采用整数二进制泄漏积分发放（Integer Binary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire）和范围对齐策略（range alignment strategy），前者允许训练时整数激活并保持脉冲驱动动态，后者解决神经元无法激活高整数值的问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在ImageNet上达到74.19%准确率，在COCO上达到66.2% mAP@50和49.1% mAP@50:95，性能超越同类SNNs，并匹配或超越ANNs，同时能耗效率提升6.3倍。

Conclusion: 提出的新型脉冲神经元显著提升了SNNs的表达能力和性能，同时保持了低能耗优势，为SNNs在实际任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are noted for their brain-like computation and
energy efficiency, but their performance lags behind Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) in tasks like image classification and object detection due to the
limited representational capacity. To address this, we propose a novel spiking
neuron, Integer Binary-Range Alignment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire to
exponentially expand the information expression capacity of spiking neurons
with only a slight energy increase. This is achieved through Integer Binary
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire and range alignment strategy. The Integer Binary Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire allows integer value activation during training and
maintains spike-driven dynamics with binary conversion expands virtual
timesteps during inference. The range alignment strategy is designed to solve
the spike activation limitation problem where neurons fail to activate high
integer values. Experiments show our method outperforms previous SNNs,
achieving 74.19% accuracy on ImageNet and 66.2% mAP@50 and 49.1% mAP@50:95 on
COCO, surpassing previous bests with the same architecture by +3.45% and +1.6%
and +1.8%, respectively. Notably, our SNNs match or exceed ANNs' performance
with the same architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by
6.3${\times}$.

Motivation: 大规模注视数据收集面临数据质量和隐私问题，需要一种解决方案。

Method: 提出QualitEye，使用语义表示和隐私保护协议（如私有集合交集）验证数据质量。

Result: 在MPIIFaceGaze和GazeCapture数据集上验证性能高，隐私保护版本运行时开销小。

Conclusion: QualitEye为注视数据分析提供了新方法，结合机器学习、人机交互和密码学。

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口在老年人群中日益普遍，传统护理资源密集且成本高，亟需一种患者为中心的远程解决方案。

Method: 开发了WoundAIssist应用，采用用户中心设计，集成轻量级深度学习模型进行伤口分割，支持患者通过照片和问卷记录伤口，医生远程监控。

Result: 可用性研究显示应用易用性强，质量高，AI伤口识别功能受到好评。

Conclusion: WoundAIssist填补了患者与医疗专业人员之间的远程护理空白，并为类似数字健康工具提供了设计参考。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,
presents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,
elevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is
resource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both
patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present
WoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to
support telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly
document wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians
remain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video
consultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep
learning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with
patient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing
progression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving
both patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly
design, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with
patients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and
favorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution
is two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an
easy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap
between patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for
remote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of
interdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital
health tools across clinical domains.

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了零样本目标导航的成功率和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can
effortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup
on the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for
teaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot
action in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot
to learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within
diverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find
that understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical
clue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for
both humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow
world model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts
the future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action
planning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical
flow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect
pipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics
from these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on
language instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a
flow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and
leverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task
description. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.
Finally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an
optimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic
manipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without
hardware-specific training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过观察少量像素预测图像未观测部分，以提高图像重建的效率和质量。

Method: 提出了一种适用于实值和彩色图像的改进版ConvNADE模型，并比较了随机像素块和低差异像素块的效果。

Result: 实验表明，低差异像素块能降低测试损失并生成更真实的图像重建结果。

Conclusion: 低差异像素块在图像重建中表现更优，改进的ConvNADE模型具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织学和MSI的图像形成过程和维度不同，配准这两种模态仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用pix2pix模型从MSI合成组织学图像，实现单模态配准。

Result: 合成图像质量优于基线U-Net模型，互信息（MI）和结构相似性指数（SSIM）分别提高了+0.924和+0.419。

Conclusion: 该方法为组织学和MSI的配准提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,
compared to a baseline U-Net model. Our source code is available on GitHub:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双边多尺度信息融合网络的FPDANet，用于解决胎儿超声图像分类中的低对比度、高相似性和高噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet在胎儿超声图像分类中因缺乏上下文信息关联和单向特征传递而表现不佳。

Method: 设计了位置注意力机制（DAN）模块和双边多尺度（FPAN）信息融合模块，以增强特征表示和捕获多尺度依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别达到91.05%和100%。

Conclusion: 实验证明FPDANet在胎儿超声图像分类中具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

TL;DR: LinGuinE是一种自动化方法，用于分割肺部肿瘤的纵向CT扫描数据，通过刚性配准和点击有效性分类器提高分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动化或半自动化的纵向肿瘤分割方法，而这对放疗、手术干预和化疗反应评估至关重要。

Method: LinGuinE通过放射科医生提供的初始肿瘤位置，利用刚性配准传播采样点，并通过点击有效性分类器筛选有效点以生成新时间点的分割。

Result: 在两项测试数据集上，LinGuinE将Dice系数提高了20%以上（p<0.05），并在63项纵向研究中表现优异。

Conclusion: LinGuinE是一种有效的自动化纵向肿瘤分割方法，适用于任意起始时间点，并在实验中表现出最佳性能。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

TL;DR: DermaCon-IN是一个来自南印度门诊的前瞻性皮肤病数据集，包含5450多张临床图像，覆盖3000名患者和240种诊断，旨在解决现有数据集的临床和人口多样性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病AI模型的数据集未能充分反映真实世界的临床和人口多样性，尤其是非西方人群和肤色变化。

Method: 数据集基于Rook分类法构建，测试了多种模型架构（如ResNet、ViT等），并探索解剖学和概念线索的整合。

Result: 为皮肤病AI提供了基准性能，并展示了如何结合临床现实性设计模型。

Conclusion: DermaCon-IN为开发更具代表性和可解释性的皮肤病AI模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is poised to augment dermatological care by enabling
scalable image-based diagnostics. Yet, the development of robust and equitable
models remains hindered by datasets that fail to capture the clinical and
demographic complexity of real-world practice. This complexity stems from
region-specific disease distributions, wide variation in skin tones, and the
underrepresentation of outpatient scenarios from non-Western populations. We
introduce DermaCon-IN, a prospectively curated dermatology dataset comprising
over 5,450 clinical images from approximately 3,000 patients across outpatient
clinics in South India. Each image is annotated by board-certified
dermatologists with over 240 distinct diagnoses, structured under a
hierarchical, etiology-based taxonomy adapted from Rook's classification. The
dataset captures a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions and tonal variation
commonly seen in Indian outpatient care. We benchmark a range of architectures
including convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet),
transformer-based models (ViT, MaxViT, Swin), and Concept Bottleneck Models to
establish baseline performance and explore how anatomical and concept-level
cues may be integrated. These results are intended to guide future efforts
toward interpretable and clinically realistic models. DermaCon-IN provides a
scalable and representative foundation for advancing dermatology AI in
real-world settings.

*Yangui Fang,Jing Peng,Xu Li,Yu Xi,Chengwei Zhang,Guohui Zhong,Kai Yu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅使用文本的微调策略，用于低资源领域适应ASR，无需额外音频数据，保持语音-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低资源环境下，语音-文本配对数据稀缺时，Speech LLMs难以适应新领域的问题。

Method: 引入实时评估机制，仅使用目标领域未配对文本进行微调，保持语音-文本对齐。

Result: 在LibriSpeech、SlideSpeech和Medical数据集上表现优异，性能接近全音频-文本微调，且能提升新领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 文本微调策略在低资源领域适应中具有潜力，能避免灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ALLMs是否能作为自动评估工具，评估语音生成模型（SLMs）在说话风格控制上的表现。

Method: 使用四种SLMs完成两项任务（语音风格指令跟随和角色扮演），并通过人类和ALLMs（GPT-4o-audio和Gemini-2.5-pro）评估结果。

Result: Gemini与人类评估结果的一致性接近人类评估者之间的一致性，表明ALLMs可作为评估工具；同时发现当前SLMs在说话风格控制上仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ALLMs可作为评估SLMs说话风格的有效工具，但现有SLMs在生成自然对话和风格控制上仍需优化。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

TL;DR: CO-VADA是一种无需修改模型架构或依赖人口统计信息的去偏方法，通过语音转换生成样本以减少语音情感识别中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别系统常因说话者特征与情感标签的虚假相关性而产生偏见，现有去偏方法多需模型修改或人口统计信息，实用性受限。

Method: CO-VADA通过识别反映偏见的训练样本，应用语音转换改变无关属性生成新样本，引入与数据主导模式不同的说话者变化。

Result: 该方法兼容多种SER模型和语音转换工具，可扩展且实用，提高了SER系统的公平性。

Conclusion: CO-VADA为语音情感识别中的偏见问题提供了一种无需模型修改的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

Abstract: Precise control of neural activity -- modulating target neurons deep in the
brain while leaving nearby neurons unaffected -- is an outstanding challenge in
neuroscience, generally achieved through invasive techniques. This study
investigates the possibility of precisely and noninvasively modulating neural
activity in the high-level primate ventral visual stream via perturbations on
one's natural visual feed. When tested on macaque inferior temporal (IT) neural
populations, we found quantitative agreement between the model-predicted and
biologically realized effect: strong modulation concentrated on targeted neural
sites. We extended this to demonstrate accurate injection of
experimenter-chosen neural population patterns via subtle perturbations applied
on the background of typical natural visual feeds. These results highlight that
current machine-executable models of the ventral stream can now design
noninvasive, visually-delivered, possibly imperceptible neural interventions at
the resolution of individual neurons.
