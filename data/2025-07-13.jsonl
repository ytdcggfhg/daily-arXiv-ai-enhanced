However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop\nprincipled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."}

To address these limitations, we\npropose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to\nenhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual\nsemantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a\nchannel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,\neffectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on\npixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global\nSemantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional\nlocal features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with\nconditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent\nframes. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,\nsignificantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive\nevaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since\nour model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly\nhigher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some\nimage-based models.

Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of\nraw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as\nVec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding\ncan successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The\nunexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct\nfurther verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and\nopaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we\nreproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)\nvalidating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted\nexperiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due\nto missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.\nFurthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,\npasswords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy\ndefense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,\ncapable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear\nsemantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to\ninput sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization\ntechniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization\noffering a simpler and more widely applicable solution.

Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts.

Recently,\nMamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision\ntasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state\nscanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images\neffectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth\nlabels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater\nimages and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we\ndevelop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating\naccurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we\npropose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum\nspanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features\namong the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and\ntop-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation\ncapabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark\n(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with\nreliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for\ntraining existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate\nobject-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative\nresults and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.\nCode and dataset will be available at https://wyjgr.github.io/Tree-Mamba.html."}

First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical\ninformation, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading\ncontent, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially\nprovides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual\nerrors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent\nRetrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual\naccuracy in MLLM.

However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2).

However, in visual\nreasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and\nstatic toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,\nmulti-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and\nrefine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and\ninterpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by\nPyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.\nQuantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting\nGPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.\nThese results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just\nto use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual\nreasoning."}
