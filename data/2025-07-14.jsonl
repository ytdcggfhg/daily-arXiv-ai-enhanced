This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic).

While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA).

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight\nCCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution\nfor universal medical image segmentation.

Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model\nsizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same\ncapacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain\ntasks.

However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often\nleading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting\ntechniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to\nas 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many\nplausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between\nviewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend\ninpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when\nthere are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and\nperceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a\nreference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting\nsimilarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an\naccurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp\nthe reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the\noptimization to match the reference appearance.

OGFR adopts a teacher-student\ndistillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion\npatterns into feature representation while transferring the purified\ndiscriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch\nthrough reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware\nVision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern\nembeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding\nocclusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature\nErasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent\nis employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that\ncontain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and\nsubstitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature\ncontamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.\nAfterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch\neffectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust\nrepresentation regardless of the interference of occlusions."}

However, 7T scanners are costly,\nscarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.\nWe propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize\n7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using\n10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter\nResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter\nResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T\n(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus\nwas superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T\nincreased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely\non 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We\npropose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T\nand 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.\nOur approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical\nworkflows."}

Raptor leverages a\nfrozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual\ntokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes.
