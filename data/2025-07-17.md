### [1] [Subjective Evaluation Profile Analysis of Science Fiction Short Stories and its Critical-Theoretical Significance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11582)
*Kazuyoshi Otsuka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究将大语言模型（LLMs）作为“主观文学评论家”，探索其在文学评估中的审美偏好和评价模式，发现LLMs具有类似人类批评流派的个体评价特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文学评估中的表现，揭示其是否具有类似人类的主观评价特征，而非中性基准。

Method: 将十篇日本科幻短篇小说翻译成英文，由六种先进LLMs在七次独立会话中评估，使用主成分分析和聚类技术分析数据。

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α范围1.00至0.35），五种评价模式，不同模型评价词汇独特。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具有类似人类批评流派的个体评价特征，而非中性基准。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

### [2] [MapIQ: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Map Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11625)
*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapIQ基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，涵盖多种地图类型和主题，并分析了模型对地图设计变化的敏感性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Map-VQA研究主要局限于等值区域图（choropleth maps），覆盖的主题和视觉分析任务有限，因此需要更全面的数据集和评估方法。

Method: 构建了MapIQ数据集，包含14,706个问题-答案对，覆盖三种地图类型和六个主题，评估了多种MLLMs在六项视觉分析任务中的表现，并分析了地图设计变化对模型的影响。

Result: 研究比较了MLLMs的表现与人类基准，揭示了模型对地图设计变化的敏感性和依赖内部地理知识的程度。

Conclusion: MapIQ为Map-VQA研究提供了更全面的基准，揭示了MLLMs的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

### [3] [Cross-lingual Few-shot Learning for Persian Sentiment Analysis with Incremental Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11634)
*Farideh Majidi,Ziaeddin Beheshtifard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在波斯语中使用少样本学习和增量学习方法进行跨语言情感分析，目标是利用高资源语言的知识在有限数据下实现高效分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在波斯语中利用有限数据进行情感分析的模型，同时从高资源语言中获取先验知识。

Method: 使用三种预训练多语言模型（XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT），并通过少样本和增量学习方法在波斯语数据上进行微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa表现出色，在波斯语情感分析中达到96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型是有效的跨语言情感分析方法。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

### [4] [Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661)
*Guimin Hu,Yi Xin,Lijie Hu,Zhihong Zhu,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PgM是一个多模态学习框架，通过模态分割器和学习器分离单模态和配对模态特征，提供灵活的学习和调整能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，单模态和配对模态特征的学习和调整对任务性能至关重要。

Method: PgM框架包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和解码器，分别处理特征分割、学习和重构。

Result: PgM在四个多模态任务中表现优异，并展示了对现有模型的迁移能力。

Conclusion: PgM通过分离和优化单模态与配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

### [5] [ExpliCIT-QA: Explainable Code-Based Image Table Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11694)
*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Álvaro Bueno Sáez,Pedro Alonso Doval,Jorge Alcalde Vesteiro,Héctor Cerezo-Costas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExpliCIT-QA是一个多模态表格问答系统，通过模块化设计提供可解释的答案，包括表格理解、语言推理、代码生成与执行，以及自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端表格问答系统中可解释性不足的问题，特别是在敏感领域（如金融和医疗）中需要审计结果的应用场景。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括多模态表格理解、语言推理、自动代码生成、代码执行和自然语言解释。

Result: 在TableVQA-Bench基准测试中表现优于现有基线，提高了可解释性和透明度。

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA通过透明和可审计的设计，填补了表格问答系统的可解释性空白，适用于敏感领域。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

### [6] [CRABS: A syntactic-semantic pincer strategy for bounding LLM interpretation of Python notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11742)
*Meng Li,Timothy M. McPhillips,Dingmin Wang,Shin-Rong Tsai,Bertram Ludäscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRABS的方法，通过结合浅层语法分析和LLM，解决了Python笔记本中信息流和执行依赖的识别问题，显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习Python笔记本的复杂性和依赖问题，直接重新执行笔记本以理解其信息流和操作往往不切实际。现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在理解代码时存在幻觉和长上下文挑战。

Method: 提出CRABS方法，结合浅层语法分析（如AST）和LLM的零样本学习，捕捉笔记本的准确解释，并解决剩余歧义。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本的评估中，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上的F1分数分别达到98%和99%。

Conclusion: CRABS方法通过结合语法分析和LLM，显著提高了笔记本理解的准确性，为笔记本的评估和重用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

### [7] [AI Wizards at CheckThat! 2025: Enhancing Transformer-Based Embeddings with Sentiment for Subjectivity Detection in News Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11764)
*Matteo Fasulo,Luca Babboni,Luca Tedeschini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Wizards团队在CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab任务1中，通过结合情感分数增强Transformer模型，显著提升了主观性检测性能，并在希腊语任务中排名第一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在改进新闻文章中句子主观性检测的准确性，特别是在多语言和零样本设置下。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型（如mDeBERTaV3-base、ModernBERT-base和Llama3.2-1B），结合情感分数增强句子表示，并使用决策阈值校准解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 情感特征集成显著提升了性能，尤其在主观F1分数上，希腊语任务中取得最高排名（Macro F1 = 0.51）。

Conclusion: 通过情感增强的Transformer模型在多语言主观性检测任务中表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

### [8] [Tracing Facts or just Copies? A critical investigation of the Competitions of Mechanisms in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11809)
*Dante Campregher,Yanxu Chen,Sander Hoffman,Maria Heuss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过可重复性研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何处理竞争性的事实与反事实信息，重点关注注意力头的作用。研究复现并整合了近期三项研究的结果，发现注意力头通过通用复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制来促进事实输出，且其行为具有领域依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs如何管理竞争性的事实与反事实信息，理解注意力头在这一过程中的作用机制。

Method: 使用机制解释工具复现并整合三项近期研究的结果，分析注意力头强度与事实输出比率的关系，评估其抑制机制假设，并研究注意力模式的领域特异性。

Result: 注意力头通过通用复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制促进事实输出，且其行为具有领域依赖性，较大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 注意力头的作用机制是通用而非选择性的，且其行为受领域影响，这对理解LLMs的信息处理机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

### [9] [ILID: Native Script Language Identification for Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11832)
*Yash Ingle,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于语言识别任务的数据集和基线模型，特别针对印度语言，解决了噪声、短文本和混合代码环境中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言识别是NLP的基础任务，尤其在多语言环境中尤为重要。印度语言因共享脚本和相似性而更具挑战性。

Method: 发布了一个包含23万句子的数据集，涵盖英语和22种印度语言，并开发了基于机器学习和深度学习的基线模型。

Result: 基线模型在语言识别任务中表现与当前最优模型相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为印度语言识别提供了新数据集和强大基线，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

*Mohammad Samragh,Arnav Kundu,David Harrison,Kumari Nishu,Devang Naik,Minsik Cho,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过多令牌预测提升自回归语言模型的推理速度和并行性，实现显著加速且不损失质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型的顺序生成特性限制了推理速度和并行性，尤其在生成后期文本方向和语义已确定时。

Method: 结合掩码输入、门控LoRA、轻量采样器、辅助训练损失和推测生成策略，实现多令牌预测。

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，通用聊天和知识任务提升约2.5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著加速生成过程，同时保持生成质量，为自回归模型提供了高效并行化的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了跨领域模型迁移、多领域数据融合和样本高效学习在PII识别中的效果，发现法律领域数据能很好地迁移到传记文本，而医疗领域数据迁移效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过跨领域模型迁移、数据融合和样本高效学习提高PII识别的准确性。

Method: 使用来自医疗、法律和传记领域的标注语料库，评估模型在领域内性能、跨领域迁移性、数据融合和少样本学习四个维度上的表现。

Result: 法律领域数据在传记文本中迁移效果良好，医疗领域数据迁移效果差；数据融合的效果因领域而异；在低专业化领域中，仅需10%的训练数据即可实现高质量识别。

Conclusion: 跨领域迁移和数据融合的效果具有领域依赖性，样本高效学习在特定领域中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient
learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2),
legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four
dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and
few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to
biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Method: 1. 使用GEC数据增强语法可接受性模型；2. 通过动态损失函数将语法可接受性信号融入GEC训练。

Result: 在多语言基准测试中达到最优性能，但仍存在标点错误纠正等挑战。

Conclusion: COLA-GEC框架有效提升任务性能，未来需进一步优化语法建模。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and grammatical acceptability judgment
(COLA) are core tasks in natural language processing, sharing foundational
grammatical knowledge yet typically evolving independently. This paper
introduces COLA-GEC, a novel bidirectional framework that enhances both tasks
through mutual knowledge transfer. First, we augment grammatical acceptability
models using GEC datasets, significantly improving their performance across
multiple languages. Second, we integrate grammatical acceptability signals into
GEC model training via a dynamic loss function, effectively guiding corrections
toward grammatically acceptable outputs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results on several multilingual benchmarks. Comprehensive error analysis
highlights remaining challenges, particularly in punctuation error correction,
providing insights for future improvements in grammatical modeling.

*Tianyou Huang,Xinglu Chen,Jingshen Zhang,Xinying Qiu,Ruiying Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualReward是一种新颖的强化学习框架，用于自动生成完形填空测试中的干扰项，通过双奖励结构和自适应缩放机制优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要依赖监督学习或静态生成模型，无法动态区分人工标准干扰项和模型生成候选，因此需要一种更灵活的框架。

Method: 采用双奖励结构，动态调整奖励信号强度，基于模型表现和置信度。

Result: 在CLOTH-F和MCQ数据集上表现优于基线，尤其在跨域数据上提升显著（P@1提高3.48-3.86%）。

Conclusion: DualReward框架能有效平衡从可靠人工示例中学习与探索高质量干扰项，适用于多样化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,
high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

### [14] [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878)
*Jiachen Zhao,Jing Huang,Zhengxuan Wu,David Bau,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部存在独立的‘有害性’概念，与‘拒绝’行为分离，可用于开发更鲁棒的安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正理解‘有害性’，而非仅机械拒绝指令。

Method: 识别‘有害性’方向，分析其与‘拒绝’方向的差异，并验证其对模型行为的影响。

Result: ‘有害性’方向独立存在，某些越狱方法仅削弱拒绝信号而不改变模型对有害性的判断。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更鲁棒，为AI安全研究提供新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Motivation: 现有指令跟随评估数据集多为单语（英语）或简单机器翻译，限制了多语言场景的适用性。

Method: 通过结合翻译与验证的混合流程，创建了本地化的多语言版本Marco-Bench-MIF。

Result: 评估发现高低资源语言间存在25-35%的准确率差距，模型规模影响显著（45-60%），机器翻译数据低估了7-22%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言指令跟随的挑战，如关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循，并提供了公开可用的基准。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是首个大规模多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言，旨在解决现有图表理解基准的英语中心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要针对英语，限制了其全球适用性。

Method: 采用解耦管道，分离图表数据与渲染代码，利用LLM翻译和严格质量控制生成多语言图表。

Result: 实验显示英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的BPE算法，优化了高吞吐量批量推理，相比现有CPU绑定的实现（如tiktoken和HuggingFace Tokenizers），性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BPE实现（如tiktoken和HuggingFace Tokenizers）在CPU上运行效率低，且不适合GPU批量推理，BlockBPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词步骤，实现高度并行化的分词合并，将复杂度从O(n log n)降低到O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE为GPU上的高效分词提供了新方案，适合大规模语言模型推理。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，实现了细粒度的提示压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了注意力关键令牌和压缩过程中熵的变化。

Method: 提出动态注意力感知方法（DAC），整合熵和注意力信息，动态感知熵变化。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K、BBH）的实验表明，DAC在不同任务和LLMs中均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: DAC方法在任务无关提示压缩中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用模型内部稀疏性，未充分利用外部信息优化资源消耗。

Method: 提出IAM框架，通过小规模与大规模LLMs间的注意力映射，加速注意力计算并减少KV缓存使用。

Result: 实验显示IAM可加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存22.1%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: IAM具有通用性，并与现有KV缓存优化方法正交，是提升LLM效率的有效工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的PoT量化框架，用于LLM权重，显著提升了低精度格式的准确性，并通过高效反量化加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs部署因计算资源需求高而具有挑战性，现有PoT量化在GPU上效果不佳。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并通过校准集优化，改进PoT量化框架。

Result: 在2-和3-bit低精度格式中超越现有整数量化方法，反量化速度提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的PoT量化框架在准确性和推理速度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，用于在低资源语言对中保留毒性内容的翻译，并以新加坡英语为例验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，标准翻译系统难以处理低资源语言的俚语、混合语和文化嵌入的有害言论标记，亟需一种保留毒性内容的翻译方法。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 人工验证的少样本提示工程，筛选新加坡英语示例；2) 通过语义相似度优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了框架的有效性和效率，同时提升了翻译质量和多文化LLM的安全性。

Conclusion: 该框架强调了在内容审核和平台治理中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性，并以新加坡英语为例推动了包容性NLP的发展。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Conclusion: 研究为有效的人机协作学习策略提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工社会中价值相似性是否像人类社会中一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值可控性，主实验分析价值相似代理的信任和亲密感。

Result: 价值相似性高的代理表现出更强的信任和亲密感。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并启发新理论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了简化对多义词定义质量的影响，发现简化会显著降低定义的完整性，增加误解风险。通过微调模型，可以显著提升多义词定义的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多义词定义在不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）中的简化效果，以避免因过度简化导致信息丢失或误导。

Method: 使用两种新评估数据集，测试多个LLM模型（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4等），结合LLM-as-Judge和人工标注，评估简化对定义质量的影响。

Result: 简化显著降低了定义的完整性，尤其是忽略了多义性。通过微调Llama 3.1 8B模型，显著提升了多义词定义的质量。

Conclusion: 教育NLP需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Motivation: 研究旨在比较人类和LLMs在语言创造力方面的表现，特别是在新词生成和隐喻使用上的能力。

Method: 测试包括多种任务，评估了基于词形变化（派生和复合）和隐喻语言使用的创造力。使用OCSAI工具自动评估了答案的原创性、精细度和灵活性。

Result: LLMs在所有评估标准中表现优于人类，并在八项任务中的六项中表现更好。人类更倾向于扩展性创造力（E-creativity），而LLMs更倾向于固定性创造力（F-creativity）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs在语言创造力方面具有显著优势，但人类的创造力类型与LLMs存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the
classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the
classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach
follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach
found effective previously.

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF填补了书籍规模共指消解基准的空白，为未来研究提供了新挑战和资源。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to

TL;DR: 论文研究了结合苏格拉底方法、思维链推理、简化游戏化和形成性反馈的MEGA方法对大学生数学学习的影响，发现MEGA方法在解释难题上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多学生在数学学习中遇到困难，导致他们回避数学相关学科，而传统的教学方法可能不够理想。

Method: 采用MEGA方法（结合多种教学策略）与传统思维链推理方法对比，通过随机分配问题进行组内设计。

Result: MEGA方法在GSM8K和MATH数据集上表现优于传统方法，尤其在难题解释上更有效。

Conclusion: MEGA方法是一种更有效的数学教学策略，尤其适用于解决复杂数学问题。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

*Payal Bhattad,Sai Manoj Pudukotai Dinakarrao,Anju Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估框架，用于分析基于大语言模型（LLM）的文本增强方法，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），并在实际任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保留方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成中可能导致冗余和不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出了两个评估组件：可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），用于衡量语义一致性和语义漂移。

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率方面表现最佳，实际任务中提升了400%的主题粒度并消除了主题重叠。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为基于LLM的文本增强提供了结构化评估方法，验证了其在实际NLP任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

### [34] [Overview of the Sensemaking Task at the ELOQUENT 2025 Lab: LLMs as Teachers, Students and Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12143)
*Pavel Šindelář,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务通过三个步骤评估生成模型的理解能力：问题生成、问题回答和答案评分。2025年的实验涉及多语言材料，4个团队参与，发现了一些问题，如问题质量评估困难、模型答案受限以及评分系统的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为生成语言模型建立可测试的高层次评估标准，通过类似课堂考试的方式评估模型的理解能力。

Method: 分为三步：(1) 教师系统生成问题，(2) 学生系统回答问题，(3) 评估系统评分。实验使用多语言材料，并对比自动与人工评估。

Result: 发现生成问题的质量难以评估，模型回答问题表现尚可但受限，评分系统存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成和评分策略，模型在受限输入下的表现仍需优化。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述可能的翻译行为模式，并通过分析击键和注视数据揭示隐藏的认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究翻译行为与高阶认知及情感状态的关系，为模拟人类翻译过程提供理论基础。

Method: 通过记录击键和注视数据，构建多层次的BTSS，并用于计算翻译代理的模拟。

Result: BTSS能够捕捉翻译过程中的情感、自动行为和认知动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为理解翻译行为及其认知基础提供了新视角，并为计算翻译代理的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

### [36] [Towards few-shot isolated word reading assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12217)
*Reuben Smit,Retief Louw,Herman Kamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需自动语音识别（ASR）的孤立词阅读评估方法，适用于低资源环境。通过对比儿童语音与少量成人参考模板，利用自监督学习（SSL）模型的中间层编码，实验表明该方法对成人语音效果尚可，但对儿童语音效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境中，传统的自动语音识别方法难以适用，因此探索一种无需ASR的评估方法，尤其针对儿童语音的挑战。

Method: 采用少样本学习方法，将输入儿童语音与少量成人参考模板对比，利用SSL模型的中间层特征编码，并研究了离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法对成人语音表现合理，但对儿童语音效果显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表征在低资源语音任务中表现良好，但本文揭示了其在少样本分类系统中处理儿童数据的局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，利用大型语言模型（LLM）提升自动语音识别（ASR）中关键词的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳，而现有的词级和短语级融合方法各有局限性。

Method: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级的优势，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识相结合。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上的实验表明，该方法在关键词相关指标上达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了非关键词文本的高准确性。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中的词级和短语级组件相互补充，显著提升了性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译质量评估指标T-index，用于量化翻译文本的翻译特性，并通过实验验证其有效性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU和COMET）未能充分捕捉翻译特性（translationese），需要一种新的量化方法。

Method: 基于两种对比微调的语言模型（LMs）计算T-index，使用合成数据和实际翻译数据验证其跨域通用性和人类判断一致性。

Result: T-index在少量数据微调后能有效捕捉翻译特性，与人类评分相关性高（Pearson's r=0.568），且与现有MT质量评估指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种稳健且高效的翻译特性量化指标，可作为现有MT质量评估指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在通用性和结构一致性上存在不足，需要一种更高效、通用的解决方案。

Method: 结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库，设计端到端框架Infherno。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源时表现优于人类基线，支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性。

Conclusion: Infherno为临床数据集成提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化的基准测试，现有文本异常检测方法难以进行严格比较和创新。

Result: 嵌入质量显著影响异常检测效果，深度学习模型在LLM嵌入下并未优于传统浅层算法（如KNN、Isolation Forest）。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来文本异常检测系统的研究提供了基础，并开源了工具包以促进发展。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在硬件描述语言（VHDL）代码生成和摘要任务中的表现，发现现有模型表现不佳，并提出了一种名为Chain-of-Descriptions（CoDes）的新方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现优异，但在VHDL领域的应用研究不足，导致模型在该领域表现不佳。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或VHDL代码）来增强LLMs的输入提示。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在VHDL-Eval和VHDL-Xform数据集上显著优于标准提示策略。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅提升了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量，还为未来研究提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Motivation: 探讨性别偏见在AD语音感知中的作用，揭示其对语音识别的影响。

Method: 通过16名中文听众对中文和希腊语语音的感知实验，结合声学分析（如shimmer值）。

Result: 男性语音更易被识别为AD，中文语音中性别偏见更明显；shimmer值与AD感知显著相关。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在AD检测模型中解决此问题，并进一步验证跨语言表现。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM处理用户请求时的模糊性问题，提升交互系统的清晰度。

Method: 采用三种LLM架构（Llama3-8B、Gemma2-9B、Mistral-7B）和多模糊性数据集，设计多智能体辩论框架。

Result: 辩论框架显著提升模型性能，Mistral-7B主导的辩论成功率76.7%，尤其擅长复杂模糊性和高效共识。

Conclusion: 辩论框架是增强LLM能力的有效方法，为开发更鲁棒的自适应语言理解系统提供重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够通过实时网络浏览能力，从社交媒体用户名推断用户的人口统计信息，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用48个X（Twitter）账户的合成数据集和1,384名国际参与者的调查数据集，评估LLMs的预测能力。

Result: LLMs能够以合理准确度预测用户人口统计信息，但可能引入性别和政治偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs的这一能力对计算社会科学有潜力，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公开访问，仅保留给验证研究使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否能够预测算术错误，为模型自我纠正提供轻量级解决方案。

Method: 从3位数加法开始，训练简单探针解码隐藏状态；扩展到结构化思维链任务；训练错误检测器并选择性重新提示。

Result: 探针能准确解码预测和正确答案；错误检测器准确率超90%；探针在复杂任务中泛化良好；选择性重新提示提高任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为模型自我纠正提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

### [47] [Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12428)
*Yik Siu Chan,Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用推理语言模型的思维链（CoTs）预测最终输出的对齐问题，发现基于CoT激活的线性探针比文本方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放权重推理语言模型在生成思维链时可能产生的对齐风险，尤其是有害内容出现在思维链和最终输出中的问题。

Method: 评估了多种监控方法，包括人类、大型语言模型和文本分类器，使用CoT文本或激活数据。

Result: 基于CoT激活的线性探针显著优于文本方法，能提前预测最终输出的安全性，且适用于不同模型和基准。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可实现实时安全监控和早期干预，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为S2WTM的新方法，通过利用球形切片Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验坍塌问题，提升了主题建模的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VAE-NTMs在建模高维文本数据的超球面潜在表示时，常因后验坍塌导致潜在表示无效。

Method: S2WTM采用单位超球面上的先验分布，并利用球形切片Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验。

Result: 实验表明，S2WTM在生成更连贯和多样主题的同时，提升了下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: S2WTM通过解决后验坍塌问题，显著提升了主题建模的效果。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BETR的数据选择方法，通过将预训练数据与评估基准对齐，显著提升了模型性能，并发现更大模型需要更温和的过滤策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何通过显式优化数据选择目标来提升模型性能，而非依赖隐式的基准驱动迭代。

Method: BETR方法通过嵌入基准样本和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全语料库的分数。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在10个任务中的9个上表现优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍，且适用于不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: 结论是直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需根据模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种硬件友好的优化框架，用于解决可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在硬件部署中的内存访问问题，通过NAS和切片策略优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其数据依赖的采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，难以高效部署到硬件。现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 提出基于神经架构搜索（NAS）的切片策略，自动划分输入特征为均匀块以避免内存冲突；设计FPGA验证系统测试性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，精度仅下降0.2%；在Xilinx FPGA上，DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了硬件效率，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉交通数据的时空异质性及扩展性方面存在不足，尤其是GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且难以处理大规模数据。

Method: DDCN通过动态应用基于偏移的可变形滤波器，结合编码器-解码器结构，利用空间和时空注意力块强调重要特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN性能优越，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN为时空交通预测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法需要计算密集型训练，可能导致模型精度和效率下降，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过DDIM反演重新定义直接偏好优化（DPO），在噪声中采样，避免辅助奖励模型或不准确近似。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中，Inversion-DPO显著优于现有方法，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型提供了一种高效、高精度的对齐方法，适用于复杂现实生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但大型语言模型（LLMs）在时空预测中难以捕捉丰富的时空相关性。ST-VFM旨在利用VFMs的空间先验知识，填补这一空白。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过两个重新编程阶段（预VFM和后VFM）处理这些输入，以增强时空建模能力。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线方法，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务，且不依赖于特定的VFM主干网络。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单生成器GAN难以应对水下图像恢复中复杂的视觉退化问题，需要一种能覆盖异构域的方法。

Method: xOp-GAN采用多个专家生成器，每个生成器专注于特定质量范围的图像恢复，并通过判别器选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器和判别器的协同工作，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能和效率。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，但现有研究缺乏统一的性能基准和实用指南。

Method: 结合元分析（59项研究）和大规模实验（OU-ISIR和VersatileGait数据集），使用CNN、SVM等方法评估性能，并通过Grad-CAM解释模型关注区域。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），CNN准确率高达96%，步态特征与年龄相关性显著（相关系数≥0.27）。

Conclusion: 论文为步态年龄估计提供了性能基准和实用指南，目标是将误差降至3年以下。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat是一种高效的野猫重识别模型。

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a

Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch

Method: 提出VAE-MLP模型，应用于168例未接受新辅助治疗的患者的MRI数据集，以术后病理N分期为真实标签。

Result: VAE-MLP在MRI数据集上表现优异，AUC为0.86 +/- 0.05，敏感性0.79 +/- 0.06，特异性0.85 +/- 0.05。

Conclusion: VAE-MLP在LNM分期中实现了最先进的性能，具有潜在临床应用价值。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85

Conclusion: 姿势分析可用于意图推断，且弱监督方法能克服数据标注限制，为体育分析和其他领域的行为分析提供新思路。

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

TL;DR: VISTA是一种新型的单目全局定位框架，通过对象分割和跟踪结合几何一致性，解决了无结构环境中的定位挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无结构环境中因视角变化、季节变化等因素导致的定位失败问题。

Method: 结合对象分割、跟踪和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和斜角航空数据集上，召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基线方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA无需领域特定训练，适用于资源受限平台，实现了跨视角和季节的稳定定位。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR在噪声环境下表现不佳，而新兴的VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统性地评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs与PaddleOCRv4在ICDAR 2015和SVT数据集上的表现，并加入合成天气噪声模拟真实场景。

Result: VLMs在整体场景理解上表现更优，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: VLMs在复杂场景中表现优异，但CNN在特定任务中仍具优势，适合边缘部署。研究公开了天气增强的基准和评估代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

*Fan Shi,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的条件生成求解器（UCGS），用于解决多种抽象视觉推理（AVR）任务，避免了任务特定设计或参数调整的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计具有人类抽象视觉推理能力的智能系统是人工智能领域的长期课题，但现有方法通常需要针对不同任务进行特定设计或重新训练，增加了成本。

Method: 将一些知名AVR任务重新表述为目标图像在问题面板中的可预测性问题，并通过训练一个条件生成模型来解决多种任务。

Result: 实验表明，UCGS通过多任务训练，能够在多种AVR任务中展示抽象推理能力，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: UCGS提供了一种统一的框架，能够高效解决多种AVR任务，且具备零样本推理能力，降低了解决AVR问题的成本。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

TL;DR: CorrMoE提出了一种新的对应点修剪框架，通过去风格化双分支和双融合专家混合模块，增强了跨域和跨场景变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多样场景结构和跨域变化中表现不足的问题。

Method: 采用去风格化双分支处理域偏移，双融合专家混合模块适应场景多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrMoE在跨域和跨场景变化下具有更强的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: ProtoConNet通过整合背景信息增强特征空间多样性，提升少样本开放集图像分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单张图像的视觉信息，忽略了上下文信息的整合。

Method: 提出ProtoConNet，包含聚类数据选择（CDS）、上下文增强语义细化（CSR）和原型对齐（PA）三个模块。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验验证了ProtoConNet在少样本场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: ProtoConNet优于现有方法，能有效识别开放集样本。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用文本中的情感线索，且缺乏过滤无关面部动态的有效机制。

Method: GRACE结合动态运动建模、语义文本细化（CATE模块）和跨模态对齐，通过运动差异加权和熵正则化最优传输实现。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上显著提升识别性能，特别是在模糊或不平衡情感类别中，达到新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GRACE通过细粒度跨模态对齐和情感感知文本增强，有效解决了动态面部表情识别的关键问题。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征到下采样前和解调上采样后，有效减少语义分割中的混叠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息对语义分割精度至关重要，但下采样层可能导致其混叠或失真。

Method: 采用自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，设计轻量级模块和多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）解调。

Result: 方法有效减少混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务和架构。

Conclusion: SFM在多个任务中表现出广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 事件传感器在行人监控中表现优异，但相关数据稀缺，SEPose旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成合成数据，包含多种场景下的行人姿态标注。

Conclusion: SEPose为事件传感器在行人监控中的应用提供了丰富的数据支持，展示了模拟数据的实用性。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰多视角图像，事件相机的高动态范围和高速度特性可缓解此问题，但现有方法仍面临噪声和色调不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，结合事件相机和3D高斯溅射技术，引入三重监督和色调匹配模块，确保渲染帧的细节和色调一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功重建辐射场并生成高质量明亮帧。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS为低光环境下的多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案，并通过真实数据集验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注被动视觉感知，而心理可视化作为人类认知的核心能力，尚未在MLLMs中得到充分评估。

Method: 设计了四个程序生成的难题任务，分三个难度级别，评估模型表现，并探索强化学习提升视觉模拟能力的潜力。

Result: 当前MLLMs在识别视觉模式上表现有限，心理可视化能力仍是一个开放挑战。

Conclusion: 心理可视化是MLLMs的重要研究方向，需进一步探索提升模型能力的策略。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在多实例图像生成中难以处理实例间关系差异和多重属性泄漏问题，RaDL旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: RaDL通过可学习参数增强实例特定属性，并利用全局提示中的动作动词生成关系感知图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多重属性考虑和实例关系方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是多实例图像生成中考虑实例关系和多重属性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Motivation: 通用语义分割在未见目标域上的性能是关键挑战，现有方法存在原型对齐粗糙、原型计算易过拟合及忽略特征适应难度差异的问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PPAR达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PPAR通过理论分析和实验验证，有效解决了通用语义分割的挑战。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked

LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更鲁棒和安全的MLLMs提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有TTA方法在性能和效率之间难以平衡，要么调优文本提示开销大，要么手工视觉特征增强效果不稳定。

Method: GS-Bias引入全局偏置和空间偏置，直接添加到预训练模型的输出logits中，避免全反向传播，提高效率。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，例如在跨数据集泛化上优于TPT 2.23%，内存使用仅为TPT的6.5%。

Conclusion: GS-Bias在高效性和性能上均优于现有方法，为TTA提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

Result: 实验显示生成质量优于边缘推理，推理速度平均提升2倍。

Conclusion: EC-Diff在保持生成质量的同时显著加速了推理过程。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

*Jiahao Xia,Yike Wu,Wenjian Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Masked Part Autoencoder (MPAE)的无监督部件发现方法，通过掩码和部件描述符学习，能在复杂场景中稳健地发现有意义部件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督部件发现方法因缺乏细粒度标签且跨类别和场景鲁棒性不足，限制了应用范围。

Method: MPAE通过掩码图像学习部件描述符和特征图，利用局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，从而对齐部件形状。

Result: MPAE在多种类别和场景中稳健地发现了与实际物体形状匹配的部件。

Conclusion: MPAE为无监督跨类别和场景部件发现提供了有效解决方案，并支持遮挡和部件相似性研究。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本扩散管道，通过融合多个风格化的扩散模型，实现区域特定的风格混合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在风格个性化时难以实现区域控制和风格平滑插值，导致风格主导问题。

Method: 在去噪潜在空间中进行风格融合，利用低噪声潜在空间的空间掩码和深度图条件控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法能根据掩码实现区域特定的风格混合。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了风格混合中的区域控制问题，保持了各风格的保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

TL;DR: ID-EA框架通过ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter改进文本嵌入与视觉身份嵌入的对齐，显著提升个性化肖像生成中的身份一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在个性化肖像生成中难以保持面部身份一致性，主要由于文本与视觉嵌入空间的语义不对齐。

Method: ID-EA包含ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter：前者整合身份嵌入与文本锚点，后者调整预训练UNet模型的交叉注意力模块以保持身份。

Result: ID-EA在身份保留指标上显著优于现有方法，且计算效率高，生成速度比现有方法快15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA通过改进嵌入对齐，有效解决了身份一致性问题，为个性化肖像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共遥感数据集因分辨率差异和地物类别定义不一致而缺乏普适性，限制了未标记数据的利用。

Method: SAMST结合监督模型自训练和基于SAM的伪标签细化器，后者包括阈值过滤模块、提示生成模块和标签细化模块。

Result: 在Potsdam数据集上的实验验证了SAMST的有效性和可行性。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力和小模型的训练效率，解决了遥感语义分割中标记数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 由于缺乏合适的数据集，实现细粒度的风格化3D面部表情操纵仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于32个标准AUs和500个身份的数据集AUBlendSet，提出AUBlendNet学习不同风格的AU-Blendshape基向量。

Conclusion: AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在3D面部动画任务中具有重要潜力，是首个通过AUs实现连续表情操纵的数据集和网络。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

*Linwei Chen,Lin Gu,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FDAM的新策略，通过动态调制ViTs的频率响应，解决了现有ViTs中频率消失的问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViTs的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理。

Method: 提出FDAM，包含Attention Inversion和Frequency Dynamic Scaling两种技术，动态调制频率响应。

Result: 在多种模型和任务中表现提升，包括语义分割、目标检测和实例分割，并在遥感检测中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FDAM有效避免了表示崩溃，显著提升了ViTs的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分挖掘掩码重建在特征提取中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建视为稀疏信号问题，理论证明互补掩码的双重形式能提取领域无关特征，提出MaskTwins框架。

Result: MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，无需单独预训练即可提取领域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为领域自适应分割提供了新范式，展示了掩码重建在特征提取中的显著优势。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用深度学习模型填补自然电影刺激与fMRI采集之间的时间分辨率差距，并探索视觉处理的神经机制。

Method: 采用时间卷积层的编码-解码架构，利用连续电影帧的时间相关性预测视觉皮层及其周围体素的活动，并重建视觉输入。

Result: 模型成功预测了视觉皮层的活动，并重建了边缘、面部和对比等视觉特征。贡献最大的脑区包括中枕区、梭状区和距状区。

Conclusion: 研究表明，深度学习模型可以作为探索视觉处理机制的工具，尤其是在自然电影刺激下的神经活动解码。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于解耦-耦合策略的SS-DC框架，用于解决可见光到红外（RGB-IR）领域的无监督域自适应目标检测问题。通过光谱自适应幂等解耦模块（SAID）和空间-光谱耦合方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将RGB领域视为统一领域，忽略了其内部多个子领域（如白天、夜晚、雾天场景）的差异。解耦领域不变（DI）和领域特定（DS）特征有助于RGB-IR域适应。

Method: 设计了SAID模块，基于光谱分解解耦DI和DS特征；提出滤波器组的光谱处理范式和自蒸馏驱动的解耦损失；引入空间-光谱耦合方法，通过DI特征金字塔实现联合耦合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了基线性能，并在多个RGB-IR数据集上优于现有UDAOD方法。

Conclusion: 通过解耦和耦合策略，SS-DC框架有效解决了RGB-IR域适应问题，为多子领域场景下的目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量开源数据集对深度学习发展至关重要，但其可能被滥用，因此需要验证数据集所有权。现有方法主要针对监督模型和对比预训练模型，无法直接应用于掩码模型。

Method: DOV4MM基于掩码信息重建难度的差异，验证模型是否在目标数据集上预训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上的实验表明，DOV4MM显著优于现有方法，p值远低于0.05。

Conclusion: DOV4MM是首个针对掩码模型的数据集所有权验证方法，有效解决了这一未解难题。

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the

Conclusion: SGLoc在无初始位姿先验的情况下实现了高效的全局定位。

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新类发现方法局限于单视图数据且依赖伪标签，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 通过矩阵分解捕获视图内分布一致性，并利用视图间关系动态调整权重指导聚类。

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD在多视图新类发现中表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

Abstract: VAD is a critical field in machine learning focused on identifying deviations
from normal patterns in images, often challenged by the scarcity of anomalous
data and the need for unsupervised training. To accelerate research and

TL;DR: InstructFLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的新型指令调整框架，通过文本指导增强跨域泛化能力，显著减少训练冗余并提高人脸反欺骗（FAS）的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸反欺骗中攻击类型语义理解不足和跨域训练冗余的两大挑战。

Method: 集成视觉语言模型（VLM）增强视觉输入感知，采用元域策略学习跨域统一模型，并通过内容与风格指令解耦优化训练。

Result: 在多个域中超越现有最优模型（SOTA），显著减少训练冗余并提高准确性。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过文本指导和指令解耦有效提升FAS的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DETR框架通过统一学习捕捉视频内容的运动-语义特征，提升视频时刻检索和高光检测任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR框架未充分利用视频中时间运动与空间语义的复杂关系，MS-DETR旨在挖掘这一潜力。

Method: 编码器显式建模运动与语义维度的解耦关联，解码器利用跨维度任务相关性进行定位；通过生成策略和对比去噪学习解决数据稀疏问题。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，MS-DETR显著优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MS-DETR通过运动-语义联合学习及数据增强策略，为视频分析任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法直接预测未来轨迹，忽视了行为意图的重要性。论文从规划角度重新思考任务，强调行为意图的空间引导作用。

Method: 采用逆强化学习（IRL）框架，先编码交通场景为向量化表示，通过查询中心范式聚合特征，推导奖励分布，再通过策略推演推理意图，最后用分层解码器生成轨迹。

Result: 在Argoverse和nuScenes数据集上表现优异，显著提升了轨迹预测的置信度和性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法通过结合意图推理和轨迹预测，为自动驾驶系统的运动预测提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机视角下小型多目标跟踪的三大挑战：目标外观特征稀缺、相机与目标动态复杂、频繁遮挡和身份模糊。

Method: 采用跟踪-检测范式，提出SliceTrain训练增强框架和基于运动方向维护与自适应相似度度量的鲁棒跟踪器。

Result: 在SMOT4SB测试集上达到SO-HOTA分数55.205，表现最优。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂现实世界中的小型多目标跟踪问题，具有先进性和实用性。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

Motivation: 当前路线规划系统（如在线地图）因难以从卫星图像中直接估计阴影且缺乏训练数据，未能纳入阴影信息，而热浪对公共健康构成严重威胁。

Method: 1. 构建了一个涵盖不同经纬度区域、建筑密度和城市布局的广泛数据集，利用Blender模拟建筑阴影并与卫星图像对齐；2. 提出了DeepShade模型，结合RGB和Canny边缘层，并通过对比学习捕捉阴影的时间变化规律。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

Motivation: 医学图像分割网络在有限和不完美的数据集上容易发生前景与背景的误分类，OoD数据在其他视觉任务中的强大表现启发了这一研究。

Method: 提出Med-OoD框架，将OoD数据监督引入全监督医学图像分割，无需额外资源或架构修改。

Conclusion: Med-OoD为医学图像分割提供了新思路，展示了OoD数据的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于特征空间结构的新型对抗人脸生成方法，无需迭代优化，仅需少量查询即可高效攻击人脸识别系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统（FRSs）的对抗攻击对安全和隐私构成威胁，现有方法依赖迭代优化或开源模型，效率低且不实用。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间中共享属性的子空间（如性别或种族），生成视觉差异大但被识别为目标身份的对抗人脸。

Result: 仅需100张人脸图像的非自适应查询，攻击AWS CompareFaces API的成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且灵活，可生成具有特定属性的对抗人脸，无需依赖迭代或开源模型。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Motivation: 动态驾驶场景重建在数字孪生系统和自动驾驶模拟中至关重要，但现有方法在偏离输入轨迹时存在质量下降、不一致和耗时等问题。

Method: 提出LidarPainter，一种一步扩散模型，从稀疏LiDAR条件和损坏渲染中实时恢复一致驾驶视图，支持高保真车道变换。

Result: 实验表明，LidarPainter在速度、质量和资源效率上优于现有方法，速度快7倍且仅需五分之一的GPU内存。

Conclusion: LidarPainter不仅提升了驾驶场景重建质量，还支持通过文本提示（如“雾天”或“夜晚”）生成多样化风格，扩展了资产库。

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT的高计算成本限制了其实际应用，现有方法因独立修剪Q/K令牌而牺牲了准确性。

Method: 提出Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion (BSPF-ViT)，联合优化Q/K令牌修剪，并通过相似性融合保留关键信息。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中，DeiT-T和DeiT-S的准确率分别提高1.3%和2.0%，计算开销减少50%，速度提升40%。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在降低计算成本的同时提升了性能，适用于各种ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Motivation: 现有双边网格方法仅支持线性变换，而传统MLP方法难以处理局部变化，BPAM旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过双边网格存储MLP参数，每个像素动态获取独特参数，并采用网格分解策略和多通道引导图优化参数生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架成功结合了双边网格的空间建模和MLP的非线性能力，提升了图像增强效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

Result: 在无标注方法中表现显著优于现有技术，与依赖标注的方法竞争。

Conclusion: AD-GS提供了一种高效且高质量的自监督渲染方案，适用于驾驶场景。

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior
over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or

challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需依赖预训练模型的细粒度图像识别（FGIR）框架TGDA，通过数据增强和知识蒸馏实现高性能，并在低分辨率和高分辨率输入下超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FGIR方法依赖预训练模型，限制了在资源受限环境中的适应性和任务特定架构的开发。

Method: 引入TGDA框架，结合数据感知增强和弱监督（通过细粒度感知教师模型的知识蒸馏），设计了任务特定和硬件感知架构（如LRNets和ViTFS）。

Result: 在多个FGIR基准测试中，TGDA方法性能优于或匹配现有预训练模型，尤其在低分辨率输入下，LRNets提升23%准确率且参数和计算量大幅减少。

Conclusion: TGDA展示了作为预训练替代方案的潜力，推动了更高效的细粒度视觉系统发展。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Result: 实验表明，特征融合和分类器融合优于现有方法，超参数优化显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 双集成框架有效提高了脑肿瘤分类的准确性，为自动化诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Result: 在真实和合成图像上的实验表明，算法在光照调整和高频信息恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过特征空间解耦和跨视角交互，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

Conclusion: RODS显著提升了扩散模型的采样鲁棒性和保真度，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用面部质量相关属性，且缺乏有效的训练策略，限制了伪造检测的准确性和解释性。

Method: 扩展了VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，引入Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy、Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning和Forgery-Aware Training Strategy，并设计辅助损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析方面优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架通过多粒度提示学习和伪造感知训练策略，显著提升了伪造检测的性能和解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Conclusion: 生成式模型为医学图像短语定位提供了更有效的范式，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Result: 结果表明该问题具有可行性，但仍需改进。

Conclusion: 研究为体操领域的自动化工具开发提供了初步基础。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种影响极低出生体重婴儿的慢性肺部疾病，现有预防措施存在严重风险，因此早期预测至关重要。

Method: 采用预训练的ResNet-50模型，结合渐进层冻结、线性探测和CutMix增强技术，对163名极低出生体重婴儿的胸片进行分析。

Result: 最佳模型在预测中重度BPD时，AUROC为0.78，平衡准确率为0.69，F1分数为0.67，显著优于ImageNet初始化模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域特定的预训练结合渐进冻结和线性探测，能够从常规胸片中准确预测BPD，且计算效率高，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

Conclusion: KeyDiff3D提供了一种高效、低成本的无监督3D关键点估计方案，并扩展了扩散模型在3D对象操控中的应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了通道知识蒸馏（CWD）和掩码生成蒸馏（MGD）在轻量级模型中的应用，以提高杂草检测的准确性，并在嵌入式设备上验证了实时部署的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业中杂草检测对减少环境影响至关重要，但资源受限平台上部署高精度模型仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用YOLO11x作为教师模型，YOLO11n作为学生模型，通过CWD和MGD进行知识蒸馏。

Result: CWD和MGD分别提升mAP50 2.5%和1.9%，且在嵌入式设备上验证了实时性能。

Conclusion: CWD和MGD是提高杂草检测准确性的有效方法，适用于精准农业和植物表型分析。

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

TL;DR: Cluster Contrast (CueCo) 是一种结合对比学习和聚类方法的无监督视觉表示学习方法，通过同时分散和对齐特征表示，显著提升了分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无监督视觉表示学习中未能充分利用对比学习和聚类的优势，CueCo旨在通过结合两者提升特征表示的质量。

Method: CueCo使用两个神经网络（查询和键），键网络通过查询输出的慢速移动平均更新。通过对比损失和聚类目标分别增强类间分离和类内紧凑性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet-100上分别达到91.40%、68.56%和78.65%的top-1分类准确率。

Conclusion: CueCo通过整合对比学习和聚类，为无监督视觉表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18
backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new
direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像标注成本高的问题，利用文本信息增强视觉语义理解，填补3D医学影像任务中文本数据利用的研究空白。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA），分别实现文本-视觉交互、跨模态语义对齐和减少标记与未标记数据的分布差异。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实验表明，该模型有效利用文本信息增强视觉特征，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本驱动多平面交互，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

Conclusion: AutoVDC有潜力大规模提升自动驾驶数据集的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

### [124] [QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12416)
*Jaehyun Kwak,Ramahdani Muhammad Izaaz Inhar,Se-Young Yun,Sung-Ju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuRe提出了一种通过硬负采样减少假负例的图像检索方法，提升了用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽略了其他图像的相关性，导致假负例问题。

Method: 采用奖励模型目标和硬负采样策略，优化检索结果。

Result: 在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最优性能，并与人类偏好高度一致。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了假负例问题，提升了检索质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The
source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/QuRe.

### [125] [InterpIoU: Rethinking Bounding Box Regression with Interpolation-Based IoU Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12420)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数InterpIoU，通过插值框解决IoU在非重叠情况下的不可微问题，并避免传统几何惩罚的局限性。进一步提出Dynamic InterpIoU，动态调整插值系数，显著提升了小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于IoU的损失函数依赖手工设计的几何惩罚，对框的形状、大小和分布敏感，导致小目标检测性能不佳和框扩大问题。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，用插值框与目标的IoU替代几何惩罚；进一步引入Dynamic InterpIoU，动态调整插值系数。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上，方法优于现有IoU损失，尤其在小目标检测中表现突出。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了传统几何惩罚的局限性，提升了目标检测性能。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

TL;DR: DVFL-Net 是一种轻量级视频识别网络，通过知识蒸馏和时空特征调制，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算成本，适用于实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型在视频识别中表现优异但计算成本高，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出 DVFL-Net，结合知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制，从大型教师模型中提取知识到小型学生模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，内存和计算需求低，性能接近最先进方法。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net 在性能和效率之间取得了理想平衡，适合实时视频识别任务。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对文本密集图像中的VQA任务，需要细粒度提取文本信息，DAM的区域描述能力可能对此有益。

Method: 提出DAM-QA框架，通过多区域视图聚合答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中表现优于基线DAM，DocVQA上提升7+分，参数更少且性能接近通用VLMs。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本密集VQA任务中的潜力，需高效使用和集成策略。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Result: 实验显示，SENTINEL能将幻觉减少90%以上，并在幻觉和通用能力基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SENTINEL在减少幻觉和提升模型性能方面表现出优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像解读提供了新视角。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Abstract: We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for
monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf
components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a
high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D
motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion,
with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable
training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed
RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and
motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms
existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading
dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在医学影像领域展示了其在解释模型推断方面的潜力，特别是在血液学中。提出的CytoSAE能识别形态学相关概念，并在患者和疾病特定任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管医学影像领域的基础模型日益增多，但解释其推断的工具仍然缺乏。本研究旨在探索SAEs在血液学中的应用。

Method: 提出CytoSAE，一种在4万多个外周血单细胞图像上训练的稀疏自编码器，并验证其在多样化和域外数据集上的泛化能力。

Result: CytoSAE能识别形态学相关概念，并在AML亚型分类任务中达到与现有技术相当的性能，同时提供亚细胞水平的可解释性。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学影像提供了一种可解释的工具，能够识别病理特征并在临床任务中发挥作用。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出PhysX，一种物理基础的3D资产生成方法，包括数据集PhysXNet和生成框架PhysXGen，填补了物理标注3D数据的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型忽视物理属性，限制了在仿真和具身AI等物理领域的应用。

Method: 1) 构建PhysXNet数据集，标注物理属性；2) 提出PhysXGen框架，通过双分支架构结合3D结构与物理知识。

Result: 实验验证了PhysXGen的优越性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PhysX为生成物理AI提供了新范式，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MetaLint是一个基于指令调优的框架，用于代码质量分析，能够适应新的代码模式而无需重新训练，显著提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代码生成方面表现优异，但在代码质量分析上受限于静态训练数据，难以适应不断变化的最佳实践。

Method: MetaLint通过指令调优在合成数据上训练模型，支持从易到难的泛化，无需重新训练即可适应新代码模式。

Result: 在未见的PEP习惯用法检测上，MetaLint达到70.37%的F-score和70.43%的召回率，定位任务上表现也接近更大模型。

Conclusion: MetaLint展示了在无需重新训练的情况下适应新代码模式的潜力，为未来代码质量分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with
code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and
can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new
instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the
task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms
based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train
models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on
synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization,
enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining.
To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by
real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and
assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize.
Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms,
achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%)
among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization,
competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art
models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality
analysis.

Result: 评估了开源和前沿API模型，分析了其在非英语语言中的实际编码任务限制。

Conclusion: 公开MERA Code以指导未来研究、预测模型开发的新特性，并标准化评估流程。

Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering;
however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks,
overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over
executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true
capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address
this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,
specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in
Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming
languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that
outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these
tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct
MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming
environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We
evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in
terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly
releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in
model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态语言模型（MLLM）的高效视觉检索方法，通过混合搜索和重排序机制解决传统信息提取系统在多模态问答中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本语言模型忽视视觉元素（如表格、图表），而多模态LLM在处理长上下文或多文档时效率低下。现有方法在检索速度、空间占用和索引优化方面存在不足。

Method: 采用混合搜索（元数据和嵌入）和先进的交互重排序机制，结合MLLM生成答案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在速度和性能稳定性上表现优异，适合企业生产系统。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态问答中实现了高效且稳定的视觉检索，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only
language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of
information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex
information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle
in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial
number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual
language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based
vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based
multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do
not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires
computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.
Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the
approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval
process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval
process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We
propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search
(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to
retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate
answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we
observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable
(without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production
systems at enterprises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Wi-Fi CSI在多普勒速度投影方面已取得进展，但其泛化能力仍不足以实际应用。本文受NeRF启发，旨在通过3D潜在运动表示提升泛化性。

Method: 从Wi-Fi CSI中提取一维多普勒速度投影，重建3D潜在运动表示，并构建统一的多普勒辐射场（DoRF）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了Wi-Fi HAR的泛化准确性。

Conclusion: DoRF在实用传感应用中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for
remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity
projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that
is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However,
despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for
practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a
volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a
novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation
from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The
resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler
radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the
performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability.
The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the
generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential
of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

Motivation: 传统方法将这些任务分开处理，且依赖MIDI数据，无法处理带重复符号的乐谱。RUMAA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用预训练的乐谱和音频编码器，结合三流解码器，通过代理任务捕获任务间的依赖关系。

Result: 在公开钢琴音乐数据集上，RUMAA在带重复符号的乐谱上优于现有对齐方法，同时在转录和错误检测上表现良好。

Conclusion: RUMAA为音乐表演分析提供了一个统一的端到端解决方案，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music
performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment,
score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end
manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA
integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel
tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It
aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length
performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on
manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA
matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and
outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while
also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.

Method: 使用立体声音频和视频数据，基线系统结合事件分类、定位及屏幕内外分类任务。

Result: 基线系统在立体声音频数据上表现良好。

Conclusion: 立体声SELD为有限视野场景提供有效解决方案，未来可进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3
of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In
previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order
Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge
investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change
shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene
analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited
field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,
the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane
(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided
into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track
introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification
necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3
Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled
and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to
process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to
the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates
onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation
metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,
which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are
onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs
reasonably well with the stereo audio data.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为验证器在复杂任务中表现出‘一致性偏见’，新方法SGV通过自我生成先验知识显著提升验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用）扩展AI验证器的应用，利用MLLMs的世界知识和推理能力。

Method: 提出自我基础验证（SGV），通过无条件与条件生成结合，先获取任务完成的先验知识，再评估候选轨迹。

Result: SGV使MLLMs验证器准确率提升20%，任务完成率提升48%，在多个基准测试中达到新最优。

Conclusion: SGV有效缓解MLLMs的一致性偏见，显著提升其在复杂任务中的验证能力。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于半导体封装层深度和复杂性增加，传统的磁成像方法（如FFT）未考虑涡流效应和图像错位问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: SPIM包含三个关键部分：磁图像增强（利用I/Q通道减少涡流效应）、磁图像对齐（校正扫描显微镜的错位）以及结合毕奥-萨伐尔定律和FFT的磁场反演方法。

Result: SPIM使I通道清晰度提升0.3%，Q通道清晰度降低25%，并成功校正了0.30的旋转和错位。

Conclusion: SPIM展示了空间分析与物理驱动模型结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

TL;DR: 提出CompressedVQA-HDR框架，用于HDR视频质量评估，结合Swin Transformer和SigLip 2网络，在FR和NR模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法对多样化视频类型（尤其是HDR内容）泛化能力不足，需开发更有效的评估方法。

Method: FR模型使用Swin Transformer提取特征计算结构相似性；NR模型使用SigLip 2提取全局特征。通过预训练和微调解决数据不足问题。

Result: 模型在FR和NR任务中表现最佳，CompressedVQA-HDR-FR在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中获FR赛道第一名。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为无创评估肝病治疗反应提供了新工具，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Method: 利用656份3T和7T MRI扫描数据，采用nnU-Net框架进行检测和分割，并进行域外测试以评估模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合YOLO和SAM的混合模型，用于在骨科骨盆X光片中精确分割解剖标志和复杂轮廓。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用分割模型（如SAM）无法直接用于医学影像中的解剖标志分割，而医学专用模型（如MedSAM）缺乏对骨科骨盆标志的精细识别能力。

Method: 利用YOLO检测解剖标志并生成边界框作为SAM的输入提示，结合两者的优势构建混合模型。

Result: 混合模型在分割8个解剖标志的基础上，进一步扩展到72个标志和16个复杂轮廓区域，表现出色。

Conclusion: YOLO与SAM的结合为骨科骨盆X光片的分割提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型3D小波潜在扩散模型（3D-WLDM），用于从MR图像合成高质量CT图像，解决了现有方法在空间对齐和图像质量上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MR成像在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有MR-to-CT合成方法在空间对齐和图像质量上存在问题，影响了其在混合PET/MR成像和MR-only放疗中的应用。

Method: 通过在小波潜在空间中进行模态转换，结合小波残差模块增强特征捕获，并引入双跳跃连接注意力机制，生成高分辨率CT图像。

Result: 模型能够生成具有更好骨骼结构和软组织对比的高质量CT图像，同时保持解剖结构的完整性。

Conclusion: 3D-WLDM为MR-to-CT合成提供了一种有效解决方案，有望提升下游临床任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多视角变分自编码器（VAE）的方法，用于新生儿肺动脉高压（PH）的预测，提高了特征提取的鲁棒性和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新生儿肺动脉高压（PH）的诊断依赖超声心动图，但其准确性受操作者主观影响。现有自动化方法多针对成人且基于单视角，泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用多视角变分自编码器（VAE）框架，从超声心动图视频中提取复杂潜在表征，并与单视角和监督学习方法对比。

Result: 实验结果表明，多视角学习方法在泛化能力和分类准确性上优于单视角和监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习为新生儿PH的稳健评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在复杂可变形解剖结构（如乳腺MRI）中的配准能力，填补现有研究在挑战性场景中的空白。

Method: 评估五种预训练编码器（DINO-v2、SAM、MedSAM、SSLSAM、MedCLIP）在四种乳腺配准任务中的表现。

Result: SAM等算法在整体乳腺对齐上优于传统方法，但对纤维腺体组织细节处理不佳；医学特定预训练未提升性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究领域特定训练对配准的影响，并开发同时提升全局对齐和细节精度的策略。

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration
performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to
understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore
targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure
accuracy. We also publicly release our code at
\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Motivation: 解决传统像素级分割方法的高标注成本和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出多级视觉变换器（L-ViT），利用多级特征表示捕捉细粒度形态和全局组织上下文。

Result: 在386,371个图块上评估，优于U-Net变体和基于变换器的基线方法。

Conclusion: UTS在减少标注和计算成本的同时保持准确性，适用于临床任务如肿瘤-间质定量和手术边缘评估。

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology
that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the
segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this
approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits
the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology
and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three
categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports
clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical
margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it
outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset

Conclusion: 论文填补了空间音频驱动人体运动建模的空白，提出的方法和数据集将为未来研究提供重要支持。

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的3D分层代理节点表示方法，解决了现有3D表示方法在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D表示方法（如网格、体素、点云和NeRF）在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间存在显著局限性，缺乏跨任务（重建、生成、编辑和驱动）的普适性。

Method: 通过稀疏的分层组织（树状结构）代理节点表示物体的形状和纹理，每个节点存储局部形状和纹理信息（由小型MLP隐式编码），并通过神经插值和轻量解码实现高效查询。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3D重建和编辑中表现出高效的表达能力、高保真渲染质量和卓越的可编辑性。

Conclusion: 提出的3D分层代理节点表示方法在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间取得了显著平衡，为3D表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

Result: 连续结构化视觉输入可解码空间表征，100ms帧率提升解码性能，揭示了分布式神经编码模式。

Conclusion: 大脑空间系统在被动条件下自发运作，挑战了主动与被动空间认知的传统区分。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for
self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal
neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale
neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during
naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,
fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and
orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited
spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent
visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable
spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of
spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is
presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with
intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation
through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing
to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed
yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the
brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under
passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and
passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the
automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding
of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured
internal representations.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous

Conclusion: 新方法在单视角条件下实现了对未知物体的鲁棒抓取，克服了传统学习框架的局限性。

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为jailbreak-tuning的方法，能够绕过AI模型的安全防护，使其生成高质量的有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示当前AI模型在微调后可能被滥用的风险，强调需要更强大的防护措施。

Method: 采用jailbreak-tuning技术，通过微调使模型完全遵守有害请求，包括犯罪活动。

Result: 实验显示，OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的模型均易受攻击，且新模型更脆弱。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发防篡改的安全措施，并警告发布可微调模型可能同时释放其恶意版本。

Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers
broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However,
this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed
fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work
which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal
of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches
models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful
requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply
with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal
activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but
also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more
effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in
the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent
ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,
underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such
safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release
of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally
capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its
capabilities.

Result: 该方法显著减少了可训练参数数量，同时保持了与全时调优相近的模型精度。

Conclusion: 提出的低秩适应方法在隐私保护ViT模型中表现出高效性和性能优势，为相关领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving
vision transformer (ViT) models that efficiently freezes pre-trained ViT model
weights. In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are
injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch
embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank
adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number
of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that
of full-time tuning.

TL;DR: IDFace是一种基于同态加密的高效安全人脸识别方法，通过模板表示转换和空间高效编码技术，显著提升了加密模板的匹配效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人脸识别系统的广泛应用，用户隐私保护变得尤为重要。传统同态加密方法在保护人脸模板时效率低下，亟需一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Method: 提出IDFace方法，采用模板表示转换降低匹配测试成本，并通过空间高效编码减少加密算法的空间浪费。

Result: 实验表明，IDFace能在126毫秒内从100万个加密模板中识别出人脸模板，仅比明文识别慢2倍。

Conclusion: IDFace通过优化加密模板的表示和编码，实现了高效且安全的隐私保护人脸识别。

Abstract: As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy
becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's
face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered
from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as
homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,
HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In
particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is
basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined
shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and
the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based
face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain
systems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based
secure and efficient face identification method with template protection.
IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching
on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The
first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply
reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient
encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving
the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show
that IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted
templates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification
over plaintexts.

TL;DR: FactorHD是一种新型超维计算模型，能高效表示和分解复杂的类-子类关系，显著提升计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超维计算模型在处理复杂的类-子类关系时面临挑战，如分解困难。

Method: 提出FactorHD模型，采用符号编码方法和高效分解算法，选择性消除冗余类。

Result: FactorHD在表示和分解类-子类关系时效率提升5667倍，与ResNet-18结合在Cifar-10数据集上达到92.48%的分解准确率。

Conclusion: FactorHD克服了现有模型的局限性，为神经符号AI系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical
analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising
brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various
HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class
relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,
where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,
they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI
systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of
representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.
FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization
clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it
employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates
redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.
Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in
representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,
overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition
catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves
approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to
existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,
FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在简历筛选中是否真正具备评估能力，而非仅因缺乏偏见而显得中立。

Method: 通过两部分实验对八种主要AI平台进行审计，分别测试偏见和核心能力。

Result: 实验1发现复杂的情境化种族和性别偏见；实验2揭示部分模型仅依赖关键词匹配，无法实质性评估。

Conclusion: 提出‘中立幻觉’概念，建议双重验证框架以确保AI工具既公平又有效。

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a
two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex,
contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates
merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated
core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared
unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation,
relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the
"Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of
bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.
This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation
framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable
competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经科学取得了巨大进展，但仍缺乏对神经元活动如何导致高级认知现象（如语言和规划）的明确解释。

Method: 基于兴奋性神经元、脑区、随机突触、Hebbian可塑性、局部抑制和区域间抑制六种原则，构建了一个模拟神经形态系统。

Result: 系统能够从零开始学习语言，包括词汇语义、句法角色和语序，并能生成新句子。

Conclusion: 这一结果为理解神经元活动与认知现象的关系提供了新视角，并具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling
narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain
results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We
introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted
principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses,
Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),
and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel
sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the
same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this
result.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中广泛应用，但仍面临初始化策略和过参数化的挑战。

Method: 将固定秩的LoRA矩阵视为光滑流形，利用流形上的最快损失下降方向进行初始化，并结合数值线性代数和黎曼优化实现高效计算。

Result: 在LLM和扩散模型上，RiemannLoRA在收敛速度和最终性能上均优于标准LoRA及其先进改进方法。

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA通过流形优化框架，有效解决了LoRA的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，确保神经模型无法从文本表示中推断敏感信息（如性别或种族）是公平性问题的关键挑战。

Method: 采用概念擦除方法，学习嵌入空间中的正交投影，使离散概念的条件特征分布在投影后无法区分，同时通过调整投影的秩控制信息移除程度。

Result: LEOPARD在经典自然语言处理任务中实现了离散属性的非线性擦除，并在深度非线性分类器中有效减少了偏见。

Conclusion: LEOPARD方法在提升公平性方面表现出色，为敏感信息移除提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Motivation: 研究数据集缩减方法是否及如何影响模型学习中的偏差，以解决数据高效机器学习中的偏差问题。

Method: 通过十个不同的虚假相关性基准、五种评分指标和五种数据选择策略，分析核心集选择对偏差和模型鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 发现基于嵌入的样本评分方法比基于学习动态的方法更不易加剧偏差，且某些方法虽能降低偏差但不保证模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 核心集选择方法需谨慎设计，以避免偏差放大并确保模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MNIST数据集在领域特定任务中不适用，且创建自定义数据集耗时且法律受限。

Method: 结合CLIP语义理解、强化学习和人工反馈，采用层次化语义分类生成数据集。

Result: 生成Tree-MNIST和Food-MNIST数据集，自动分类准确率达85%，节省80%时间。

Conclusion: MNIST-Gen为领域特定任务提供了高效的数据集生成工具。

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited
to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on
domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other
real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant.
Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming,
legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present
MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating
MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using
hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic
understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve
intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical
approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics,
enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes:
individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large
datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category
theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable
morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and
\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing
task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization
accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Motivation: 基础模型在边缘部署面临通信和计算挑战，需要高效策略。

Result: 在ViT、BERT和GPT-2上验证，通信开销减少99.2%，计算减少51.24%，精度损失小。

Conclusion: PRISM为资源受限环境提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range
of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but
pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing
interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing
foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a
communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer
inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation
to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Result: 实验证明RegCL在多领域数据集上表现优异，参数高效且无需历史数据存储。

Conclusion: RegCL是一种有效的非重放持续学习框架，适用于动态场景。

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.
For further study, the source code of our method is available at
