However, existing\nMMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting\npre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in\noutdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow\nrange of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations\nreduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal\ntasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video\nand audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text\nKnowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive\nmultimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,\nwhere each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed\ndescriptions of concepts.

Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning.

RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders).

To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel\nstructure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex\nparadigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships\ncritical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text\ninduces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,\ndirecting models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing\nattention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question\nanswering performance across diverse document types without requiring\narchitectural modifications or additional training."}

While these\nperturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they\ncan actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data\naugmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on\nclassical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical\nmachine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in\nprinciple, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential\napplications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation\napproach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy\nand discuss the implications of this limitation."}

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical.

Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically\nsensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or\nideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset\nspanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question\ntypes. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,\nwhile Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and\nquery language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM\nbehavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM\ndeployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts."}

In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition.

In this\nstudy, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications\nto the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have\nhierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation\nmore difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is\nknown to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into\nthe objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents\nemploying random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy."}

To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a\nnovel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing\nprojection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable\nprojections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.\nSubsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product\nmatrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike\nalternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our\nmethod matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.\nExperimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable\nhard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the\nperformance margin scales well with the number of tokens."}

To\naddress this question, we introduce the \\textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context\n(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to\nobjects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different\nperturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,\ndepending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the\nlevel of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high\ntarget-scene congruence or when objects are degraded.

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions.

Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR\ndata into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many\nestablished methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image\ndetail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize\nthe global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR\nshutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the\nsensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the\nsensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.\nThe exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization\nproblem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many\nsensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest\nsaturation (1%).
