Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical\nfrequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily\nlossy.

ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually\nlabeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To\ndemonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three\ndifferent detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to\nimages. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with\nthe best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts.

Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision\nTransformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as\nexplicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous\nSSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region\ncharacterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include\nmulti-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,\naugmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target\nvariable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We\nshow that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model\nmatches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's\nability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.\nOur geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous\nregions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic\nsettings.

Earlier methods rely on dense\nBEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse\nquery-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries\nand can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,\nwe propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic\nqueries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to\nsequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to\nencourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence\ninformation, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked\nreconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an\ninformative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space\nlearned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and\nsplit operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries\nthroughout the network.

Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,\nDySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the\nart.

To enhance point-wise appearance representation,\nwe design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,\nallowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors.

To address\nthese limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been\nintensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual\nknowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that\nrefining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically\nconsistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.\nDespite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the\nfollowing challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of\nmultiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and\nredundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to\nmine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with\nstructural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional\ndistribution learning.

Establishing a robust theoretical\nfoundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore\nbecome an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable\ndirections have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image\ndenoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks\nstill lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural\ncomponents that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and\nsubsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by\ndeveloping a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not\nonly the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such\nas positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later\nvariants.

However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive\nencoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,\nespecially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,\nwe introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),\nwhich adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying\nsizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable\nquantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.\nDespite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,\nDART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that\nuniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a\nmore efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior\nperformance.

Conventional methods\nface challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high\ncomputational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method\nremains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local\nregions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion\nmodel framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,\nwe first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of\nhistorical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically\nconsistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the\ngeneration phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are\nutilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating\naccurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct\nobservational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns\nlearned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible\nreconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,\nmulti-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization\ncapability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and\nconduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The\nresults of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on\nreconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical\nclassification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'\ntopical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a\ndiverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its\nability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields.

Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce\nexcessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),\nand introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize\nthe definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a\nModel-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal\nInference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a\nweight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,\nattention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level\nSelf-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a\nMultimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.\nTo tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate\nlabel and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and\nfine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD\ngeneralization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also\nintroduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD\nscenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

After\ndetecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto\ncorresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects\nacross the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection\nprocess but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and\ncomplex aircraft exteriors.

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization\nremain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced\nmathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,\nespecially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background\nknowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for\nautomating such evaluation.

In this work, we take a step toward addressing this\ngap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization\ntasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded\nensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical\npreservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and\nformal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for\ndifferent contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as\na proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal\nmathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM\njudges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating\nwith human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing\nformal qualities.

We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that\ndemonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief\nupdates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief\nalignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be\nmade more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u5ff5\u65f6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u51b2\u7a81\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u590d\u6742\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aLLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise\nin the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many\nreal-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical\nmanifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry\nwithin hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties\nare lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures\nwith directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing\nangular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that\nthis approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of\nhyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative\nmodels. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face\ndatasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the\nunderlying hyperspherical manifold.

The measured point cloud is registered with the\nreference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three\nhierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error\nanalysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the\nreference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these\npatches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based\nprimitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point\nclouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine\nthe coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on\ncircular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a\ntwo-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,\nedge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures.

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our\nPTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different\nbit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods.

Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to\naccurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve\nprofessional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely\non vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,\nwe introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer\ncompositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol\nmodel, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification\ndetailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content\nand style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model\nthen synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground\nlayers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design\ngeneration and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches\nand proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a\ncopyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs.

Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss\nwhich use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text\noffset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is\nsimilar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of\nwords is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the\noffset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM\nmethods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between\nimage offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality\ndegrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by\nthe offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform\nan empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image\noffset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.\nOur important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is\ncorrelated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset\nmisalignment.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention\nwhile maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive\nexperiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate\nthat GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective\nunlearning.

To access a\nfull global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or\neye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing\nenvironment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control\nand observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have\ndiscussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.\nIn a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary\nsignificantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects\nof environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image\nshot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the\ncamera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches\nfor the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this\nalgorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is\nunreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy\navailable for moving the camera.

Specifically, we achieve\nreal-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the\nmatrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU\nreadings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption\nreduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides\ndiverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for\naccurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in\nreal time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS\nmatrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based\nmodel. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU\nreadings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method.

The method approximates the\nposterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses\nthis to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for\nexponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the\nmethod is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing\nbaselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion\nmodels, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the\nlatent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We\ndemonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within\nindividual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the\ndiffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the\nlatent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of\ndiffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase\ntransitions.

Previous methods can be broadly\nclassified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,\nTransformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of\nthem has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or\nthe computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.\nRecently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a\npromising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range\nmodeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have\nalso adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive\nperformance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the\nVision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring\nthe potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical\nimage segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure\nRWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates\nImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical\nimage segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first\npure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a\nlarge-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets\ndemonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation\nperformance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from\nscratch.

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system\nwith gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We\ndevelop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings\nand train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We\naccomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a\n360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports\nrendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze\non top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the\nhand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye\nobservations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct\naction predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks\ntowards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements\na foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small\ncompute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable\nfixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.\nWe evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring\nmanipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm.
