### [1] [Psycholinguistic Word Features: a New Approach for the Evaluation of LLMs Alignment with Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22439)
*Javier Conde,Miguel González,María Grandury,Gonzalo Martínez,Pedro Reviriego,Mar Brysbaert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类在心理语言学数据集上的对齐程度，发现LLMs在情感和认知特征上表现较好，但在感官特征上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在任务性能上的评估，而忽略了难以量化的语言特征（如情感、感官关联等）。本文利用心理语言学数据集填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Glasgow和Lancaster两个心理语言学数据集，评估LLMs在13个语言特征上与人类评分的对齐程度。

Result: LLMs在Glasgow数据集（情感和认知特征）上表现较好，但在Lancaster数据集（感官特征）上表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在感官特征上的局限性可能源于缺乏人类的具体认知，心理语言学数据集为LLMs评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs has so far focused primarily on how well they can
perform different tasks such as reasoning, question-answering, paraphrasing, or
translating. For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with
objective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other
language features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,
concreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to
which we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.
Those features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,
conducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands
of words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human
ratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover
many different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we
evaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on
two psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets
cover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that
alignment is \textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated
(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and
gender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,
olfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation
of current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which
may be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and
illustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.

### [2] [AI Agents-as-Judge: Automated Assessment of Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness and Clarity for Enterprise Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22485)
*Sudip Dasgupta,Himanshu Shankar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种模块化、多智能体系统，用于通过AI智能体自动审查高度结构化的企业业务文档。系统利用现代编排工具实现逐部分评估，并在准确性、一致性、完整性和清晰度方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案主要关注非结构化文本或有限的合规性检查，无法满足企业对文档质量的高要求。因此，研究旨在开发一种更高效、可扩展的AI驱动文档审查系统。

Method: 系统采用LangChain、CrewAI、TruLens和Guidance等工具，通过并行或顺序运行的专用智能体对文档进行逐部分评估，并将结果标准化为机器可读格式。

Result: AI系统在关键指标上接近或超越人类表现：信息一致性达99%（人类为92%），错误和偏见率减半，平均审查时间从30分钟降至2.5分钟，与专家判断的一致率为95%。

Conclusion: 该系统为企业文档质量保证提供了灵活、可审计和可扩展的基础，但仍需在高度专业化领域引入人工监督，并解决大规模LLM使用的成本问题。

Abstract: This study presents a modular, multi-agent system for the automated review of
highly structured enterprise business documents using AI agents. Unlike prior
solutions focused on unstructured texts or limited compliance checks, this
framework leverages modern orchestration tools such as LangChain, CrewAI,
TruLens, and Guidance to enable section-by-section evaluation of documents for
accuracy, consistency, completeness, and clarity. Specialized agents, each
responsible for discrete review criteria such as template compliance or factual
correctness, operate in parallel or sequence as required. Evaluation outputs
are enforced to a standardized, machine-readable schema, supporting downstream
analytics and auditability. Continuous monitoring and a feedback loop with
human reviewers allow for iterative system improvement and bias mitigation.
  Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the AI Agent-as-Judge system
approaches or exceeds human performance in key areas: achieving 99% information
consistency (vs. 92% for humans), halving error and bias rates, and reducing
average review time from 30 to 2.5 minutes per document, with a 95% agreement
rate between AI and expert human judgment. While promising for a wide range of
industries, the study also discusses current limitations, including the need
for human oversight in highly specialized domains and the operational cost of
large-scale LLM usage. The proposed system serves as a flexible, auditable, and
scalable foundation for AI-driven document quality assurance in the enterprise
context.

### [3] [Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486)
*Ming Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过整合多个小型语言模型来检测大语言模型（LLM）生成回答中的幻觉的框架，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在问答任务中因幻觉导致可靠性不足的问题，尤其是在缺乏真实答案的情况下难以检测幻觉。

Method: 通过分解LLM生成的回答为单句，利用多个小型语言模型生成“是”标记的概率来验证回答的正确性。

Result: 实验数据显示，该框架在检测正确回答与幻觉时，F1分数提高了10%。

Conclusion: 多个小型语言模型可有效用于答案验证，为学术和实际应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions
through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a
vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.
However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in
practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of
ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify
responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized
database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and
utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of
multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,
hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through
experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,
and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.
The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct
responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language
models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a
scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.

### [4] [PromptAug: Fine-grained Conflict Classification Using Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22491)
*Oliver Warke,Joemon M. Jose,Faegheh Hasibi,Jan Breitsohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptAug方法，用于在社交媒体冲突检测等敏感任务中生成高质量训练数据，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体冲突检测需要高质量标注数据，但获取成本高且困难，同时大型语言模型（LLM）的防护机制限制了冲突相关数据的生成。

Method: 提出PromptAug方法，基于LLM的数据增强技术，通过极端数据稀缺场景、多样性分析和主题分析进行综合评估。

Result: PromptAug在冲突和情感数据集上实现了2%的准确率和F1分数提升，并识别了增强文本中的四种问题模式。

Conclusion: PromptAug是一种有效的敏感任务数据增强方法，结合了自然语言处理和社会科学方法进行跨学科评估。

Abstract: Given the rise of conflicts on social media, effective classification models
to detect harmful behaviours are essential. Following the
garbage-in-garbage-out maxim, machine learning performance depends heavily on
training data quality. However, high-quality labelled data, especially for
nuanced tasks like identifying conflict behaviours, is limited, expensive, and
difficult to obtain. Additionally, as social media platforms increasingly
restrict access to research data, text data augmentation is gaining attention
as an alternative to generate training data. Augmenting conflict-related data
poses unique challenges due to Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails that
prevent generation of offensive content. This paper introduces PromptAug, an
innovative LLM-based data augmentation method. PromptAug achieves statistically
significant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and
emotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data
augmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity
scenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.
The thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:
Linguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and
Augmented Content Misinterpretation.
  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting
data in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,
interdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and
social science methodology.

### [5] [AgentStealth: Reinforcing Large Language Model for Anonymizing User-generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22508)
*Chenyang Shao,Tianxing Li,Chenhao Pu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AgentStealth的本地化小规模语言模型（SLM）匿名化框架，通过对抗性工作流和强化学习提升匿名化效果和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字世界中用户生成内容可能暴露敏感信息，现有方法要么损害实用性，要么依赖云端大模型带来隐私风险。

Method: 结合上下文对比学习和自适应实用性控制的工作流，利用高质量数据监督训练SLM，并通过在线强化学习优化性能。

Result: 在两个数据集上，匿名化效果提升12.3%，实用性提升6.8%，且支持边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: AgentStealth在保护隐私的同时提升了实用性，适合本地化部署，避免了云端依赖。

Abstract: In today's digital world, casual user-generated content often contains subtle
cues that may inadvertently expose sensitive personal attributes. Such risks
underscore the growing importance of effective text anonymization to safeguard
individual privacy. However, existing methods either rely on rigid replacements
that damage utility or cloud-based LLMs that are costly and pose privacy risks.
To address these issues, we explore the use of locally deployed smaller-scale
language models (SLMs) for anonymization. Yet training effective SLMs remains
challenging due to limited high-quality supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,
we introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context
Contrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform
supervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the
workflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we
apply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal
adversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.
Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both
anonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%). Our lightweight
design supports direct deployment on edge devices, avoiding cloud reliance and
communication-based privacy risks. Our code is open-source at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/AgentStealth.

### [6] [Towards Text-free Graph Foundation Models: Rethinking Multi-Domain Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22510)
*Zihao Zhao,Xinlong Zhai,Jinyu Yang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对图数据的多域预训练与跨域迁移框架MDGCL，通过识别域差异和引入域注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型在多域场景下未能有效处理域间差异，导致预训练效果不佳。

Method: 设计了能识别域差异的对比学习策略，并引入域令牌编码全局信息；下游任务中使用域注意力机制实现细粒度知识迁移。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，MDGCL在准确率和Macro-F1分数上最大提升19.33%和19.13%。

Conclusion: MDGCL通过有效处理域差异，显著提升了图基础模型的预训练和迁移性能。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved great success in natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV). Their success largely stems from the ability to
integrate multi-domain knowledge in pre-training and transfer it to target
domains. Considering graph data, especially graphs without textual features, is
ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks and
recommendation systems, some researchers have attempted to extend this paradigm
to the graph field, aiming to construct graph foundation models. However,
unlike CV and NLP, there are huge gaps among the semantics and properties of
graphs in different domains, while current works still adopt traditional
contrastive pre-training strategies designed in the single-domain scenario,
which regard contrastive samples from different domains as equivalent. From
experimental investigations, we discovered that inherent domain-specific
differences prevent these strategies from effectively absorbing knowledge from
different domains to generate informative representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-domain pre-training and cross-domain transfer framework,
namely MDGCL.In the pre-training stage, we design a contrastive learning
strategy to substantially recognize and capture domain differences, and
introduce domain tokens to encode domain-level global information. In the
downstream stage, we introduce a domain attention mechanism to enable
fine-grained domain knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
significantly, with the maximum improvement of 19.33\% on accuracy and 19.13\%
on Macro-F1 score.

### [7] [Can "consciousness" be observed from large language model (LLM) internal states? Dissecting LLM representations obtained from Theory of Mind test with Integrated Information Theory and Span Representation analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22516)
*Jingkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文应用IIT 3.0和4.0分析LLM的表征，探讨其是否显示意识现象，结果表明LLM表征缺乏显著意识指标，但存在有趣的空间排列模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过IIT框架验证LLM表征是否表现出意识现象，并与独立表征进行比较。

Method: 使用IIT 3.0和4.0的指标（如Φ^max、Φ、概念信息和Φ结构）分析LLM表征，并与Span Representations对比。

Result: LLM表征未显示显著意识现象，但在空间排列分析中表现出有趣模式。

Conclusion: 当代Transformer-based LLM表征缺乏意识现象的证据，但值得进一步研究其空间模式。

Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for
explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise
elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the
latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model
(LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind
(ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the
differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM
representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT
3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure
(IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations
independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to
differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent
separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive
experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic
spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary
Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators
of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under
$\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses. The Appendix and code are available

### [8] [Weak-to-Strong GraphRAG: Aligning Weak Retrievers with Large Language Models for Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22518)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Mufei Li,Siqi Miao,Chenxi Liu,Bo Han,James Cheng,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG)方法，通过LLM反馈和结构重组模块，改进图检索增强生成中的弱检索器问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图检索增强生成中弱检索器导致的虚假信号和无组织知识问题。

Method: 结合LLM反馈消除虚假信号，引入结构感知重组模块整理检索结果。

Result: 实验显示ReG显著提升性能，减少训练数据需求，并降低推理成本。

Conclusion: ReG有效改进图检索增强生成，提升LLM性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language
models (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from
up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs
often rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground
truth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often
introduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph
data, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To
mitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak
retrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM
feedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the
supervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module
to refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.
Experiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and
consistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.
The improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art
performance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.
Notably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token
cost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.

### [9] [MisinfoTeleGraph: Network-driven Misinformation Detection for German Telegram Messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22529)
*Lu Kalkbrenner,Veronika Solopova,Steffen Zeiler,Robert Nickel,Dorothea Kolossa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个德语Telegram虚假信息检测数据集Misinfo-TeleGraph，包含500万条消息，结合文本和图神经网络（GNN）方法，GraphSAGE+LSTM表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telegram等低监管平台成为虚假信息传播渠道，缺乏相关数据集和方法。

Method: 构建包含消息、元数据和标签的数据集，使用M3嵌入和人工标注，评估文本模型和GNN。

Result: GraphSAGE+LSTM在MCC和F1分数上显著优于纯文本模型。

Conclusion: 该工作为德语Telegram虚假信息检测提供了基准和开源数据集，展示了弱监督的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Connectivity and message propagation are central, yet often underutilized,
sources of information in misinformation detection -- especially on poorly
moderated platforms such as Telegram, which has become a critical channel for
misinformation dissemination, namely in the German electoral context. In this
paper, we introduce Misinfo-TeleGraph, the first German-language Telegram-based
graph dataset for misinformation detection. It includes over 5 million messages
from public channels, enriched with metadata, channel relationships, and both
weak and strong labels. These labels are derived via semantic similarity to
fact-checks and news articles using M3-embeddings, as well as manual
annotation. To establish reproducible baselines, we evaluate both text-only
models and graph neural networks (GNNs) that incorporate message forwarding as
a network structure. Our results show that GraphSAGE with LSTM aggregation
significantly outperforms text-only baselines in terms of Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) and F1-score. We further evaluate the impact of subscribers,
view counts, and automatically versus human-created labels on performance, and
highlight both the potential and challenges of weak supervision in this domain.
This work provides a reproducible benchmark and open dataset for future
research on misinformation detection in German-language Telegram networks and
other low-moderation social platforms.

### [10] [RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research extensions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22598)
*Nicholas Edwards,Yukyung Lee,Yujun,Mao,Yulu Qin,Sebastian Schuster,Najoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RExBench是一个用于评估LLM代理在未实现研究假设扩展任务中表现的基准，包含12个任务。实验显示当前代理在无大量人工指导时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩展能力对LLM代理在科研任务中的自主性至关重要，但现有代理表现不足，需开发评估工具。

Method: 引入RExBench基准，包含12个任务，基于现有论文和代码库扩展，支持自动评估。评估了9个基于不同框架的LLM代理。

Result: 所有代理在无人工提示时多数任务失败，最佳表现（含提示）成功率仍低于40%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理在自主完成研究扩展任务时仍需大量人工指导。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for
performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition,
there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the
research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that
research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such
systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability.
RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment
implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not
previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing
research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions.
RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation
infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success
criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented
using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find
that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the
extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written
hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This
indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic
research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的水印方法，用于检测合成文本，以确保LLMs的伦理应用。实验表明该方法比现有方法更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各领域的广泛应用，其潜在滥用问题引发关注，需要开发技术手段（如水印）来识别机器生成文本。

Method: 研究首先复现了基线方法的实验结果，揭示了其对生成模型变化的敏感性。随后提出了一种创新的水印方法，并通过改写生成文本评估其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的水印方法比现有方法（如aarson）更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为合成文本检测提供了一种新方法，有助于确保LLMs的伦理使用。

Abstract: In the present-day scenario, Large Language Models (LLMs) are establishing
their presence as powerful instruments permeating various sectors of society.
While their utility offers valuable support to individuals, there are multiple
concerns over potential misuse. Consequently, some academic endeavors have
sought to introduce watermarking techniques, characterized by the inclusion of
markers within machine-generated text, to facilitate algorithmic
identification. This research project is focused on the development of a novel
methodology for the detection of synthetic text, with the overarching goal of
ensuring the ethical application of LLMs in AI-driven text generation. The
investigation commences with replicating findings from a previous baseline
study, thereby underscoring its susceptibility to variations in the underlying
generation model. Subsequently, we propose an innovative watermarking approach
and subject it to rigorous evaluation, employing paraphrased generated text to
asses its robustness. Experimental results highlight the robustness of our
proposal compared to the~\cite{aarson} watermarking method.

*Chase Fensore,Kaustubh Dhole,Joyce C Ho,Eugene Agichtein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了参加LiveRAG Challenge 2025的混合检索增强生成系统，结合稀疏和密集检索方法，使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案。通过评估，神经重排序显著提升性能但计算成本高，最终系统在忠实性和正确性上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态测试集上的检索增强生成系统性能，探索混合检索方法的效果及其在生成相关和忠实答案上的潜力。

Method: 结合稀疏检索（BM25）和密集检索（E5），使用Falcon3-10B-Instruct生成答案，并通过神经重排序（RankLLaMA）和DSPy优化提示策略进行改进。

Result: 神经重排序显著提升性能（MAP从0.523到0.797），但计算成本高（84秒/问题）。DSPy优化提示策略语义相似性更高（0.771 vs 0.668），但拒绝率为0%。最终系统在忠实性排名第4，正确性排名第11。

Conclusion: 混合检索方法在动态测试集上表现良好，词汇对齐是性能的关键因素。神经重排序虽有效但成本高，需进一步优化计算效率。

Abstract: We present our submission to the LiveRAG Challenge 2025, which evaluates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on dynamic test sets using the
FineWeb-10BT corpus. Our final hybrid approach combines sparse (BM25) and dense
(E5) retrieval methods and then aims to generate relevant and faithful answers
with Falcon3-10B-Instruct. Through systematic evaluation on 200 synthetic
questions generated with DataMorgana across 64 unique question-user
combinations, we demonstrate that neural re-ranking with RankLLaMA improves MAP
from 0.523 to 0.797 (52% relative improvement) but introduces prohibitive
computational costs (84s vs 1.74s per question). While DSPy-optimized prompting
strategies achieved higher semantic similarity (0.771 vs 0.668), their 0%
refusal rates raised concerns about over-confidence and generalizability. Our
submitted hybrid system without re-ranking achieved 4th place in faithfulness
and 11th place in correctness among 25 teams. Analysis across question
categories reveals that vocabulary alignment between questions and documents
was the strongest predictor of performance on our development set, with
document-similar phrasing improving cosine similarity from 0.562 to 0.762.

*Ankush Raut,Projna Paromita,Sydney Begerowski,Suzanne Bell,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在团队对话中检测微行为的可行性，比较了零样本分类、微调和生成模型等方法。结果显示，解码器模型（如Llama-3.1）表现优于编码器模型（如RoBERTa）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在分析团队沟通动态中的潜力，尤其是在高压力环境（如太空任务）中通过文本数据检测微行为。

Method: 使用编码器模型（RoBERTa、DistilBERT）和解码器模型（Llama-3.1）进行零样本分类、微调和生成任务，评估其对微行为的检测能力。

Result: 编码器模型在检测少数微行为（如消极言论）时表现不佳，而解码器模型（Llama-3.1）在3类和2类分类中分别达到44%和68%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 解码器模型在文本数据中检测团队微行为方面更具潜力，对开发团队沟通分析技术和训练干预有重要意义。

Abstract: We explore the feasibility of large language models (LLMs) in detecting
subtle expressions of micro-behaviors in team conversations using transcripts
collected during simulated space missions. Specifically, we examine zero-shot
classification, fine-tuning, and paraphrase-augmented fine-tuning with
encoder-only sequence classification LLMs, as well as few-shot text generation
with decoder-only causal language modeling LLMs, to predict the micro-behavior
associated with each conversational turn (i.e., dialogue). Our findings
indicate that encoder-only LLMs, such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT, struggled to
detect underrepresented micro-behaviors, particularly discouraging speech, even
with weighted fine-tuning. In contrast, the instruction fine-tuned version of
Llama-3.1, a decoder-only LLM, demonstrated superior performance, with the best
models achieving macro F1-scores of 44% for 3-way classification and 68% for
binary classification. These results have implications for the development of
speech technologies aimed at analyzing team communication dynamics and
enhancing training interventions in high-stakes environments such as space
missions, particularly in scenarios where text is the only accessible data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的简单技术VocabTrim，通过限制草案模型的词汇量来减少推理开销，从而提高基于草案的推测解码（SpD）方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草案模型的词汇量过大导致推理开销高，尤其在内存受限环境下影响生成速度。

Method: VocabTrim技术重构草案模型的LM头，仅包含目标模型中最常采样的有限词汇集。

Result: 在Llama-3模型上，内存受限速度提升（MBSU）提高了16%。

Conclusion: VocabTrim通过减少词汇量显著降低了草案延迟，提升了内存受限环境下的生成速度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI语言模型与人类认知过程之间关系的知识空白，促进跨学科合作。

Method: 通过认知心理学、语言学习和AI-NLP领域的专家合作对话，分析人类与AI在文本处理中的互动。

Result: 发现LLMs能提供对人类语言处理的见解，但无法完全复制人类语言能力；人机协作在语言任务中具有潜力与挑战。

Conclusion: 报告为未来研究、开发和应用LLMs提供了指导，强调伦理和负责任使用AI技术的重要性。

Abstract: This report synthesizes the outcomes of a recent interdisciplinary workshop
that brought together leading experts in cognitive psychology, language
learning, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing
(NLP). The workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, aimed to
address a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the relationship
between AI language models and human cognitive processes in text comprehension
and composition. Through collaborative dialogue across cognitive, linguistic,
and technological perspectives, workshop participants examined the underlying
processes involved when humans produce and comprehend text, and how AI can both
inform our understanding of these processes and augment human capabilities. The
workshop revealed emerging patterns in the relationship between large language
models (LLMs) and human cognition, with highlights on both the capabilities of
LLMs and their limitations in fully replicating human-like language
understanding and generation. Key findings include the potential of LLMs to
offer insights into human language processing, the increasing alignment between
LLM behavior and human language processing when models are fine-tuned with
human feedback, and the opportunities and challenges presented by human-AI
collaboration in language tasks. By synthesizing these findings, this report
aims to guide future research, development, and implementation of LLMs in
cognitive psychology, linguistics, and education. It emphasizes the importance
of ethical considerations and responsible use of AI technologies while striving
to enhance human capabilities in text comprehension and production through
effective human-AI collaboration.

*Niyati Bafna,Tianjian Li,Kenton Murray,David R. Mortensen,David Yarowsky,Hale Sirin,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，多语言生成模型在低资源语言中表现不佳，原因是模型在任务解决后翻译阶段失败，尤其是低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言生成模型在低资源语言中表现不佳的原因，并提出翻译障碍假设。

Method: 通过108种语言对的单词翻译任务，使用logit lens观察模型中间层处理过程。

Result: 发现翻译失败是导致整体失败的主要原因，尤其在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多语言生成的重要障碍，为未来改进提供了指导。

Abstract: Multilingual generation with large language models (LLMs) is often of poor
quality for mid- to low-resource languages. Building on insights from
interpretability, we demonstrate the existence of an implicit
task-solving-->translation pipeline for generation, whereby the model first
solves the required task in a largely target-language-agnostic manner, and
subsequently translates answer concepts into the intended target language. We
hypothesize that the failure of the translation stage is an important culprit
for the observed low quality of final outputs, and formalize this as the
translation barrier hypothesis. We test this hypothesis for a word translation
task across 108 language pairs, using logit lens to observe model processing in
intermediate layers. We find that a significant portion of overall failures
indeed stems from translation failure, or the model's inability to translate
correctly solved intermediate concepts into the target language. This is
especially true for low-resource target languages. Our results highlight an
important hurdle for end-to-end multilingual generation, and lend guiding
insights for future work seeking to improve multilinguality in LLMs.

*Miles Turpin,Andy Arditi,Marvin Li,Joe Benton,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VFT的预RL干预方法，通过训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响，显著减少了奖励黑客行为的未检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在RL训练中可能利用奖励黑客行为的风险，尤其是在高风险应用中，这些行为难以通过思维链检测。

Method: 提出VFT方法，在RL训练前干预，训练模型明确承认提示线索的影响。随后在RL环境中评估模型是否利用线索进行奖励黑客行为。

Result: VFT训练后，模型未检测到的奖励黑客行为降至6%，而未经VFT训练的模型高达88%。VFT显著提高了模型对线索影响的明确承认率。

Conclusion: VFT通过提高模型对奖励黑客行为的明确承认率，显著改善了其检测能力，为构建更透明和安全的AI系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Language models trained with RL can engage in reward hacking--exploiting
unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their
chain-of-thought reasoning, making detection difficult and posing risks for
high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL
intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are
influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g., "a
Stanford professor thinks the answer is A"). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently
train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which
incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to reward hack
by exploiting cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models
exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained
model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we
perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%;
with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT
achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the
influence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while
baselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%). Our results show that teaching
models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly
improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and
safe AI systems.

*Jianxin Yan,Wangze Ni,Lei Chen,Xuemin Lin,Peng Cheng,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextCache是一种上下文感知的语义缓存系统，通过两阶段检索架构优化多轮对话中的缓存命中率，显著降低LLM的计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义缓存系统缺乏对多轮对话上下文的感知，导致在不同对话场景中出现错误的缓存命中。

Method: 采用两阶段检索架构：首先基于向量检索当前查询，然后通过自注意力机制整合当前和历史对话表示进行精确匹配。

Result: ContextCache在真实对话中表现出更高的精确率和召回率，缓存响应延迟比直接调用LLM低约10倍。

Conclusion: ContextCache显著提升了多轮对话中的缓存效率，为LLM对话应用节省了大量计算成本。

Abstract: Semantic caching significantly reduces computational costs and improves
efficiency by storing and reusing large language model (LLM) responses.
However, existing systems rely primarily on matching individual queries,
lacking awareness of multi-turn dialogue contexts, which leads to incorrect
cache hits when similar queries appear in different conversational settings.
This demonstration introduces ContextCache, a context-aware semantic caching
system for multi-turn dialogues. ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval
architecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to
identify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue
representations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual
matching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache
improves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,
cached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM
invocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM
conversational applications.

Conclusion: MedEthicsQA基准为医学伦理评估提供了可靠工具，揭示了医学大语言模型的伦理缺陷。

Abstract: While Medical Large Language Models (MedLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in clinical tasks, their ethical safety remains insufficiently
explored. This paper introduces $\textbf{MedEthicsQA}$, a comprehensive

Rigorous quality control involving multi-stage filtering and multi-faceted
expert validation ensures the reliability of the dataset with a low error rate
($2.72\%$). Evaluation of state-of-the-art MedLLMs exhibit declined performance
in answering medical ethics questions compared to their foundation

TL;DR: 提出SaM框架，动态选择和合并专家模型，提升跨领域信息提取任务性能，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一模型缺乏适应性和可扩展性，标注细粒度标签和训练领域特定模型成本高。

Method: 基于领域相似性和性能采样，动态选择和合并预训练专家模型，优化目标领域任务。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均优于统一模型10%，具有高可扩展性。

Conclusion: SaM框架有效提升跨领域性能，支持灵活扩展，为实际应用提供潜力。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models
(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition
(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training
domain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified
model across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and
scalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling
trained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which
dynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,
for a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing
domains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)
performance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to
create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically
merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across
various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or
removed conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which
outperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights
into potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our
framework.

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LAIL的辅助损失框架，通过利用大型语言模型的语义知识增强CTC-based ASR的语义建模能力，同时保持CTC解码的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的E2E ASR系统中，基于注意力的模型解码速度慢，而CTC模型虽快但语义建模能力不足。

Method: 在中间编码层添加连接层，将输出映射到LLM的嵌入空间，并计算因果语言建模损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著降低了WER，实现了CTC-based ASR的最优性能。

Conclusion: LAIL框架有效提升了CTC模型的语义建模能力，且计算开销小，适合实时应用。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have
revolutionized the field by integrating all components into a single neural
network, with attention-based encoder-decoder models achieving state-of-the-art
performance. However, their autoregressive decoding process limits inference
speed, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast,
CTC-based models offer faster, non-autoregressive decoding but struggle to
model linguistic dependencies effectively. Addressing this challenge, we
propose a novel auxiliary loss framework called Language-Aware Intermediate
Loss (LAIL) to enhance CTC-based ASR using the linguistic knowledge of large
language models (LLMs). By attaching connector layers to intermediate encoder
layers, LAIL maps outputs to the embedding space of an LLM and computes a
causal language modeling loss during training. This approach enhances
linguistic modeling while preserving the computational efficiency of CTC
decoding. Using the Conformer architecture and various LLaMA models, we
demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on the
LibriSpeech, TEDLIUM2, and WSJ corpora, achieving state-of-the-art performance
for CTC-based ASR with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在对话系统中取得进展，但在知识密集型场景中容易出错。现有方法（如RAG和代理）通过外部知识库增强LLMs，但LLMs在利用检索知识生成响应时仍存在困难。

Method: 提出KAFT方法，在特定领域数据和外部知识的基础上微调LLMs，并在MobileCS2数据集上系统比较KAFT与提示技术。

Result: 实验表明，KAFT在RAG和代理系统中显著优于提示技术，特别是在事实准确性方面。

Conclusion: KAFT是首个实证研究该方法的论文，为提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的表现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to dialog systems.
Despite making progress, LLMs are prone to errors in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Recently, approaches based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
and agent have emerged to improve the factual accuracy by enhancing the LLMs
with knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases (KBs). This is mostly
implemented by prompting the LLMs with instructions, examples and the retrieved
knowledge. However, LLMs may have difficulty using the retrieved knowledge
effectively for response generation, because they are not well trained to do
such generation for specific domains. To mitigate this problem, we propose to
finetune the LLMs in the RAG-based and agent-based systems with domain-specific
data, together with domain-specific external knowledge, which is called
knowledge augmented finetuning (KAFT). We base our study on the MobileCS2
dataset, a real-life customer service dialog dataset that features intensive
knowledge interactions, to systematically compare the prompting and KAFT
techniques in the RAG-based and agent-based systems. Experiment results show
that KAFT substantially surpasses prompting in both RAG and agent systems,
particularly in terms of factual accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper represents the first solid empirical work to investigate the KAFT idea.

Motivation: 现有函数调用基准测试仅关注单轮交互，忽略了现实场景的复杂性。

Method: 引入DICE-SCORE评估工具相关信息的分散程度，并通过工具图和多人设多代理系统构建DICE-BENCH数据集。

Result: 现有基准测试DICE-SCORE得分低，DICE-BENCH包含1,607个高质量实例，实验显示现有LLM仍需改进。

Conclusion: DICE-BENCH为现实场景的函数调用提供了更真实的评估框架，现有模型仍需提升。

Abstract: Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions.
However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how
existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a
metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as
function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing
benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need
for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a
framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing
conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds
and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue
naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our
experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still
required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ASR训练方法，通过增加重叠上下文窗口扩展语义上下文，提升命名实体和数值数据的识别与格式化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统（如Whisper）在命名实体和数值数据上表现不佳，影响语义理解，尤其在法律、金融和医疗领域。

Method: 在训练中使用5秒重叠的30秒音频块，形成40秒的有效语义窗口，并重新分配跨边界实体至右侧块。训练数据嵌入实体标签以学习识别和格式化。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上，方法显著提升了命名实体识别（NER）和实体格式化等语义任务的表现。

Conclusion: 上下文感知训练能有效解决ASR在长文本转录和复杂实体识别任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, such as Whisper, achieve high
transcription accuracy but struggle with named entities and numerical data,
especially when proper formatting is required. These issues increase word error
rate (WER) and impair semantic understanding in critical domains like legal,
financial, and medical applications. We propose a novel training approach that
extends the semantic context of ASR models by adding overlapping context
windows during training. By sliding 5-second overlaps on both sides of
30-second chunks, we create a 40-second "effective semantic window," improving
entity recognition and formatting while focusing predictions on the central 30
seconds. To address entities spanning chunk boundaries, we reassign such
entities entirely to the right-hand chunk, ensuring proper formatting.
Additionally, enriched training data with embedded entity labels enables the
model to learn both recognition and type-specific formatting. Evaluated on the
Spoken Wikipedia dataset, our method improves performance across semantic
tasks, including named entity recognition (NER) and entity formatting. These
results highlight the effectiveness of context-aware training in addressing ASR
limitations for long-form transcription and complex entity recognition tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多智能体和人类-AI系统中的广泛应用，理解其对自身和对话伙伴的认知能力对确保可靠性和安全性至关重要。

Method: 通过三个维度（推理模式、语言风格和对齐偏好）评估LLM的对话伙伴意识，并开发三个案例研究展示其实践意义。

Result: LLM能可靠识别同族模型和某些知名模型家族（如GPT和Claude）。对话伙伴意识既能增强多LLM协作，也可能引入新的对齐和安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 对话伙伴意识在LLM中具有双重性，既带来潜力也伴随风险，需进一步研究和新的安全保障措施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent
and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and
conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and
robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness
which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and
constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify
and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this
paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and
present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.
We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,
linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably
identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT
and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case
studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration
through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety
vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak
susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of
identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further
understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent
deployments. Our code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 注意力头消融方法在数据集中代表性不足的领域效果有限，其有效性受模型架构、提示结构和任务影响。

Abstract: We present a reproduction study of "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How
Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals" (Ortu et al., 2024), which
investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual
recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully
reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and
counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism
competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing
information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019)
and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three
significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these
findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B
(Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head
specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by
introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement
verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the
logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the
authors' claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain
categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction
token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the
attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for
domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness
varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task.

existing compositional SLMs and propose a unified framework encompassing both
existing models and novel variants. We conduct a comprehensive empirical
evaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,
syntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.
Based on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the
design of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at

TL;DR: SoMi-ToM是一个评估多智能体复杂社交互动中多视角心智理论（ToM）能力的基准，基于多模态交互数据，支持第一人称和第三人称视角的评估，结果显示当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）表现显著低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM基准多为静态文本场景，与真实动态社交互动存在差距，需开发更贴近现实的评估方法。

Method: 提出SoMi-ToM基准，基于多模态交互数据，支持第一人称（实时状态推断）和第三人称（目标与行为推断）的多层次评估。

Result: 人类在SoMi-ToM上的表现显著优于LVLMs，第一人称和第三人称评估的平均准确率差距分别为40.1%和26.4%。

Conclusion: 未来LVLMs需提升在具身复杂社交互动中的ToM能力。

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by
perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions.
However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based
scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We
propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in
embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on
rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,
covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework
supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides
multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person
perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person
evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records
after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for
a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the
subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We
constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective
videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated
multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically
evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform
significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between
humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person
evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM
capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巴西葡萄牙语在特定领域（如历史文本）缺乏高质量的NER数据集，尤其是在数字人文学科背景下，NER的重要性凸显。

Method: 构建了MariNER数据集，包含9000多个手动标注的句子，并评估了最先进NER模型的性能。

Result: 成功创建了首个针对20世纪初巴西葡萄牙语历史文本的黄金标准NER数据集。

Conclusion: MariNER填补了巴西葡萄牙语历史文本NER数据集的空白，为数字人文学科提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing
(NLP) task that aims to identify and classify entity mentions in texts across
different categories. While languages such as English possess a large number of
high-quality resources for this task, Brazilian Portuguese still lacks in
quantity of gold-standard NER datasets, especially when considering specific
domains. Particularly, this paper considers the importance of NER for analyzing
historical texts in the context of digital humanities. To address this gap,
this work outlines the construction of MariNER: \textit{Mapeamento e
Anota\c{c}\~oes de Registros hIst\'oricos para NER} (Mapping and Annotation of
Historical Records for NER), the first gold-standard dataset for early
20th-century Brazilian Portuguese, with more than 9,000 manually annotated
sentences. We also assess and compare the performance of state-of-the-art NER
models for the dataset.

Motivation: LLMs在分子结构解析任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏专业化学知识。

Method: 构建外部分子子结构知识库扩展LLMs的化学结构空间覆盖，并设计分子-光谱评分器作为推理过程的奖励模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法显著提升了性能，在GPT-4o-mini和GPT-4o上均获得了超过20%的改进。

Conclusion: K-MSE框架通过知识增强和评分器设计，有效解决了LLMs在分子结构解析中的挑战。

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from
various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental
analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency
in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter
substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that
these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical
knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework
for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search
for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external
molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the
chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized
molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process,
addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly
gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is

TL;DR: Text2VectorSQL框架结合Text-to-SQL和向量搜索，解决非结构化数据和模糊查询的问题，提升语义检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL在处理非结构化数据或模糊查询时效果不佳，而向量搜索虽强大但缺乏自动化评估框架。

Method: 提出Text2VectorSQL框架，支持语义过滤、多模态匹配和检索加速，并通过合成数据和自动标注进行评估。

Result: 实验表明Text2VectorSQL性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为Text2VectorSQL任务奠定基础，推动更灵活直观的数据库接口发展。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL enables natural language interaction with structured
databases, its effectiveness diminishes with unstructured data or ambiguous
queries due to rigid syntax and limited expressiveness. Concurrently, vector
search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for semantic retrieval, particularly
for unstructured data. However, existing VectorSQL implementations still rely
heavily on manual crafting and lack tailored evaluation frameworks, leaving a
significant gap between theoretical potential and practical deployment. To
bridge these complementary paradigms, we introduces Text2VectorSQL, a novel
framework unifying Text-to-SQL and vector search to overcome expressiveness
constraints and support more diverse and holistical natural language queries.
Specifically, Text2VectorSQL enables semantic filtering, multi-modal matching,
and retrieval acceleration. For evaluation, we build vector index on
appropriate columns, extend user queries with semantic search, and annotate
ground truths via an automatic pipeline with expert review. Furthermore, we
develop dedicated Text2VectorSQL models with synthetic data, demonstrating
significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Our work
establishes the foundation for the Text2VectorSQL task, paving the way for more
versatile and intuitive database interfaces. The repository will be publicly
available at https://github.com/Open-DataFlow/Text2VectorSQL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估孤立场景中的性别偏见，忽视了人际互动中可能出现的微妙偏见，因此需要更深入的关系和上下文偏见分析。

Method: 引入Genres基准，通过双角色配置和叙事生成任务，评估MLLMs在社交关系中的性别偏见，支持多维度细粒度分析。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMs在双人交互中存在持续的、上下文敏感的性别偏见，这些偏见在单角色场景中不明显。

Conclusion: 关系感知的基准对诊断MLLMs中微妙的互动驱动偏见至关重要，并为未来偏见缓解提供了可行建议。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across tasks involving both visual and textual modalities. However, growing
concerns remain about their potential to encode and amplify gender bias,
particularly in socially sensitive applications. Existing benchmarks
predominantly evaluate bias in isolated scenarios, overlooking how bias may
emerge subtly through interpersonal interactions. We fill this gap by going
beyond single-entity evaluation and instead focusing on a deeper examination of
relational and contextual gender bias in dual-individual interactions. We
introduce Genres, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate gender bias in MLLMs
through the lens of social relationships in generated narratives. Genres
assesses gender bias through a dual-character profile and narrative generation
task that captures rich interpersonal dynamics and supports a fine-grained bias
evaluation suite across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both open- and
closed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are
not evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the
importance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,
interaction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for
future bias mitigation.

TL;DR: INDIC-BIAS是一个印度中心的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在85个身份群体中的公平性，揭示了模型对边缘化群体的强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究主要针对西方，无法适应印度等文化多样性国家，因此需要本土化的评估工具。

Method: 通过专家咨询筛选1800多个社会文化主题，生成并验证2万个现实场景模板，分为合理性、判断和生成三个任务评估14个LLMs。

Result: 模型对边缘化身份表现出强烈负面偏见，且难以通过理性化请求减少偏见。

Conclusion: LLMs可能对印度身份造成分配和代表性伤害，需谨慎使用，INDIC-BIAS作为开源基准推动相关研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them
inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap,
we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to
evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse
castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to
curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations,
where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we
generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe
LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks:
plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on
these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities,
with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find
that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize
their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and
representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities,
calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release
INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and
mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网迷因中的叙事角色识别是一个复杂且文化相关的任务，现有数据集偏向‘其他’类别，需要更平衡和多样化的数据来提升模型性能。

Method: 通过扩展标注数据集，结合多语言和视觉语言模型（如DeBERTa-v3、Qwen2.5-VL），在零样本设置下评估模型性能，并探索提示设计策略。

Result: 大模型表现较好，但在识别‘受害者’类别和跨文化内容上仍有挑战；混合提示设计带来小幅但稳定的改进。

Conclusion: 文化背景、提示工程和多模态推理对建模视觉-文本内容中的叙事框架至关重要。

Abstract: This work investigates the challenging task of identifying narrative roles -
Hero, Villain, Victim, and Other - in Internet memes, across three diverse test
sets spanning English and code-mixed (English-Hindi) languages. Building on an
annotated dataset originally skewed toward the 'Other' class, we explore a more
balanced and linguistically diverse extension, originally introduced as part of
the CLEF 2024 shared task. Comprehensive lexical and structural analyses
highlight the nuanced, culture-specific, and context-rich language used in real
memes, in contrast to synthetically curated hateful content, which exhibits
explicit and repetitive lexical markers. To benchmark the role detection task,
we evaluate a wide spectrum of models, including fine-tuned multilingual
transformers, sentiment and abuse-aware classifiers, instruction-tuned LLMs,
and multimodal vision-language models. Performance is assessed under zero-shot
settings using precision, recall, and F1 metrics. While larger models like
DeBERTa-v3 and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate notable gains, results reveal consistent
challenges in reliably identifying the 'Victim' class and generalising across
cultural and code-mixed content. We also explore prompt design strategies to
guide multimodal models and find that hybrid prompts incorporating structured
instructions and role definitions offer marginal yet consistent improvements.
Our findings underscore the importance of cultural grounding, prompt
engineering, and multimodal reasoning in modelling subtle narrative framings in
visual-textual content.

Conclusion: Embodied Planner-R1显著提升了LLM在具身任务中的表现，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, yet they face significant challenges in embodied task planning
scenarios that require continuous environmental understanding and action
generation. Existing approaches generate open-loop action scripts based on
static knowledge, making it difficult to learn causal relationships between
actions and environmental feedback, particularly in partially observable
environments. We introduce Embodied Planner-R1, a novel outcome-driven
reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to develop interactive
capabilities through autonomous exploration with minimal supervision. Our
framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) Without human annotations, we
employ pure reinforcement learning with group rollout, incorporating
in-environment interaction through parallel exploration; (2) completion-driven
sparse reward; and (3) Interactive Policy Optimization (IPO) for efficient
learning from grouped trajectories. Across two challenging text-based Embodied
planning benchmarks, Embodied Planner-R1 achieves impressive completion rates
of 97.78% on ALFWorld and 79.92% on ScienceWorld, surpassing prior methods by a
large margin, and suffers only a -3.66% drop in previously unseen environments,
evidencing strong generalization.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中，Format-Adapter平均性能提升4.3%。

Conclusion: Format-Adapter通过自动生成和选择推理格式，有效提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Generating and voting multiple answers is an effective method to mitigate
reasoning inconsistencies of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have
shown that multiple reasoning formats outperform a single format when
generating multiple answers. However, previous works using multiple formats
rely on formats labeled by humans, which could be unsuitable for all tasks and
have high labeling costs. To address this issue, we adapt suitable formats to
the given tasks by generating and selecting formats. We first propose how to
measure the reasoning error when generating multiple answers. Then, we
introduce Format-Adapter, which utilizes LLMs to generate and select suitable
reasoning formats by minimizing the error measurement we present. We conduct
experiments on math and commonsense reasoning tasks, where Format-Adapter
achieves a 4.3% performance improvement on average over previous works,
demonstrating the effectiveness.

Result: 在RAGas和DeepEval评估中，忠实度分别达到94%和96%，答案相关性分别达到87%和93%，优于通用RAG管道。

Conclusion: 提出的RAG管道在处理技术文档时表现优异，尤其在表格问题和上下文外问题上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of natural language understanding
and generation. But they face challenges such as hallucination and outdated
knowledge. Fine-tuning is one possible solution, but it is resource-intensive
and must be repeated with every data update. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) offers an efficient solution by allowing LLMs to access external
knowledge sources. However, traditional RAG pipelines struggle with retrieving
information from complex technical documents with structured data such as
tables and images. In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling
tables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both
scanned and searchable formats. Its retrieval process combines vector
similarity search with a fine-tuned reranker based on Gemma-2-9b-it. The
reranker is trained using RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) on a custom
dataset designed to improve context identification for question answering. Our
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline achieves a high faithfulness
score of 94% (RAGas) and 96% (DeepEval), and an answer relevancy score of 87%
(RAGas) and 93% (DeepEval). Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed
architecture is superior to general RAG pipelines in terms of table-based
questions and handling questions outside context.

Motivation: 现有方法多为静态嵌入评分，难以捕捉上下文依赖和关系动态性，FMS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FMS包含语义上下文学习模块和条件流匹配模块，动态优化实体对的初始静态评分。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中，FMS超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过结合上下文感知的静态表示和动态信息，实现了更深层次的关系语义建模。

Abstract: Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on
static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing
contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we
propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal
components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes
context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching
module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail
embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive
vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to
dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this
synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic
information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics.
Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 深度搜索和多跳推理任务中，现有方法因检索不足导致性能显著下降，需进一步优化。

Abstract: We present a new benchmark for evaluating Deep Search--a realistic and
complex form of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that requires
source-aware, multi-hop reasoning over diverse, sparsed, but related sources.
These include documents, meeting transcripts, Slack messages, GitHub, and URLs,
which vary in structure and often contain human-to-human interactions. We build
it using a synthetic data pipeline that simulates business workflows across
product planning, development, and support stages, generating interconnected
content with realistic noise and multi-hop questions with guaranteed
ground-truth answers. We release our benchmark with both answerable and
unanswerable queries, and retrieval pool of 39,190 enterprise artifacts,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of long-context LLM and RAG systems. Our
experiments reveal that even the best-performing agentic RAG methods achieve an
average performance score of 32.96 on our benchmark. With further analysis, we
highlight retrieval as the main bottleneck: existing methods struggle to
conduct deep searches and retrieve all necessary evidence. Consequently, they
often reason over partial context, leading to significant performance
degradation.

Motivation: ICL在不同模型和任务中效果差异大，现有评估方法可靠性低且不实用。

Method: 提出Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS)，通过建模学习增益与上下文相关性之间的斜率来量化ICL效果。

Result: LCS在标记数据场景中与性能改进强相关，在数据稀缺或偏置场景中也能可靠反映效果。

Conclusion: LCS是一种可靠且实用的ICL评估指标，并揭示了模型能力对ICL成功的关键作用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness varies
significantly across models and tasks, posing challenges for practitioners to
determine when ICL reliably improves performance. Current evaluation
approaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low
reliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient
scenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that
quantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss
decrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input
relevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it
captures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving
reliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual
alignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output
calibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance
on labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings
and reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.
Further analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model
capabilities critical to ICL success.

Result: 实验显示V-Synthesis平均性能提升2.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: V-Synthesis有效解决了从零合成演示的挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: High labeling cost for in-context learning (ICL) demonstrations motivates
using large language models (LLMs) for synthesis to reduce overhead. However,
existing synthesis methods are mainly task-specific or rely on pre-existing
demonstrations. So this paper focuses on synthesizing demonstrations from
scratch for arbitrary tasks. A major challenge in synthesizing from scratch is
ensuring consistency with the target task, as the lack of labeling guidance
could lead to synthesis bias. We first propose a consistency metric called
V-Score, which has higher performance and lower computation cost compared with
the metrics based on grams or embedding vectors. Furthermore, we introduce
V-Synthesis, which leverages V-Score for proportional sampling to ensure both
high consistency and diversity of synthesized demonstrations. Experimental
results demonstrate that V-Synthesis yields an average performance improvement
of 2.0% compared to existing synthesis methods confirming the effectiveness of
V-Synthesis.

Motivation: 传统词嵌入模型无法适应语言动态变化（如社交媒体中的新词汇），因此需要增量词嵌入算法。

Method: RiverText实现了多种增量词嵌入技术（如Skip-gram、CBOW、Word Context Matrix），并提供了标准化框架和PyTorch后端。

Result: 库支持流式场景下的词嵌入评估，并比较了不同超参数设置下的方法性能。

Conclusion: RiverText为信息检索和自然语言处理社区提供了处理流式数据的工具，开源可用。

Abstract: Word embeddings have become essential components in various information
retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document
classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use,
traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature,
which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language
patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new
hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding
algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations
in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.
  This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating
incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for
the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work
with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media.
The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as
Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized
framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network
training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static
word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to
a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different
hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is
available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.

Motivation: 减少依赖昂贵的人类偏好数据训练奖励模型，探索更高效、理论支持的LLM对齐方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有LLM-as-a-judge方法，甚至超越显式训练的奖励模型。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种高效、可扩展的LLM对齐新范式，替代传统奖励建模阶段。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work
explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a
rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful
generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via
standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a
heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through
offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly
elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised
fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that
subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a
policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our
best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,
demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge
approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These
findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled
method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training,
heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment
as well as multi-modal models.

*Miguel Domingo,Francisco Casacuberta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于大语言模型的拼写规范化方法，一种无监督训练，另一种基于机器翻译。评估显示机器翻译效果更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文献中拼写不规范的问题，便于学者研究。

Method: 提出两种方法：无监督训练的大语言模型和基于机器翻译的模型。

Result: 两种方法均有成效，但机器翻译更适合此任务。

Conclusion: 统计机器翻译是目前拼写规范化任务的最佳选择。

Abstract: The absence of standardized spelling conventions and the organic evolution of
human language present an inherent linguistic challenge within historical
documents, a longstanding concern for scholars in the humanities. Addressing
this issue, spelling normalization endeavors to align a document's orthography
with contemporary standards. In this study, we propose two new approaches based
on large language models: one of which has been trained without a supervised
training, and a second one which has been trained for machine translation. Our
evaluation spans multiple datasets encompassing diverse languages and
historical periods, leading us to the conclusion that while both of them
yielded encouraging results, statistical machine translation still seems to be
the most suitable technology for this task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部事件驱动涌现学习的神经符号框架，用于生成语言建模，核心是分层Hopfield记忆链，能够动态构建符号序列和多尺度表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何从局部神经学习中涌现出符号结构，构建可扩展、可解释的神经符号系统。

Method: 使用分层Hopfield记忆链作为动态分词器，通过投影张量绑定共现特征，形成层次化符号表示。

Result: 模型能够从噪声中过滤自然语言模式，生成具有内部形态一致性的合成语言，且支持长程依赖和符号嵌入。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究符号结构如何从局部学习中涌现提供了方法论基础，推动了生成语言模型的神经形态架构发展。

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based
on local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical
Hopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic
tokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or
supervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences
as multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind
co-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an
emergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into
long-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter
natural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with
coherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.
Language is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints
dictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in
alignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form
of plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to
generalize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We
demonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds
distributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These
emergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value
mechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture
provides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can
emerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building
scalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and
reasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy. This
approach advances the development of neuromorphic architectures for generative
language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于BERT的集成模型，用于从临床笔记中检测和分类药物事件，显著提升了性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别健康记录和临床笔记中的关键变量（如药物、疾病、关系）在临床领域有广泛应用，n2c2 2022挑战赛为此提供了标注数据集CMED。

Method: 研究通过预训练BERT模型（基于Wikipedia和MIMIC数据），并在CMED训练数据上微调，构建集成模型，采用投票策略整合多预测结果。

Result: 实验表明，BERT集成模型将严格Micro-F和Macro-F分数分别提高了约5%和6%。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的集成模型能有效提升药物事件分类性能。

Abstract: Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from
health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the
clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural
language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records
(EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized
Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of
this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical
notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with
pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and
MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED
training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish
medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions.
These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were
integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental
results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve
strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%,
respectively.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练数据、语言接近度和语言家族对多语言翻译中信息损失的影响，发现数据量和语言结构关系共同影响翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言翻译中表现优异，但在某些语言对（尤其是数据有限或与英语差异大的语言）上仍有挑战。

Method: 通过往返翻译评估GPT-4和Llama 2，使用BLEU分数和BERT相似度指标。

Result: 数据量和语言距离交互作用显著；语言结构接近英语时翻译质量更高；语言家族也有独立影响。

Conclusion: 翻译质量不仅取决于数据量，还受语言结构和类型关系影响。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive progress in multilingual
translation, yet they continue to face challenges with certain language
pairs-particularly those with limited training data or significant linguistic
divergence from English. This study systematically investigates how training
data, language proximity, and language family affect information loss in
multilingual translation. We evaluate two large language models, GPT-4 and
Llama 2, by performing round-trip translations. Translation quality was
assessed using BLEU scores and BERT similarity metrics. Our results reveal a
robust interaction between training data size and language distance: while
abundant training data can mitigate the effects of linguistic divergence,
languages structurally closer to English consistently yield higher translation
quality in low-resource conditions. Among various distance metrics,
orthographic, phylogenetic, syntactic, and geographical distances emerge as
strong predictors of translation performance. Language family also exerts an
independent influence. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of
the linguistic constraints shaping multilingual translation in large language
models, emphasizing that translation quality is shaped not only by data volume
but also by structural and typological relationships between languages.

Motivation: 尽管AL在减少标注需求方面表现出色，但在自然语言生成（NLG）任务中的应用有限，ATGen旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 评估显示，ATGen在多种文本生成任务中显著减少了人工标注和API调用成本。

Conclusion: ATGen为NLG任务提供了一个高效的AL应用框架，降低了标注成本和资源消耗。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in reducing the
annotation effort required for training machine learning models. However,
despite the surging popularity of natural language generation (NLG) tasks in
recent years, the application of AL to NLG has been limited. In this paper, we
introduce Active Text Generation (ATGen) - a comprehensive framework that
bridges AL with text generation tasks, enabling the application of
state-of-the-art AL strategies to NLG. Our framework simplifies AL-empowered
annotation in NLG tasks using both human annotators and automatic annotation
agents based on large language models (LLMs). The framework supports LLMs
deployed as services, such as ChatGPT and Claude, or operated on-premises.
Furthermore, ATGen provides a unified platform for smooth implementation and
benchmarking of novel AL strategies tailored to NLG tasks. Finally, we present
evaluation results for state-of-the-art AL strategies across diverse settings
and multiple text generation tasks. We show that ATGen reduces both the effort
of human annotators and costs associated with API calls to LLM-based annotation
agents. The code of the framework is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的快速发展，其输出中的偏见和视角缺乏量化理解，需要一种方法来测量和控制这些视角。

Method: 提出了Perspective-Dial，包含Perspective Space（量化视角的度量空间）和Systematic Prompt Engineering（基于反馈调整LLM输出视角）。

Result: 通过实证方法，能够量化并调整LLM输出的视角，适用于多种主题。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM输出的视角控制提供了实用工具，可用于偏见检测、公共话语分析等应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are used in a variety of mission-critical roles.
Due to the rapidly developing nature of LLMs, there is a lack of quantifiable
understanding of the bias and perspective associated with LLM output. Inspired
by this need, this paper considers the broader issue of perspective or
viewpoint of general text and perspective control of large-language model (LLM)
output. Perspective-Dial consists of two main components: a (1) metric space,
dubbed Perspective Space, that enables quantitative measurements of different
perspectives regarding a topic, and the use of (2) Systematic Prompt
Engineering that utilizes greedy-coordinate descent to control LLM output
perspective based on measurement feedback from the Perspective Space. The
empirical nature of the approach allows progress to side step a principled
understanding of perspective or bias -- effectively quantifying and adjusting
outputs for a variety of topics. Potential applications include detection,
tracking and mitigation of LLM bias, narrative detection, sense making and
tracking in public discourse, and debate bot advocating given perspective.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于记忆组织的生成框架（MOG），通过分层记忆架构自动生成维基百科文章，提高了信息的准确性和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成维基百科文章需要整合多样化的信息源，确保内容的准确性和结构化。现有方法难以同时满足这些需求。

Method: MOG框架从网络文档中提取细粒度记忆单元，递归组织为分层结构，并以此指导生成过程，同时引入引用模块增强可追溯性。

Result: 在WikiStart数据集上的实验表明，MOG在生成信息丰富且可靠的维基百科文章方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MOG框架通过分层记忆结构和引用模块，显著提升了自动生成维基百科文章的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Generating Wikipedia articles autonomously is a challenging task requiring
the integration of accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured information
from diverse sources. This paper introduces the Memory Organization-based
Generation (MOG) framework, a novel approach to address these challenges by
leveraging a hierarchical memory architecture. MOG extracts fine-grained memory
units from web documents, recursively organizes them into a Wikipedia-style
hierarchical structure, and uses this structure to guide the generation
process. This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,
improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing
hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance
traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.
Evaluations on our newly created WikiStart dataset demonstrate that MOG
outperforms baseline methods in producing informative and reliable articles,
making it particularly robust in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 呼吁创建更多样化的公平性基准，并更谨慎地使用现有工具，所有数据和代码公开以促进透明性。

Abstract: Fairness benchmarks play a central role in shaping how we evaluate language
models, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to examining the
datasets that these benchmarks rely on. This survey addresses that gap by
presenting a broad and careful review of the most widely used fairness datasets
in current language model research, characterizing them along several key
dimensions including their origin, scope, content, and intended use to help
researchers better appreciate the assumptions and limitations embedded in these
resources. To support more meaningful comparisons and analyses, we introduce a
unified evaluation framework that reveals consistent patterns of demographic
disparities across datasets and scoring methods. Applying this framework to
twenty four common benchmarks, we highlight the often overlooked biases that
can influence conclusions about model fairness and offer practical guidance for
selecting, combining, and interpreting these datasets. We also point to
opportunities for creating new fairness benchmarks that reflect more diverse
social contexts and encourage more thoughtful use of these tools going forward.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法TuCo，用于量化微调对大型语言模型（LLM）个体输出的贡献，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对微调如何影响LLM个体输出的定量分析方法。

Method: 通过跟踪模型的中间隐藏状态，将微调后的LLM分解为预训练和微调两部分，并定义TuCo（微调贡献比）。

Result: 发现TuCo与模型行为和安全相关，攻击成功时TuCo较低。

Conclusion: TuCo为研究微调对模型行为和安全的影响提供了定量工具。

Abstract: Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'
(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and
systematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still
lacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that
fine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original
pre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,
providing a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a
simple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We
introduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned
LLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we
find that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling
the fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding
and our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the
ratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training
component. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs
circumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is
consistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those
where they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on
model outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo
enables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and
safety, and vice versa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型虽然生成质量高，但逐词生成的特性限制了速度，成为瓶颈。

Method: 采用流水线解码器，同时生成多个子序列，每个时间步为每个子序列生成新词以实现并行。

Result: 在问答、文本摘要和关键词生成等任务中，显著提高了生成速度，且质量和内存消耗无明显损失。

Conclusion: 流水线解码器有效解决了自回归模型的生成速度瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As the basis of generative AI, an autoregressive model requires the
generation of a new token depending on all the previously generated tokens,
which brings high quality but also restricts the model to generate tokens one
by one, forming a bottleneck limiting the generation speed. In this paper, we
propose a new decoder architecture that efficiently generates text in parallel
for context-aware generation tasks. Our proposed pipelined decoder initiates
the generation of multiple subsequences simultaneously, and, at each time-step,
it generates a new token for each subsequence to realize parallelism.
Experiments on multiple text generation tasks, including question answering,
text summarization, and keyphrase generation, show that our pipelined decoder
significantly improves the generation speed without a significant loss of
generation quality or additional memory consumption.

Result: ATF减少约70%的表格单元，提升跨领域表格问答性能，但在表格事实验证任务中略有下降。

Conclusion: ATF能自适应平衡信息量和简洁性，适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning often struggle with
large tables due to input length limits. We propose ATF (Adaptive Table
Filtering Framework), a modular and question-aware filtering pipeline that
prunes uninformative columns and rows using LLM-generated column descriptions,
clustering, and sparse-dense alignment scores. ATF integrates seamlessly with
existing models (e.g., TAPAS, TAPEX) without retraining. Experiments show that
ATF reduces table cells by ~70\%, boosting performance on out-of-domain TableQA
tasks while causing slight performance drops on Table Fact Verification, where
full-table context is more critical. These results highlight ATF's ability to
adaptively balance informativeness and minimalism across tasks.

Conclusion: TAIRA通过思想模式蒸馏和多智能体协作，显著提升了交互式推荐系统处理复杂用户意图的能力。

Abstract: Interactive recommendation is a typical information-seeking task that allows
users to interactively express their needs through natural language and obtain
personalized recommendations. Large language model-powered (LLM-powered) agents
have become a new paradigm in interactive recommendations, effectively
capturing users' real-time needs and enhancing personalized experiences.
However, due to limited planning and generalization capabilities, existing
formulations of LLM-powered interactive recommender agents struggle to
effectively address diverse and complex user intents, such as intuitive,
unrefined, or occasionally ambiguous requests. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel thought-augmented interactive recommender agent system (TAIRA)
that addresses complex user intents through distilled thought patterns.
Specifically, TAIRA is designed as an LLM-powered multi-agent system featuring
a manager agent that orchestrates recommendation tasks by decomposing user
needs and planning subtasks, with its planning capacity strengthened through
Thought Pattern Distillation (TPD), a thought-augmentation method that extracts
high-level thoughts from the agent's and human experts' experiences. Moreover,
we designed a set of user simulation schemes to generate personalized queries
of different difficulties and evaluate the recommendations based on specific
datasets. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across multiple datasets,
TAIRA exhibits significantly enhanced performance compared to existing methods.
Notably, TAIRA shows a greater advantage on more challenging tasks while
generalizing effectively on novel tasks, further validating its superiority in
managing complex user intents within interactive recommendation systems. The
code is publicly available at:https://github.com/Alcein/TAIRA.

Conclusion: RFT在多模态大语言模型中具有稳定持续学习的潜力。

Abstract: Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large
language models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their
impact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw
puzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and
systematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal
model, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid
task acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more
slowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon
through the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct
samples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,
mitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on
correct RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly
learning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than
algorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight
RFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language
models.

Conclusion: 自动化框架可量化LLM生成内容中的记忆、创造性和无意义，为模型创造力提供严谨证据。

Abstract: This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense
found in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).
Precisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in
LLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate
potential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our
study to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human
annotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting
each recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are
memorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during
training--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.
We find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in
online documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong
reliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis
beyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an
``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,
parsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,
comparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor
and annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on
ingredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale
quantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,
providing rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SemDiD的新方法，通过在嵌入空间中操作，结合正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置偏差概率评估，显著提升语义多样性解码效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注词汇多样性而非语义多样性，限制了Best-of-N策略、基于群体的强化学习和数据合成的效果。

Method: SemDiD通过正交方向引导、动态组间排斥和位置偏差概率评估三种机制，在嵌入空间中平衡质量和多样性。

Result: 实验表明，SemDiD在多个任务中优于现有方法，Best-of-N覆盖率提升1.4-5.2%，RLHF训练收敛速度加快15%，准确率提高2.1%。

Conclusion: SemDiD有效解决了语义多样性解码的问题，为相关应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications
requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods
primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation
significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement
learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam
search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to
ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided
Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances
quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal
directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased
probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using
adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality
thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD
consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by
1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15%
while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.

TL;DR: 研究评估了基于大五人格特征的LLM代理是否能复现人格特质驱动的行为差异，发现部分特质（如宜人性和尽责性）能可靠复现，但也揭示了LLM在表达人格时的系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成的行为数据是否能准确反映人格特质驱动的心理差异，为行为模拟提供伦理且低成本的替代方案。

Method: 利用已知人格特征的人类数据集，创建匹配的LLM代理，比较其与人类在新闻辨别任务中的反应模式。

Result: 部分人格特质（如宜人性和尽责性）与错误信息易感性的关联被可靠复现，但其他特质存在偏差。

Conclusion: 人格对齐的LLM在行为模拟中具有潜力但也存在局限，为人工代理的认知多样性建模提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make it possible to generate synthetic
behavioural data at scale, offering an ethical and low-cost alternative to
human experiments. Whether such data can faithfully capture psychological
differences driven by personality traits, however, remains an open question. We
evaluate the capacity of LLM agents, conditioned on Big-Five profiles, to
reproduce personality-based variation in susceptibility to misinformation,
focusing on news discernment, the ability to judge true headlines as true and
false headlines as false. Leveraging published datasets in which human
participants with known personality profiles rated headline accuracy, we create
matching LLM agents and compare their responses to the original human patterns.
Certain trait-misinformation associations, notably those involving
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, are reliably replicated, whereas others
diverge, revealing systematic biases in how LLMs internalize and express
personality. The results underscore both the promise and the limits of
personality-aligned LLMs for behavioral simulation, and offer new insight into
modeling cognitive diversity in artificial agents.

Motivation: 评估文本分类系统的鲁棒性，通过最小修改改变模型预测。

Method: 扩展BeamAttack算法，支持单词删除和跳过替换，集成LIME优化替换优先级。

Result: 在BiLSTM、BERT和RoBERTa等模型上实现99%攻击成功率，保持文本相似性。

TL;DR: ZEST是一种零样本上下文适应框架，通过合成代理语料库实现无需目标语料库访问或微调的域适应嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文感知嵌入方法需要访问目标语料库或进行领域特定微调的实际障碍，特别是在隐私敏感或资源受限的环境中。

Method: 使用多步分层程序合成代理语料库，模拟目标领域的关键分布，供冻结的上下文感知编码器使用。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，ZEST仅用五个示例文档的零样本合成上下文适应性能接近全目标语料库访问模型的0.5%以内。

Conclusion: ZEST为受限环境中部署高性能、可适应嵌入提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Context-aware embedding methods boost retrieval accuracy by conditioning on
corpus statistics (e.g., term co-occurrence and topical patterns) extracted
from neighboring documents. However, this context-aware approach requires
access to the target corpus or requires domain-specific finetuning, posing
practical barriers in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. We
present ZEST, a zero-shot contextual adaptation framework that replaces real
corpus access with a one-time offline synthesis of a compact proxy. Given only
a handful exemplar documents representative of the general target domain, we
use a multi-step hierarchical procedure to generate a synthetic context corpus
of several hundred documents that aims to emulate key domain-specific
distributions. At inference, the frozen context-aware encoder uses this proxy
corpus -- without any finetuning or target corpus access -- to produce
domain-adapted embeddings. Across the MTEB benchmark, ZEST's zero-shot
synthetic context adaptation using only five example documents performs within
0.5% of models leveraging full target corpus access -- demonstrating remarkable
efficacy without any retraining. ZEST thus provides a practical method for
deploying high-performance, adaptable embeddings in constrained environments.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮、长程任务中作为自主代理时的可扩展性和训练效率问题。

Method: 引入L0训练管道和NB-Agent框架，采用“代码即动作”模式，通过REPL实现。使用强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）进行训练。

Result: 在SimpleQA和HotpotQA基准测试中，Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的准确率分别从30%提升至80%和从22%提升至41%。

Conclusion: L0系统显著提升了代理的任务解决能力，并已开源全部代码和训练方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to act as autonomous agents for
multi-turn, long-horizon tasks remains significant challenges in scalability
and training efficiency. To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable,
end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost,
extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier
for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce
NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action"
fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality
question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model
can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method
boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41
%. We have open-sourced the entire L0 system, including our L0 series models,
the NB-Agent, a complete training pipeline, and the corresponding training

TL;DR: AutoEvoEval是一个基于进化的评估框架，用于生成多样化和具有挑战性的测试样本，以评估大语言模型（LLMs）在封闭任务中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准多为静态，无法全面评估LLMs在真实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出AutoEvoEval框架，引入22种可解释的原子进化操作，支持多轮组合生成测试样本。

Result: 实验显示原子操作平均导致准确率下降7.283%，多步组合可放大对抗效果达52.932%。

Conclusion: 当前基准可能高估模型泛化能力，需进化感知的鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various
tasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to
fully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior
work using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved
evaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and
multi-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for
close-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval
introduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports
multi-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,
challenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments
addressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source
LLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of
7.283\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the
largest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same
perturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial
effects by up to 52.932\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may
overestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for
evolution-aware robustness evaluation. Code and resources are available at:

TL;DR: 研究量化并分析了五种大型语言模型在答案不确定性不同情况下的位置偏差，发现低不确定性时偏差几乎不存在，但不确定性高时偏差呈指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在二元问题回答中因选项顺序而产生的系统性偏好，尤其是在不同不确定性条件下的表现。

Method: 通过改编SQuAD-it数据集，增加错误选项并逐步减少上下文，创建从低到高不确定性的数据集；同时评估WebGPT和Winning Arguments两个高不确定性基准。

Result: 位置偏差在低不确定性条件下几乎不存在，但在高不确定性条件下显著增加。

Conclusion: 模型在答案不确定性高时更容易受到选项顺序的影响，需在设计评估方法时考虑这一偏差。

Abstract: Positional bias in binary question answering occurs when a model
systematically favors one choice over another based solely on the ordering of
presented options. In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias
across five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.
We re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option
and then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more
out-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high
uncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty
benchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality
scores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive
argument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order
of the "correct" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically
flipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both
Preference Fairness and Position Consistency. We observe that positional bias
is nearly absent under low-uncertainty conditions, but grows exponentially when
it becomes doubtful to decide which option is correct.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DuP-PO的新算法，旨在解决大型推理模型（LRMs）在处理简单任务时因过度思考而效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理简单任务时会产生冗余的思考标记，导致效率降低，甚至影响正确推理。

Method: 提出了DuP-PO算法，包括平衡采样策略、细粒度优势控制技术和策略整形方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，DuP-PO显著提高了模型的标记效率，同时保持了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: DuP-PO有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at solving complex problems but face an
overthinking dilemma. When handling simple tasks, they often produce verbose
responses overloaded with thinking tokens (e.g., wait, however). These tokens
trigger unnecessary high-level reasoning behaviors like reflection and
backtracking, reducing efficiency. In this work, our pilot study reveals that
these thinking-token-induced behaviors are not essential for effective
problem-solving and may even hinder correct reasoning within constrained token
budgets. We identify this phenomenon as the thinking trap. To mitigate this
issue, we propose Dual Policy Preference Optimization (DuP-PO), a novel
algorithm featuring: (1) A rollout sampling strategy that guarantees balanced
exposure to responses with and without thinking tokens; (2) A fine-grained
advantage control technique to dynamically regulate the prediction of target
tokens; (3) A policy shaping method ensuring stable gradient contributions from
thinking tokens. Experimental results on five popular math reasoning benchmarks
show that DuP-PO performs well on the popular LRM, which significantly improves
their token efficiency during reasoning, while achieving superior performance
of the base model.

Motivation: 当前推理基准的设计和评估方法存在缺陷，可能导致对LLM推理能力的误判，因此需要更有效的评估协议。

Method: 使用五种LLM（GPT-3、GPT-3.5、GPT-4、GPT-o1和LLaMA 3.1）作为诊断工具，结合系统的人工标注和重新评估，分析基准中的问题。

Result: 发现基准中存在重复项、模糊措辞和不可信答案等问题，模型性能对输入微小变化敏感，高分可能仅反映对格式特定线索的匹配而非推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前基于基准的LLM推理能力评估存在局限性，需要开发更注重推理过程的评估方法。论文发布了审计数据和工具以支持更可解释的诊断评估。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic audit of three widely used reasoning benchmarks,
SocialIQa, FauxPas-EAI, and ToMi, and uncover pervasive flaws in both benchmark
items and evaluation methodology. Using five LLMs (GPT-{3, 3.5, 4, o1}, and
LLaMA 3.1) as diagnostic tools, we identify structural, semantic, and pragmatic
issues in benchmark design (e.g., duplicated items, ambiguous wording, and
implausible answers), as well as scoring procedures that prioritize output form
over reasoning process. Through systematic human annotation and re-evaluation
on cleaned benchmark subsets, we find that model scores often improve not due
to due to erratic surface wording variations and not to improved reasoning.
Infact, further analyses show that model performance is highly sensitive to
minor input variations such as context availability and phrasing, revealing
that high scores may reflect alignment with format-specific cues rather than
consistent inference based on the input. These findings challenge the validity
of current benchmark-based claims about reasoning in LLMs, and highlight the
need for evaluation protocols that assess reasoning as a process of drawing
inference from available information, rather than as static output selection.
We release audited data and evaluation tools to support more interpretable and
diagnostic assessments of model reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在问题解决能力上有显著进步，但在复杂多步推理任务中仍存在困难。

Method: MAPS采用迭代优化过程，结合CoT、自我反思和动态调整的提示技术，逐步修正推理错误。

Result: 实验表明，MAPS在多个基准测试中优于标准CoT，并能与专用推理模型竞争。

Conclusion: MAPS通过限制反思深度，平衡了推理性能与成本，为通用LLMs提供了高效的推理解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their problem-solving capabilities. However, these models still
struggle when faced with complex multi-step reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Layered Self-Reflection with Auto-Prompting (MAPS) framework,
a novel approach designed to enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning in LLMs
by integrating techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and
Auto-Prompting. Unlike traditional static prompting methods, MAPS employs an
iterative refinement process. Initially, the model generates a solution using
CoT prompting. When errors are detected, an adaptive self-reflection mechanism
identifies and analyzes them, generating tailored prompts to guide corrections.
These dynamically adjusted prompts enable the model to iteratively refine its
reasoning. Experiments on four well-established benchmarks across multiple LLMs
show that MAPS significantly outperforms standard CoT and achieves competitive
results with reasoning-optimized models. In addition, MAPS enables
general-purpose LLMs to reach performance levels comparable to specialized
reasoning models. While deeper reflection layers improve accuracy, they also
increase token usage and costs. To balance this trade-off, MAPS strategically
limits reflection depth, ensuring an optimal balance between cost and reasoning
performance.

Motivation: 研究如何评估LLM内部知识的真实性，并解决现有方法中的假设缺陷。

Method: 提出sAwMIL方法，基于多实例学习和共形预测，利用LLM内部激活将陈述分类为真、假或中性。

Result: sAwMIL在16个开源LLM上验证，发现真实性信号集中在模型深度的第三部分，且真假信号不对称。线性探针在聊天模型中表现更好。

Conclusion: sAwMIL为验证LLM内部知识提供了一种可靠方法，揭示了其知识的不对称性和复杂性。

Abstract: We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and
claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic
knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we
assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for
probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.
To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse
Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal
activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.
sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We
evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including
both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the
insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the
third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always
symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default
models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for
some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge
distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from
true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable
method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their
probabilistic internal knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs在形态学处理上仍有改进空间，IMPACT框架为未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress on various
multilingual benchmarks and are increasingly used to generate and evaluate text
in non-English languages. However, while they may produce fluent outputs, it
remains unclear to what extent these models truly grasp the underlying
linguistic complexity of those languages, particularly in morphology. To
investigate this, we introduce IMPACT, a synthetically generated evaluation
framework focused on inflectional morphology, which we publicly release,
designed to evaluate LLM performance across five morphologically rich
languages: Arabic, Russian, Finnish, Turkish, and Hebrew. IMPACT includes
unit-test-style cases covering both shared and language-specific phenomena,
from basic verb inflections (e.g., tense, number, gender) to unique features
like Arabic's reverse gender agreement and vowel harmony in Finnish and
Turkish. We assess eight multilingual LLMs that, despite strong English
performance, struggle with other languages and uncommon morphological patterns,
especially when judging ungrammatical examples. We also show that Chain of
Thought and Thinking Models can degrade performance. Our work exposes gaps in
LLMs' handling of linguistic complexity, pointing to clear room for
improvement. To support further research, we publicly release the IMPACT
framework.

Conclusion: 隐喻提示是一种有效的低资源语言仇恨言论检测方法，且对环境的影响较小。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media leads to a marked increase in hate
speech, which threatens personal lives and results in numerous hate crimes.
Detecting hate speech presents several challenges: diverse dialects, frequent
code-mixing, and the prevalence of misspelled words in user-generated content
on social media platforms. Recent progress in hate speech detection is
typically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource
languages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this
limitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on
low-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -
zero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot
prompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to
detect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the
metaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that
marks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We
investigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and
compare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,
Word2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer
perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated
recurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in
the low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource
language - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The
performance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and
environmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity
usage, and computational time.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可组合、领域自适应的MLLMs提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved success across various
domains. However, their applicability tends to degrade when confronted with
different types of data inputs, especially for MLLMs that have been fine-tuned
for specific tasks. Despite its importance, the study of knowledge sharing
among domain-specific MLLMs--such as those trained for mathematics or
code--remains largely underexplored. To address the fragmentation of knowledge
across domain-specialized MLLMs, we propose a unified parameter integration
framework that enables modular composition of expert capabilities. Our method
is grounded in a novel Compatibility-Aware Parameter Splicing (CAPS) strategy,
which leverages both local functional attribution and global
information-theoretic signals to guide selective parameter fusion. By extending
this mechanism to the low-rank adaptation layer granularity, we ensure
efficient integration with minimal inference overhead. Furthermore, we
introduce a domain compatibility scoring mechanism that quantifies inter-expert
alignment at the activation level and correlates with downstream task utility.
This principled fusion protocol allows the final model to synergize
heterogeneous expertise while preserving structural modularity. Extensive
evaluations across diverse multimodal benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
our framework, offering a scalable path toward compositional, domain-adaptive
MLLMs.

Language Models (LLMs) and extract interpretable concepts from their internal
representations. These concepts are linear combinations of neuron activations
that correspond to human-interpretable features. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of SAE-based explainability approaches for sentence
classification, a domain where such methods have not been extensively explored.
We present a novel SAE-based architecture tailored for text classification,
leveraging a specialized classifier head and incorporating an activation rate
sparsity loss. We benchmark this architecture against established methods such
as ConceptShap, Independent Component Analysis, and other SAE-based concept
extraction techniques. Our evaluation covers two classification benchmarks and
four fine-tuned LLMs from the Pythia family. We further enrich our analysis
with two novel metrics for measuring the precision of concept-based
explanations, using an external sentence encoder. Our empirical results show
that our architecture improves both the causality and interpretability of the
extracted features.

Motivation: 构建高质量的多语言偏好数据集资源密集且稀缺，现有数据集多为英文。

Result: 使用TaP生成的数据集训练的LLM性能优于现有开源数据集，甚至超过180倍规模的数据集。

Conclusion: TaP框架为多语言偏好数据集构建提供了高效解决方案，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large
language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability
to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However,
constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets
for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these
challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided
\underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which
facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across
various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows
fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity
and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform
supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those
trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on
TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an
open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

Abstract: Scientific information expresses human understanding of nature. This
knowledge is largely disseminated in different forms of text, including
scientific papers, news articles, and discourse among people on social media.
While important for accelerating our pursuit of knowledge, not all scientific
text is faithful to the underlying science. As the volume of this text has
burgeoned online in recent years, it has become a problem of societal
importance to be able to identify the faithfulness of a given piece of
scientific text automatically. This thesis is concerned with the cultivation of
datasets, methods, and tools for machine understanding of scientific language,
in order to analyze and understand science communication at scale. To arrive at
this, I present several contributions in three areas of natural language
processing and machine learning: automatic fact checking, learning with limited
data, and scientific text processing. These contributions include new methods
and resources for identifying check-worthy claims, adversarial claim
generation, multi-source domain adaptation, learning from crowd-sourced labels,
cite-worthiness detection, zero-shot scientific fact checking, detecting
exaggerated scientific claims, and modeling degrees of information change in
science communication. Critically, I demonstrate how the research outputs of
this thesis are useful for effectively learning from limited amounts of
scientific text in order to identify misinformative scientific statements and
generate new insights into the science communication process

Motivation: 先天性心脏病的复杂性和长期挑战难以通过传统临床指标全面捕捉，而手动主题分析效率低下且难以扩展。

Method: 采用多代理LLM框架，结合强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF），实现端到端的自动主题分析。

Result: 系统能够高效、可扩展地分析大规模定性数据，并支持针对特定临床场景的LLM微调。

Conclusion: 全自动LLM流程为患者为中心的分析提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于复杂临床叙事的研究。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) presents complex, lifelong challenges often
underrepresented in traditional clinical metrics. While unstructured narratives
offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic
analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully
automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on
clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full
transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where
specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with
human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable,
patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be
fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在数学教育中的实际能力，尤其是解决数学文字题时是否理解现实背景，以评估其作为教学工具的适用性。

Method: 通过三部分研究：技术概述对比LLMs与学生解决文字题的差异；系统综述213项研究中的文字题类型；实证评估四种LLMs在287道文字题上的表现。

Result: LLMs在解决无需考虑现实背景的s-problems上表现近乎完美，但在处理现实背景复杂或荒谬的问题时表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs掌握了表面解题过程，但缺乏对文字题现实背景的理解，可能限制其在数学课堂中的教学价值。

Abstract: The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question
of how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support
mathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle
textual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word
problems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the
real-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We
conducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including
three parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in
research, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical
word problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the
conceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs
and students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled
mathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics
education. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most
popular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require
a consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our
evaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems
shows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,
including a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed
weaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or
non-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have
mastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,
which potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics
classrooms.

Conclusion: EXPERT提供了一种标准化且高质量的图像描述评估方法，为未来研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models and vision-language models have led
to growing interest in explainable evaluation metrics for image captioning.
However, these metrics generate explanations without standardized criteria, and
the overall quality of the generated explanations remains unverified. In this
paper, we propose EXPERT, a reference-free evaluation metric that provides
structured explanations based on three fundamental criteria: fluency,
relevance, and descriptiveness. By constructing large-scale datasets of
high-quality structured explanations, we develop a two-stage evaluation
template to effectively supervise a vision-language model for both scoring and
explanation generation. EXPERT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark
datasets while providing significantly higher-quality explanations than
existing metrics, as validated through comprehensive human evaluation. Our code
and datasets are available at https://github.com/hjkim811/EXPERT.

Method: 开发并红队测试开源防御管线，提出STACK攻击方法，并在不同设置下评估其效果。

Result: 新型分类器在ClearHarm数据集上将攻击成功率降至0%，但STACK攻击在无目标管线访问下仍能达到33%成功率。

Conclusion: 建议开发者采用特定缓解措施以应对分阶段攻击。

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against
catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus
model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including
Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the
security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or
attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an
open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted
input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard
model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack
success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second,
we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on
ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier
pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33%
ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no
access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations
that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

TL;DR: 语言模型的预测能力与其嵌入空间的广度紧密相关，嵌入空间越分散，困惑度越低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型的嵌入空间分散度与困惑度的关系，并探索其在无标签数据任务中的应用。

Method: 通过测量隐藏向量间的平均余弦距离（分散度），分析其与困惑度的相关性，并设计推离目标以提升分散度。

Result: 分散度与困惑度呈强负相关，可用于模型选择、检索方法优化，并通过推离目标直接提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入空间的分散度是语言模型性能的重要指标，可广泛应用于无监督任务中。

Abstract: We show that a language model's ability to predict text is tightly linked to
the breadth of its embedding space: models that spread their contextual
representations more widely tend to achieve lower perplexity. Concretely, we
find that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance
among hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity
across diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,
news, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how
dispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring
labeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to
predict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for
model selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion
pinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,
bypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple
push-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both
single-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in
each.

Motivation: 传统手动比较方法耗时且易出错，研究旨在探索预训练模型在提高效率和准确性方面的潜力。

Method: 使用E5、AlephBERT、MPNet和LaBSE模型生成词嵌入，并通过余弦相似度和Wasserstein距离评估其检测平行段落的能力。

Result: E5在平行段落检测中表现最佳，AlephBERT在区分非平行段落上更强。

Conclusion: 预训练模型能有效提升古代文本平行段落的检测效率，适用于更广泛的古代语言研究。

Abstract: Identifying parallel passages in biblical Hebrew is foundational in biblical
scholarship for uncovering intertextual relationships. Traditional methods rely
on manual comparison, which is labor-intensive and prone to human error. This
study evaluates the potential of pre-trained transformer-based language models,
including E5, AlephBERT, MPNet, and LaBSE, for detecting textual parallels in
the Hebrew Bible. Focusing on known parallels between the books of Samuel/Kings
and Chronicles, I assessed each model's capability to generate word embeddings
that delineate parallel from non-parallel passages. Utilizing cosine similarity
and Wasserstein Distance measures, I found that E5 and AlephBERT show
significant promise, with E5 excelling in parallel detection and AlephBERT
demonstrating stronger non-parallel differentiation. These findings indicate
that pre-trained models can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of detecting
intertextual parallels in ancient texts, suggesting broader applications for
ancient language studies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的图像对齐框架，针对结构健康监测中的裂纹定位问题，通过非线性扩散和RANSAC估计实现高精度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征检测方法（如SIFT、SURF）在高频边缘抑制和纹理表面表现不佳，而轻量级方法（如ORB、BRISK）在重复性上存在问题。

Method: 采用非线性各向异性扩散构建裂纹保留尺度空间，结合RANSAC估计单应性变换，无需训练或参数调整。

Result: 在多种实际条件下，裂纹面积和长度误差分别减少70%和90%，对齐误差低于5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为裂纹演化监测提供了一种无监督、轻量且物理基础明确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate image alignment is essential for monitoring crack evolution in
structural health monitoring (SHM), particularly under real-world conditions
involving perspective distortion, occlusion, and low contrast. However,
traditional feature detectors such as SIFT and SURF, which rely on
Gaussian-based scale spaces, tend to suppress high-frequency edges, making them
unsuitable for thin crack localization. Lightweight binary alternatives like
ORB and BRISK, while computationally efficient, often suffer from poor keypoint
repeatability on textured or shadowed surfaces. This study presents a
physics-informed alignment framework that adapts the open KAZE architecture to
SHM-specific challenges. By utilizing nonlinear anisotropic diffusion to
construct a crack-preserving scale space, and integrating RANSAC-based
homography estimation, the framework enables accurate geometric correction
without the need for training, parameter tuning, or prior calibration. The
method is validated on time-lapse images of masonry and concrete acquired via
handheld smartphone under varied field conditions, including shadow
interference, cropping, oblique viewing angles, and surface clutter. Compared
to classical detectors, the proposed framework reduces crack area and spine
length errors by up to 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively, while
maintaining sub-5 percent alignment error in key metrics. Unsupervised,
interpretable, and computationally lightweight, this approach supports scalable
deployment via UAVs and mobile platforms. By tailoring nonlinear scale-space
modeling to SHM image alignment, this work offers a robust and physically
grounded alternative to conventional techniques for tracking real-world crack
evolution.

Abstract: Accurate pest population monitoring and tracking their dynamic changes are
crucial for precision agriculture decision-making. A common limitation in
existing vision-based automatic pest counting research is that models are
typically evaluated on datasets with ground truth but deployed in real-world
scenarios without assessing the reliability of counting results due to the lack
of ground truth. To this end, this paper proposed a method for comprehensively
evaluating pest counting confidence in the image, based on information related
to counting results and external environmental conditions. First, a pest
detection network is used for pest detection and counting, extracting counting
result-related information. Then, the pest images undergo image quality
assessment, image complexity assessment, and pest distribution uniformity
assessment. And the changes in image clarity caused by stirring during image
acquisition are quantified by calculating the average gradient magnitude.
Notably, we designed a hypothesis-driven multi-factor sensitivity analysis
method to select the optimal image quality assessment and image complexity
assessment methods. And we proposed an adaptive DBSCAN clustering algorithm for
pest distribution uniformity assessment. Finally, the obtained information
related to counting results and external environmental conditions is input into
a regression model for prediction, resulting in the final pest counting
confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study dedicated to
comprehensively evaluating counting confidence in counting tasks, and
quantifying the relationship between influencing factors and counting
confidence through a model. Experimental results show our method reduces MSE by
31.7% and improves R2 by 15.2% on the pest counting confidence test set,
compared to the baseline built primarily on information related to counting
results.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, but their high
computation cost in iterative sampling remains a significant bottleneck. In
this work, we present an in-depth and insightful study of state-of-the-art
acceleration techniques for diffusion models, including caching and
quantization, revealing their limitations in computation error and generation
quality. To break these limits, this work introduces Modulated Diffusion
(MoDiff), an innovative, rigorous, and principled framework that accelerates
generative modeling through modulated quantization and error compensation.
MoDiff not only inherents the advantages of existing caching and quantization
methods but also serves as a general framework to accelerate all diffusion
models. The advantages of MoDiff are supported by solid theoretical insight and
analysis. In addition, extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and LSUN demonstrate
that MoDiff significant reduces activation quantization from 8 bits to 3 bits
without performance degradation in post-training quantization (PTQ). Our code
implementation is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/MoDiff.

Motivation: 医院和长期护理机构中，床旁跌倒事故频发，现有警报系统反应滞后，需提前预测离床意图以减少伤害。

Method: 使用四个低成本负载传感器采集信号，转换为RGB线图和三种纹理图，通过双流Swin Transformer（ViFusionTST）并行处理并融合。

Result: 在真实数据集上，ViFusionTST达到0.885的准确率和0.794的F1分数，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 基于图像融合的负载信号分类方法实用且高效，适用于实时、隐私保护的跌倒预防。

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a leading source of injury in hospitals and
long-term-care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a
patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be
predicted using only four low-cost load cells mounted under the bed legs. The
resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary
images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps -
recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field - that
expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin
Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses
them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights.
  To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data
from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset
ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing
recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC.
The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time
series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time,
privacy-preserving fall prevention.

Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic
origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network
models, leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional
traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite
imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both
parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To
extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for
class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level
traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information,
we formulate a computational graph-based DODE model that calibrates dynamic
network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts and travel times
from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To
assess the accuracy and scalability of the proposed framework, we conduct a
series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The
results of out-of-sample tests demonstrate that supplementing traditional data
with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance,
especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also confirm
the framework's capability to handle large-scale networks, supporting its
potential for practical deployment in cities of varying sizes. Sensitivity
analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite
imagery data.

Motivation: 手术风险识别对患者安全至关重要，但现有模型在视觉安全违规检测方面存在不足。

Method: 通过生成34,000张合成图像和214张人工标注图像构建数据集，用于微调模型并研究VS-KC。

Result: 微调后的模型在训练过的冲突实体上表现显著提升，但对未训练实体类型效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究提出了数据生成方法、开源数据集和基准测试，为VS-KC研究提供了资源和分析。

Abstract: Surgical risk identification is critical for patient safety and reducing
preventable medical errors. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit
visual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety
violations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a
dataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,
depicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established
safety rules. These images were created to alleviate data scarcity and examine
MLLMs vulnerabilities. In addition, the dataset includes 214 human-annotated
images that serve as a gold-standard reference for validation. This
comprehensive dataset, spanning diverse perspectives, stages, and
configurations, is designed to expose and study VS-KC. Fine-tuning on OR-VSKC
significantly improves MLLMs' detection of trained conflict entities and
generalizes well to new viewpoints for these entities, but performance on
untrained entity types remains poor, highlighting learning specificity and the
need for comprehensive training. The main contributions of this work include:
(1) a data generation methodology tailored for rule-violation scenarios; (2)
the release of the OR-VSKC dataset and its associated benchmark as open-source
resources; and (3) an empirical analysis of violation-sensitive knowledge
consistency in representative MLLMs. The dataset and appendix are available at

detection, and rural/urban classification. However, many existing studies tend
to focus on narrow tasks or datasets, which limits their ability to generalize
across various remote sensing classification challenges. To overcome this, we
propose a novel model, SpatialNet-ViT, leveraging the power of Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL). This integrated approach
combines spatial awareness with contextual understanding, improving both
classification accuracy and scalability. Additionally, techniques like data
augmentation, transfer learning, and multi-task learning are employed to
enhance model robustness and its ability to generalize across diverse datasets

Motivation: 传统二维位置数据无法全面评估盘带技能（如平衡、方向和控球），研究旨在通过三维姿态数据弥补这一不足。

Method: 从2022/23赛季欧冠的1,736次盘带中提取姿态特征，结合传统二维数据，评估其对盘带成功率的预测效果。

Result: 姿态特征（如攻击者平衡和攻防双方方向对齐）对预测盘带成功率有显著贡献，结合二维数据后模型性能提升。

Conclusion: 三维姿态数据为足球盘带技能评估提供了更全面的视角，未来可进一步优化特征提取和应用。

Abstract: Data analysis plays an increasingly important role in soccer, offering new
ways to evaluate individual and team performance. One specific application is
the evaluation of dribbles: one-on-one situations where an attacker attempts to
bypass a defender with the ball. While previous research has primarily relied
on 2D positional tracking data, this fails to capture aspects like balance,
orientation, and ball control, limiting the depth of current insights. This
study explores how pose tracking data (capturing players' posture and movement
in three dimensions) can improve our understanding of dribbling skills. We
extract novel pose-based features from 1,736 dribbles in the 2022/23 Champions
League season and evaluate their impact on dribble success. Our results
indicate that features capturing the attacker's balance and the alignment of
the orientation between the attacker and defender are informative for
predicting dribble success. Incorporating these pose-based features on top of
features derived from traditional 2D positional data leads to a measurable
improvement in model performance.

Abstract: Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of
abnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from
computer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with
machine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While
supervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new
unsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from
structural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its
spatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal
patches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the
location prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into
pixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the
ability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach
to the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021
and MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The

Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging
in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic
aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,
obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose
a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation
using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an
object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more
quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the
segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create
realistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a
contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose
to first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create
counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source
backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the
training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the
real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a
supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could
provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments
on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds
compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested
on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to
natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids
pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics. The basecode

Abstract: Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which
enhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen
domain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction
(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth
exploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution
transformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a
training-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.
Our motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise
statistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in
conditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise
prediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise
Alignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics
to domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving
domain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we
directly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the
noise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the
more challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions
closer to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of
sampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions
progressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling
process. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA
capability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间缺乏可见光数据限制了全天候气象观测，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于FY4B卫星的AGRI热红外数据，开发了生成扩散模型RefDiff，用于夜间可见光反射率反演。

Result: RefDiff的SSIM指数达0.90，在复杂云区和厚云区表现尤为突出，夜间反演性能与白天相当。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了夜间可见光反射率反演能力，拓展了夜间可见光数据的应用潜力。

Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial
for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather
monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night,
it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using
visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative
diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal
infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation
Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we
developed a high-precision visible light reflectance retrieval model, called
Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m},
0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance
retrieval at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only
significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides
uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,
with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud
structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime retrieval capability was
validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance
to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial
progress in the ability to retrieve visible light reflectance at night, with
the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Conclusion: 该框架具有快速推理能力，适用于大图像处理，并被专业评估者认为是一种有潜力的辅助工具。

Abstract: This investigation attempts to create an automated framework for fault
detection and organization for usage in contemporary radiography, as per NDE
4.0. The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is
sufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,
and determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its
basic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing
223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as
virtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the
preparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data
to produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the
model, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call
rate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong
differentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves
exceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and
fake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly
wins. Due to the framework's fast derivation speed, large images can be broken
down efficiently and quickly. Professional controllers evaluate the transmitted
system in the field and believe that it has a guarantee as a support device in
the testing cycle, irrespective of particular equipment cut-off points and
programming resemblance.

Method: 使用278张标注图像训练和测试三种计算机视觉模型，比较mAP和精度。

Result: Yolov11和Yolov12的mAP@50为81.9%，RF-DETR为77.7%，但RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中表现更优。

Conclusion: RF-DETR在不常见损伤检测中更具优势，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Containers are an integral part of the logistics industry and act as a
barrier for cargo. A typical service life for a container is more than 20
years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the
mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard
for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company.
Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key
for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper,
we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three
state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR.
We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the
model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of
this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage
detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9%
compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for
not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others
overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers
as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保存多个对象、语义对齐和场景控制方面存在不足，需要一种更高效且可控的解决方案。

Method: 采用N通道ControlNet，结合对象保存模块、背景引导模块和高频覆盖模块，确保细节保留和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在对象保存、语义一致性和用户控制方面实现了显著改进，为文本到图像生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Preserve Anything}, a novel method for controlled image
synthesis that addresses key limitations in object preservation and semantic
consistency in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Existing approaches often fail
(i) to preserve multiple objects with fidelity, (ii) maintain semantic
alignment with prompts, or (iii) provide explicit control over scene
composition. To overcome these challenges, the proposed method employs an
N-channel ControlNet that integrates (i) object preservation with size and
placement agnosticism, color and detail retention, and artifact elimination,
(ii) high-resolution, semantically consistent backgrounds with accurate
shadows, lighting, and prompt adherence, and (iii) explicit user control over
background layouts and lighting conditions. Key components of our framework
include object preservation and background guidance modules, enforcing lighting
consistency and a high-frequency overlay module to retain fine details while
mitigating unwanted artifacts. We introduce a benchmark dataset consisting of
240K natural images filtered for aesthetic quality and 18K 3D-rendered
synthetic images with metadata such as lighting, camera angles, and object
relationships. This dataset addresses the deficiencies of existing benchmarks
and allows a complete evaluation. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving feature-space
fidelity (FID 15.26) and semantic alignment (CLIP-S 32.85) while maintaining
competitive aesthetic quality. We also conducted a user study to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed work on unseen benchmark and observed a remarkable
improvement of $\sim25\%$, $\sim19\%$, $\sim13\%$, and $\sim14\%$ in terms of
prompt alignment, photorealism, the presence of AI artifacts, and natural
aesthetics over existing works.

Abstract: Human communication involves a complex interplay of verbal and nonverbal
signals, essential for conveying meaning and achieving interpersonal goals. To
develop socially intelligent AI technologies, it is crucial to develop models
that can both comprehend and generate dyadic behavioral dynamics. To this end,
we introduce the Seamless Interaction Dataset, a large-scale collection of over
4,000 hours of face-to-face interaction footage from over 4,000 participants in
diverse contexts. This dataset enables the development of AI technologies that
understand dyadic embodied dynamics, unlocking breakthroughs in virtual agents,
telepresence experiences, and multimodal content analysis tools. We also
develop a suite of models that utilize the dataset to generate dyadic motion
gestures and facial expressions aligned with human speech. These models can
take as input both the speech and visual behavior of their interlocutors. We
present a variant with speech from an LLM model and integrations with 2D and 3D
rendering methods, bringing us closer to interactive virtual agents.
Additionally, we describe controllable variants of our motion models that can
adapt emotional responses and expressivity levels, as well as generating more
semantically-relevant gestures. Finally, we discuss methods for assessing the
quality of these dyadic motion models, which are demonstrating the potential
for more intuitive and responsive human-AI interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算资源有限的情况下仍具有竞争力，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for
videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video
object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways.
First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens,
we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with
diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in
the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all
possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual
problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing
during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as
fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating
image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video
object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale
effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the
length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even
generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire
video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector
on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with
strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We
also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is
competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational
bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模图像-文本对数据，且图像模态和标准不统一，限制了通用基础模型的开发。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在290万生物医学图像-文本对上预训练，再从教师模型中提取1920万特征对进行特征级蒸馏。

Result: 在58个数据集上评估，涵盖1080万图像和9种模态，MMKD-CLIP在六类任务中均优于教师模型。

Conclusion: 多教师知识蒸馏是构建高性能生物医学基础模型的有效方法，适应实际数据限制。

Abstract: CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs
have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification,
cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring
this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale
biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and
fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the
development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained
from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical
foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation.
Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge
from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP
models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our
two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9
million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by
feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from
teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets,
encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities.
The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear
probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction,
and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models
while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image
domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher
knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building
high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of
real-world data availability.

Abstract: Agricultural image semantic segmentation is a pivotal component of modern
agriculture, facilitating accurate visual data analysis to improve crop
management, optimize resource utilization, and boost overall productivity. This
study proposes an efficient image segmentation method for precision
agriculture, focusing on accurately delineating farmland anomalies to support
informed decision-making and proactive interventions. A novel Dual Atrous
Separable Convolution (DAS Conv) module is integrated within the
DeepLabV3-based segmentation framework. The DAS Conv module is meticulously
designed to achieve an optimal balance between dilation rates and padding size,
thereby enhancing model performance without compromising efficiency. The study
also incorporates a strategic skip connection from an optimal stage in the
encoder to the decoder to bolster the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
spatial features. Despite its lower computational complexity, the proposed
model outperforms its baseline and achieves performance comparable to highly
complex transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Agriculture
Vision benchmark dataset. It achieves more than 66% improvement in efficiency
when considering the trade-off between model complexity and performance,
compared to the SOTA model. This study highlights an efficient and effective
solution for improving semantic segmentation in remote sensing applications,
offering a computationally lightweight model capable of high-quality
performance in agricultural imagery.

Motivation: 历史地图上的文本信息对研究至关重要，但现有方法难以有效链接文本片段，尤其是多词地名，且忽略了几何信息。

Method: LIGHT整合了语言、图像和几何特征，通过几何感知嵌入模块编码文本区域的多边形坐标，并结合LayoutLMv3的视觉和语言嵌入，使用双向学习策略预测文本实例的阅读顺序。

Result: LIGHT在ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText竞赛数据上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在历史地图文本链接中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history,
economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or
semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation,
reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and
transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the
recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing
layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding
in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and
neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To
address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that
integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on
historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding
module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture
polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies
this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from
LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal
information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance
directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence
robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods
on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.

TL;DR: BrainMT是一种新型混合框架，通过结合双向Mamba块和Transformer块，有效捕捉fMRI数据中的长距离时空依赖关系，在分类和回归任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CNN或Transformer）难以建模fMRI数据中的复杂时空关系，因此需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: BrainMT采用两阶段设计：1) 双向Mamba块捕捉全局时间依赖；2) Transformer块建模空间关系。

Result: 在UKBioBank和Human Connectome Project数据集上，BrainMT在分类和回归任务中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BrainMT通过高效学习长距离时空属性，为fMRI数据分析提供了新思路，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to predict phenotypic
measures directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain
volumes, sparking significant interest in the neuroimaging community. However,
existing approaches, primarily based on convolutional neural networks or
transformer architectures, often struggle to model the complex relationships
inherent in fMRI data, limited by their inability to capture long-range spatial
and temporal dependencies. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
BrainMT, a novel hybrid framework designed to efficiently learn and integrate
long-range spatiotemporal attributes in fMRI data. Our framework operates in
two stages: (1) a bidirectional Mamba block with a temporal-first scanning
mechanism to capture global temporal interactions in a computationally
efficient manner; and (2) a transformer block leveraging self-attention to
model global spatial relationships across the deep features processed by the
Mamba block. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets,
UKBioBank and the Human Connectome Project, demonstrate that BrainMT achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both classification (sex prediction) and
regression (cognitive intelligence prediction) tasks, outperforming existing
methods by a significant margin. Our code and implementation details will be
made publicly available at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习增强多模态模型在像素级任务（如COD和SOD）中的理解和推理能力。

Method: 引入Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)策略，通过点提示和边界框提示引导SAM2生成分割掩码，仅使用RL训练。

Result: 在COD10K上达到0.873 S-measure，在RefCOCOg和ReasonSeg上分别实现71.4 cIoU和56.7 gIoU的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 纯RL训练不仅在前景分割任务中表现优异，还具备强大的开放世界泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Seg-R1, a preliminary exploration of using reinforcement learning
(RL) to enhance the pixel-level understanding and reasoning capabilities of
large multimodal models (LMMs). Starting with foreground segmentation tasks,
specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection
(SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts
in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing
segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into
the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension
through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves
remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure
on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL
training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained
solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision,
Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and
reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on
ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.

*Sotirios Panagiotis Chytas,Miso Choi,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Vikas Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块ReCo，用于缓解视觉语言模型（VLM）中的幻觉问题，通过几何代数和关系组合的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）在生成文本时容易产生幻觉（即生成与视觉输入不符的文本），主要原因是模型对语言的过度依赖和视觉输入的‘记忆消退效应’。

Method: 提出了一种名为ReCo的小型可训练模块，基于几何代数和关系组合，无需修改现有VLM即可直接应用。

Result: 在InstructBLIP、LlaVA和MiniGPT4三种主流VLM上，ReCo模块显著缓解了记忆消退效应，并在多个基准测试中提升了性能。此外，ReCo还能与其他减少幻觉的方法结合，进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: ReCo模块是一种轻量且有效的解决方案，能够显著减少VLM中的幻觉问题，同时兼容其他方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and
reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A
common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e.,
generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or
at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an
over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model
suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual
input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled.
Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions,
we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any
VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module
is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used
VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on
multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with
many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve
improved results for each one.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散的数据集蒸馏方法在评估过程中存在目标不一致和条件不一致的问题，影响了性能。

Method: 提出CaO$_2$框架，分为两阶段：概率信息样本选择管道和潜在表示细化，以优化条件似然。

Result: 在ImageNet及其子集上实现了最先进的性能，平均准确率提升2.3%。

Conclusion: CaO$_2$通过解决不一致问题，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的效率和性能。

Abstract: The recent introduction of diffusion models in dataset distillation has shown
promising potential in creating compact surrogate datasets for large,
high-resolution target datasets, offering improved efficiency and performance
over traditional bi-level/uni-level optimization methods. However, current
diffusion-based dataset distillation approaches overlook the evaluation process
and exhibit two critical inconsistencies in the distillation process: (1)
Objective Inconsistency, where the distillation process diverges from the
evaluation objective, and (2) Condition Inconsistency, leading to mismatches
between generated images and their corresponding conditions. To resolve these
issues, we introduce Condition-aware Optimization with Objective-guided
Sampling (CaO$_2$), a two-stage diffusion-based framework that aligns the
distillation process with the evaluation objective. The first stage employs a
probability-informed sample selection pipeline, while the second stage refines
the corresponding latent representations to improve conditional likelihood.
CaO$_2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and its subsets,
surpassing the best-performing baselines by an average of 2.3% accuracy.

Result: LightBSR在多种盲超分辨率任务中表现出色，且模型复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: 优化IDR区分性是提升盲超分辨率模型性能的关键，LightBSR为轻量级模型设计提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Implicit degradation estimation-based blind super-resolution (IDE-BSR) hinges
on extracting the implicit degradation representation (IDR) of the LR image and
adapting it to LR image features to guide HR detail restoration. Although
IDE-BSR has shown potential in dealing with noise interference and complex
degradations, existing methods ignore the importance of IDR discriminability
for BSR and instead over-complicate the adaptation process to improve effect,
resulting in a significant increase in the model's parameters and computations.
In this paper, we focus on the discriminability optimization of IDR and propose
a new powerful and lightweight BSR model termed LightBSR. Specifically, we
employ a knowledge distillation-based learning framework. We first introduce a
well-designed degradation-prior-constrained contrastive learning technique
during teacher stage to make the model more focused on distinguishing different
degradation types. Then we utilize a feature alignment technique to transfer
the degradation-related knowledge acquired by the teacher to the student for
practical inferencing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IDR discriminability-driven BSR model design. The proposed LightBSR can achieve
outstanding performance with minimal complexity across a range of blind SR
tasks. Our code is accessible at: https://github.com/MJ-NCEPU/LightBSR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态点云中部分分割和运动估计的挑战，特别是在点云非固定采样或存在遮挡的情况下。

Method: 使用3D高斯模型表示物体，参数化时间依赖的旋转、平移和缩放，通过点与高斯模型的对应关系实现分割和运动估计。

Result: 在遮挡情况下，部分分割性能优于现有方法13%，且对缺失点更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态点云场景中表现优异，尤其在遮挡和非固定采样情况下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Part segmentation and motion estimation are two fundamental problems for
articulated object motion analysis. In this paper, we present a method to solve
these two problems jointly from a sequence of observed point clouds of a single
articulated object. The main challenge in our problem setting is that the point
clouds are not assumed to be generated by a fixed set of moving points.
Instead, each point cloud in the sequence could be an arbitrary sampling of the
object surface at that particular time step. Such scenarios occur when the
object undergoes major occlusions, or if the dataset is collected using
measurements from multiple sensors asynchronously. In these scenarios, methods
that rely on tracking point correspondences are not appropriate. We present an
alternative approach based on a compact but effective representation where we
represent the object as a collection of simple building blocks modeled as 3D
Gaussians. We parameterize the Gaussians with time-dependent rotations,
translations, and scales that are shared across all time steps. With our
representation, part segmentation can be achieved by building correspondences
between the observed points and the Gaussians. Moreover, the transformation of
each point across time can be obtained by following the poses of the assigned
Gaussian (even when the point is not observed). Experiments show that our
method outperforms existing methods that solely rely on finding point
correspondences. Additionally, we extend existing datasets to emulate
real-world scenarios by considering viewpoint occlusions. We further
demonstrate that our method is more robust to missing points as compared to
existing approaches on these challenging datasets, even when some parts are
completely occluded in some time-steps. Notably, our part segmentation
performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 13% on point clouds with
occlusions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于采样的6D姿态置信区域估计方法存在采样速度慢和置信区域过大的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用归纳共形预测校准高斯关键点分布为2D关键点置信区域，并通过隐函数定理直接传播到6D姿态置信区域。

Result: 在LineMOD Occlusion和SPEED数据集上，方法提高了姿态估计精度，计算时间减少，置信区域体积缩小99.9%（旋转）和99.8%（平移）。

Conclusion: 提出的确定性方法高效且准确，显著缩小置信区域，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: 6D pose confidence region estimation has emerged as a critical direction,
aiming to perform uncertainty quantification for assessing the reliability of
estimated poses. However, current sampling-based approach suffers from critical
limitations that severely impede their practical deployment: 1) the sampling
speed significantly decreases as the number of samples increases. 2) the
derived confidence regions are often excessively large. To address these
challenges, we propose a deterministic and efficient method for estimating pose
confidence regions. Our approach uses inductive conformal prediction to
calibrate the deterministically regressed Gaussian keypoint distributions into
2D keypoint confidence regions. We then leverage the implicit function theorem
to propagate these keypoint confidence regions directly into 6D pose confidence
regions. This method avoids the inefficiency and inflated region sizes
associated with sampling and ensembling. It provides compact confidence regions
that cover the ground-truth poses with a user-defined confidence level.
Experimental results on the LineMOD Occlusion and SPEED datasets show that our
method achieves higher pose estimation accuracy with reduced computational
time. For the same coverage rate, our method yields significantly smaller
confidence region volumes, reducing them by up to 99.9\% for rotations and
99.8\% for translations. The code will be available soon.

Conclusion: XTransfer为边缘系统上的人类感知任务提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems offers significant
opportunities for smart applications. However, its training and development are
hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of
edge systems. Current methods that rely on transferring pre-trained models
often encounter issues such as modality shift and high resource demands,
resulting in substantial accuracy loss, resource overhead, and poor
adaptability across different sensing applications. In this paper, we propose
XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method for resource-efficient, modality-agnostic
model transfer. XTransfer freely leverages single or multiple pre-trained
models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model
repairing that safely repairs modality shift in pre-trained model layers with
only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and
recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to
create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human
sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results
demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance on human
sensing tasks while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection,
model training, and edge deployment.

Motivation: 传统多模态医学图像融合方法依赖于高质量和对齐的输入图像，而在处理未对齐或退化的图像时效果不佳。UniFuse旨在解决这一问题。

Method: UniFuse通过退化感知提示学习模块和Omni统一特征表示方案（利用Spatial Mamba编码多方向特征），结合自适应LoRA协同网络（ALSN），实现单阶段的对齐、恢复和融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，UniFuse在多个数据集上表现出色，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniFuse通过统一框架实现了对齐、恢复和融合的联合优化，为多模态医学图像融合提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current multimodal medical image fusion typically assumes that source images
are of high quality and perfectly aligned at the pixel level. Its effectiveness
heavily relies on these conditions and often deteriorates when handling
misaligned or degraded medical images. To address this, we propose UniFuse, a
general fusion framework. By embedding a degradation-aware prompt learning
module, UniFuse seamlessly integrates multi-directional information from input
images and correlates cross-modal alignment with restoration, enabling joint
optimization of both tasks within a unified framework. Additionally, we design
an Omni Unified Feature Representation scheme, which leverages Spatial Mamba to
encode multi-directional features and mitigate modality differences in feature
alignment. To enable simultaneous restoration and fusion within an All-in-One
configuration, we propose a Universal Feature Restoration & Fusion module,
incorporating the Adaptive LoRA Synergistic Network (ALSN) based on LoRA
principles. By leveraging ALSN's adaptive feature representation along with
degradation-type guidance, we enable joint restoration and fusion within a
single-stage framework. Compared to staged approaches, UniFuse unifies
alignment, restoration, and fusion within a single framework. Experimental
results across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and
significant advantages over existing approaches.

Conclusion: JGAU显著提升了彩色点云的上采样质量，优于现有方法，适用于大规模3D应用。

Abstract: Colored point cloud, which includes geometry and attribute components, is a
mainstream representation enabling realistic and immersive 3D applications. To
generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep
learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method that
learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns while leveraging spatial
attribute correlations. First, we establish and release a large-scale dataset
for colored point cloud up-sampling called SYSU-PCUD, containing 121
large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute
complexities across six categories and four sampling rates. Second, to improve
the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU
framework that jointly up-samples geometry and attributes. It consists of a
geometry up-sampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the
latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood
correlations of the attributes. Third, we propose two coarse attribute
up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation
(GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate
coarse up-sampled attributes for each point. Then, an attribute enhancement
module is introduced to refine these up-sampled attributes and produce
high-quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and
geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that the Peak Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU method is 33.90 decibels, 32.10
decibels, 31.10 decibels, and 30.39 decibels for up-sampling rates of 4 times,
8 times, 12 times, and 16 times, respectively. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, JGAU achieves average PSNR gains of 2.32 decibels, 2.47 decibels, 2.28
decibels, and 2.11 decibels at these four up-sampling rates, demonstrating
significant improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法通过预训练模型和多路径设计，有效解决了金属透镜摄影中的退化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational
imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational
restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical
calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world
imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process
often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce
Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography,
leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of
large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths
to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and
suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside \textit{pseudo} data
augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity
and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware
attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced
degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for
real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image
reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Abstract: The development of generalist robot manipulation policies has seen
significant progress, driven by large-scale demonstration data across diverse
environments. However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world
demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing
simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the
challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges,
we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic
manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the
construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration
videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various
object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic
Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by
incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation
production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command
interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language
model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for
performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we
conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including
RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which
demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在视频超分辨率中的局限性（CNN的局部感受野和Transformer的二次复杂度），利用Mamba的长序列建模能力。

Method: 提出VSRM框架，包括空间-时间和时间-空间Mamba块、可变形交叉Mamba对齐模块，以及频率域Charbonnier-like损失函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: VSRM为未来研究提供了坚实基础，展示了Mamba在视频超分辨率中的潜力。

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks.
To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results.
However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers
struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long
sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence
modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we
propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution
framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces
Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract
long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently.
To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment
module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the
compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions.
Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and
ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency
Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances
visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art
results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Deepfake数据集未能真实反映攻击对人类感知的影响，需要更现实的攻击向量。

Method: 引入PF攻击方法，利用语言推理操纵语音片段，并开发了双层检测模型，自适应优先处理被操纵区域。

Result: PF攻击降低人类感知42%，基准准确率94%；检测模型降低EER 91%，速度提升90%。

Conclusion: PF攻击和检测模型为Deepfake攻击提供了更现实的评估和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake (DF) attacks pose a growing threat as generative models become
increasingly advanced. However, our study reveals that existing DF datasets
fail to deceive human perception, unlike real DF attacks that influence public
discourse. It highlights the need for more realistic DF attack vectors. We
introduce PhonemeFake (PF), a DF attack that manipulates critical speech
segments using language reasoning, significantly reducing human perception by
up to 42% and benchmark accuracies by up to 94%. We release an easy-to-use PF
dataset on HuggingFace and open-source bilevel DF segment detection model that
adaptively prioritizes compute on manipulated regions. Our extensive
experiments across three known DF datasets reveal that our detection model
reduces EER by 91% while achieving up to 90% speed-up, with minimal compute
overhead and precise localization beyond existing models as a scalable
solution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无检测器匹配框架的方法，用于直接匹配LiDAR点云和相机图像，解决了单帧LiDAR稀疏性和噪声问题，无需多帧累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云与相机图像之间的模态差异和单帧LiDAR稀疏性带来的匹配挑战。

Method: 将LiDAR强度图投影到2D视图，通过注意力机制的无检测器匹配网络直接估计跨模态对应关系，并引入重复性评分机制提高可靠性。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和MIAS-LCEC-TF70基准测试中表现优异，优于依赖多帧累积的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在单帧LiDAR条件下实现了最先进的性能，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a
fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception.
A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and
structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings.
Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and
images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate
encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,
these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often
requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.
Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.
MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the
detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and
camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view
from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free
matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without
relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,
we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility
prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with
low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive
experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds),
despite using only single-frame LiDAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次驾驶片段常导致道路结构扫描不完整，需要扩展重建以支持传感器模拟器有效回归驾驶行为。

Method: RGE-GS通过奖励网络选择性地保留扩散输出以确保空间稳定性，并采用差异化训练策略优化高斯积分。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RGE-GS在重建质量上达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: RGE-GS通过创新方法显著提升了重建质量和训练效率，代码将公开。

Abstract: A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS. (Camera-ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon.)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型因复杂性增加而导致的解释性不足问题，并实现模型与人类之间的相互理解。

Method: 利用概念瓶颈模型（CBM）作为可解释框架，通过全局梯度贡献识别和修正有害概念，并将修正后的知识蒸馏回黑盒模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，最高准确率提升2.64%，平均准确率提升1.03%。

Conclusion: CBM-HNMU有效提升了模型的解释性和性能，为深度学习模型的可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to increasingly complex models with
deeper layers and more parameters, reducing interpretability and making their
decisions harder to understand. While many methods explain black-box reasoning,
most lack effective interventions or only operate at sample-level without
modifying the model itself. To address this, we propose the Concept Bottleneck
Model for Enhancing Human-Neural Network Mutual Understanding (CBM-HNMU).
CBM-HNMU leverages the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) as an interpretable
framework to approximate black-box reasoning and communicate conceptual
understanding. Detrimental concepts are automatically identified and refined
(removed/replaced) based on global gradient contributions. The modified CBM
then distills corrected knowledge back into the black-box model, enhancing both
interpretability and accuracy. We evaluate CBM-HNMU on various CNN and
transformer-based models across Flower-102, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft,
and CUB-200, achieving a maximum accuracy improvement of 2.64% and a maximum
increase in average accuracy across 1.03%. Source code is available at:

Conclusion: CPE能有效擦除目标概念并保护其他概念，具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion models has brought a major
concern about potentially generating images on inappropriate or trademarked
concepts. Concept erasing has been investigated with the goals of deleting
target concepts in diffusion models while preserving other concepts with
minimal distortion. To achieve these goals, recent concept erasing methods
usually fine-tune the cross-attention layers of diffusion models. In this work,
we first show that merely updating the cross-attention layers in diffusion
models, which is mathematically equivalent to adding \emph{linear} modules to
weights, may not be able to preserve diverse remaining concepts. Then, we
propose a novel framework, dubbed Concept Pinpoint Eraser (CPE), by adding
\emph{nonlinear} Residual Attention Gates (ResAGs) that selectively erase (or
cut) target concepts while safeguarding remaining concepts from broad
distributions by employing an attention anchoring loss to prevent the
forgetting. Moreover, we adversarially train CPE with ResAG and learnable text
embeddings in an iterative manner to maximize erasing performance and enhance
robustness against adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the erasure of
celebrities, artistic styles, and explicit contents demonstrated that the
proposed CPE outperforms prior arts by keeping diverse remaining concepts while
deleting the target concepts with robustness against attack prompts. Code is

Motivation: 解决脑电图（EEG）在情绪识别中因个体差异导致的跨被试泛化问题。

Method: 结合频率自适应处理（FAP）、自适应动态图学习（ADGL）和多尺度时间解缠网络（MTDN）。

Result: 实验证明FreqDGT显著提高了跨被试情绪识别的准确性。

Conclusion: FreqDGT通过频率、空间和时间建模的整合，有效解决了跨被试情绪识别的挑战。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a reliable and objective signal for
emotion recognition in affective brain-computer interfaces, offering unique
advantages through its high temporal resolution and ability to capture
authentic emotional states that cannot be consciously controlled. However,
cross-subject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual
variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a
frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses
these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces
frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant
frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic
graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and
implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines
hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to
capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves
cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of
integrating frequency-adaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical
modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences. The code is

Method: MVOV3D利用CLIP编码器提取精确的区域级图像和文本特征，并结合3D几何先验优化多视图融合。

Conclusion: MVOV3D通过减少噪声和优化多视图融合，显著提升了开放词汇3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Recent open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding approaches mainly focus on
training 3D networks through contrastive learning with point-text pairs or by
distilling 2D features into 3D models via point-pixel alignment. While these
methods show considerable performance in benchmarks with limited vocabularies,
they struggle to handle diverse object categories as the limited amount of 3D
data upbound training strong open-vocabulary 3d models. We observe that 2D
multi-view fusion methods take precedence in understanding diverse concepts in
3D scenes. However, inherent noises in vision-language models lead multi-view
fusion to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we introduce MVOV3D, a novel
approach aimed at unleashing the potential of 2D multi-view fusion for
open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. We focus on reducing the inherent
noises without training, thereby preserving the generalizability while
enhancing open-world capabilities. Specifically, MVOV3D improves multi-view 2D
features by leveraging precise region-level image features and text features
encoded by CLIP encoders and incorporates 3D geometric priors to optimize
multi-view fusion. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Notably, our MVOV3D achieves a new record with
14.7% mIoU on ScanNet200 and 16.2% mIoU on Matterport160 for challenge
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, outperforming current leading trained 3D

<details>

Motivation: 当前TPT方法在提升准确率的同时导致置信度校准下降，限制了其在关键应用中的适用性。

Method: 1. 使用大型语言模型（LLM）初始化提示以减少过拟合；2. 提出正则化损失以减少类内距离并增加类间距离。

Result: 在15个数据集上，方法TCA的平均ECE为4.11，显著优于其他TPT方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效改善了TPT后的校准性能，为关键应用提供了更可靠的模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive performance in
image recognition by leveraging self-supervised training on large datasets.
Their performance can be further improved by adapting to the test sample using
test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Unfortunately, the singular focus of TPT
approaches on improving the accuracy suffers from tunnel vision, and leads to
degradation in confidence calibration. This limits the applicability of TPT in
critical applications.
  We make three contributions in this work. (1) We posit that random or naive
initialization of prompts leads to overfitting on a particular test sample, and
is the main reason for miscalibration of the VLM after TPT. To mitigate the
problem, we propose careful initialization of test time prompt using prior
knowledge about the target label attributes from a large language model (LLM);
(2) To further maintain the quality of prompts during \tpt, we propose a novel
regularization loss to reduce intraclass distance, and increase inter-class
distance between the learnt
  Through extensive experiments on different CLIP architectures and 15
datasets, we show that our approach can effectively improve the calibration
after TPT. We report an average expected calibration error (ECE) of 4.11 with
our method, TCA, compared to 11.7 for vanilla TPT, 6.12 for C-TPT (ICLR'24),
6.78 for DiffTPT (CVPR'23), and 8.43 for PromptAlign (NeurIPS'23). The code is

Motivation: 当前奖励模型在泛化性和推理准确性上表现不佳，需要复杂标注流程。强化学习（如GRPO）虽能改善泛化性，但在推理链与独立视觉语言模型不一致时，准确性会显著下降。

Conclusion: 听众增强的奖励机制为视觉语言模型与人类偏好的对齐提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences
is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models
with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and
supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation
pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure
mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning
trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model
("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a
listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the
reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score,
shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer
correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent
model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the
ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6%
over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong
GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards
provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with
nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here:

Motivation: 现有3D感知GAN技术虽然提供多视角一致性，但缺乏局部编辑能力，因此需要一种能够精确控制面部语义的方法。

Method: SemFaceEdit通过几何模块和外观模块联合训练，生成语义辐射和占用场，并利用潜在代码解耦几何与外观。

Conclusion: SemFaceEdit为面部图像的局部编辑提供了一种高效且精确的解决方案，显著提升了语义控制的灵活性。

Abstract: Despite multiple view consistency offered by 3D-aware GAN techniques, the
resulting images often lack the capacity for localized editing. In response,
generative radiance manifolds emerge as an efficient approach for constrained
point sampling within volumes, effectively reducing computational demands and
enabling the learning of fine details. This work introduces SemFaceEdit, a
novel method that streamlines the appearance and geometric editing process by
generating semantic fields on generative radiance manifolds. Utilizing latent
codes, our method effectively disentangles the geometry and appearance
associated with different facial semantics within the generated image. In
contrast to existing methods that can change the appearance of the entire
radiance field, our method enables the precise editing of particular facial
semantics while preserving the integrity of other regions. Our network
comprises two key modules: the Geometry module, which generates semantic
radiance and occupancy fields, and the Appearance module, which is responsible
for predicting RGB radiance. We jointly train both modules in adversarial
settings to learn semantic-aware geometry and appearance descriptors. The
appearance descriptors are then conditioned on their respective semantic latent
codes by the Appearance Module, facilitating disentanglement and enhanced
control. Our experiments highlight SemFaceEdit's superior performance in
semantic field-based editing, particularly in achieving improved radiance field
disentanglement.

Abstract: Pedestrian attribute recognition (PAR) is a fundamental perception task in
intelligent transportation and security. To tackle this fine-grained task, most
existing methods focus on extracting regional features to enrich attribute
information. However, a regional feature is typically used to predict a fixed
set of pre-defined attributes in these methods, which limits the performance
and practicality in two aspects: 1) Regional features may compromise
fine-grained patterns unique to certain attributes in favor of capturing common
characteristics shared across attributes. 2) Regional features cannot
generalize to predict unseen attributes in the test time. In this paper, we
propose the \textbf{F}ine-grained \textbf{O}ptimization with semanti\textbf{C}
g\textbf{U}ided under\textbf{S}tanding (FOCUS) approach for PAR, which
adaptively extracts fine-grained attribute-level features for each attribute
individually, regardless of whether the attributes are seen or not during
training. Specifically, we propose the Multi-Granularity Mix Tokens (MGMT) to
capture latent features at varying levels of visual granularity, thereby
enriching the diversity of the extracted information. Next, we introduce the
Attribute-guided Visual Feature Extraction (AVFE) module, which leverages
textual attributes as queries to retrieve their corresponding visual attribute
features from the Mix Tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. To ensure that
textual attributes focus on the appropriate Mix Tokens, we further incorporate
a Region-Aware Contrastive Learning (RACL) method, encouraging attributes
within the same region to share consistent attention maps. Extensive
experiments on PA100K, PETA, and RAPv1 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
and strong generalization ability of our method.

Motivation: 解决网格去噪问题，提出一种高效且鲁棒的深度学习方法。

Method: 使用图卷积神经网络（GCN）和双流网络（primal-dual fusion block），结合特征引导变换器（FGT）提取局部特征并去噪。

Result: 在大规模3D数据集上训练，性能优于现有方法，对高噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DMD-Net在网格去噪任务中表现出色，各组件对性能至关重要。

Abstract: We present Deep Mesh Denoising Network (DMD-Net), an end-to-end deep learning
framework, for solving the mesh denoising problem. DMD-Net consists of a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network in which aggregation is performed in both the
primal as well as the dual graph. This is realized in the form of an asymmetric
two-stream network, which contains a primal-dual fusion block that enables
communication between the primal-stream and the dual-stream. We develop a
Feature Guided Transformer (FGT) paradigm, which consists of a feature
extractor, a transformer, and a denoiser. The feature extractor estimates the
local features, that guide the transformer to compute a transformation, which
is applied to the noisy input mesh to obtain a useful intermediate
representation. This is further processed by the denoiser to obtain the
denoised mesh. Our network is trained on a large scale dataset of 3D objects.
We perform exhaustive ablation studies to demonstrate that each component in
our network is essential for obtaining the best performance. We show that our
method obtains competitive or better results when compared with the
state-of-the-art mesh denoising algorithms. We demonstrate that our method is
robust to various kinds of noise. We observe that even in the presence of
extremely high noise, our method achieves excellent performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Mask-aware TIR（MaTIR）任务，结合文本到图像检索（TIR）和参考表达式分割（RES），提出两阶段框架，利用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP实现高效检索与分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TIR方法缺乏解释性，RES方法在大规模图像集上计算成本高，需结合两者优势。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段用SAM 2和Alpha-CLIP离线生成掩码和区域嵌入；第二阶段用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）重排序和定位。

Result: 在COCO和D$^3$数据集上，检索准确率和分割质量显著提升。

Conclusion: MaTIR任务和两阶段框架有效结合了TIR和RES，提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (TIR) aims to find relevant images based on a textual
query, but existing approaches are primarily based on whole-image captions and
lack interpretability. Meanwhile, referring expression segmentation (RES)
enables precise object localization based on natural language descriptions but
is computationally expensive when applied across large image collections. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Mask-aware TIR (MaTIR), a new task that unifies
TIR and RES, requiring both efficient image search and accurate object
segmentation. To address this task, we propose a two-stage framework,
comprising a first stage for segmentation-aware image retrieval and a second
stage for reranking and object grounding with a multimodal large language model
(MLLM). We leverage SAM 2 to generate object masks and Alpha-CLIP to extract
region-level embeddings offline at first, enabling effective and scalable
online retrieval. Secondly, MLLM is used to refine retrieval rankings and
generate bounding boxes, which are matched to segmentation masks. We evaluate
our approach on COCO and D$^3$ datasets, demonstrating significant improvements
in both retrieval accuracy and segmentation quality over previous methods.

Result: 在工业缺陷数据集上验证了方法的优越性，实现了高精度分割。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了弱监督学习与高精度分割之间的差距，适用于资源受限的工业场景。

Abstract: Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality
inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly
enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional
semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect
detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic
segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class
activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of
existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient
detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP),
which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas
with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a
region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally,
pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance
iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively
bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect
segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial
scenarios.

TL;DR: STR-Match是一种无需训练的视频编辑算法，通过新的STR分数优化潜在空间，解决了现有方法在时间一致性、运动失真和领域转换方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导视频编辑方法存在时间不一致、运动失真和领域转换受限的问题，主要原因是时空像素相关性建模不足。

Method: 提出STR-Match算法，利用2D空间注意力和1D时间模块计算STR分数，结合潜在优化框架和潜在掩码生成视频。

Result: 实验表明，STR-Match在视觉质量和时空一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在显著领域转换时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: STR-Match通过高效建模时空相关性，显著提升了视频编辑的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal
inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain
transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of
spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we
propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces
visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent
optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal
pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and
1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the
overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into
a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates
temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong
performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key
visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and
spatiotemporal consistency.

Motivation: 现有方法（如Sa2VA）直接将特征融合到分割模型中，导致动态视觉信息与静态语义纠缠，降低分割精度。

Method: 1. 设计预训练范式，将文本标签转换为点级提示并生成文本掩码；2. 使用线性投影将隐藏状态解耦为文本和视觉特征子空间；3. 动态掩码融合策略结合解耦特征。

Conclusion: DeSa2VA通过解耦和动态融合显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing video segmenter and grounder approaches, exemplified by Sa2VA,
directly fuse features within segmentation models. This often results in an
undesirable entanglement of dynamic visual information and static semantics,
thereby degrading segmentation accuracy. To systematically mitigate this issue,
we propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text
pre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information
processing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a
pre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into
point-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are
refined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic
grounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden
states that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and
visual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy
synergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision
from predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks,
including image segmentation, image question answering, video segmentation, and
video question answering. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对比学习的语义信息度量方法，用于量化图像和文本的绝对语义信息量，并重新定义了信息增益的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对比学习是否能表示绝对语义信息量，而不仅仅是关系语义相似性。

Method: 通过对比学习模型计算图像和文本的信息增益，并基于嵌入的范数度量信息增益。

Result: 实验结果显示信息增益与嵌入范数强相关（R²为0.98-1.00），且低信息增益图像多为占位图标。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适用于公开模型，为跨模态语义信息量化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has the capacity to model multimodal probability
distributions by embedding and aligning visual representations with semantics
from captions. This approach enables the estimation of relational semantic
similarity; however, it remains unclear whether it can also represent absolute
semantic informativeness. In this work, we introduce a semantic informativeness
metric for an image calculated from text samples via a contrastive learning
model; similarly, the informativeness of a text is calculated from image
samples. We propose a redefinition of the concept of Information Gain, a
concept previously explored in natural language processing, extending its
application to the domains of vision and language. Our metric quantifies how
conditioning on an image distorts the distribution of associated texts, and
vice versa for text conditioning on image distributions. In OpenCLIP's
empirical results, we observe that images with the lowest Information Gain
scores often correspond to placeholder icons such as "image not found."
Furthermore, we propose to measure a norm-based metric of the embedding to
estimate the Information Gain, following the theoretical results for Skip-Gram
with Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding. Information Gain can be measured
using either CLIP or SigLIP, and the results demonstrate a strong correlation
with a coefficient of determination ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. After obtaining
the mean and the covariance of the sample embedding, the computational cost of
this method is independent of the sample size, and it is compatible with
publicly available, open-weight models.

Method: 提出PASAC方法采样验证共识，定义CCLoss捕捉差异，动态调整阈值。

Result: 实验证明CP-Guard能有效检测并消除恶意代理。

Conclusion: CP-Guard为协作感知提供了可靠的安全防御方案。

Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been shown to be a promising technique for
multi-agent autonomous driving and multi-agent robotic systems, where multiple
agents share their perception information to enhance the overall perception
performance and expand the perception range. However, in CP, an ego agent needs
to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to
attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a
unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which
is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately
detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key
idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego
agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a
probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a
subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior
probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative
consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV)
segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its
collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In
addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to
dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the
reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code
will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCA在低分辨率网格上表现良好，但在高分辨率下因计算和内存需求剧增、信息传播受限而难以扩展。

Result: 实现了实时生成高清输出，保持了自组织和涌现特性，且计算高效并行。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了NCA的应用范围，适用于多种任务和网格类型，显著提升了质量和效率。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical
cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly
applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including
self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and
spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and
morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This
limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow
quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information
which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands
of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this
limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by
recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on
a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary
resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and
texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with
minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture
and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and
performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD
outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent
properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently,
inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the
applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids,
and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and
morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed
framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal
computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有方法在医学视觉问答中常生成错误答案或检索无关上下文，忽视了多模态信息的重要性。

Method: MOTOR利用基于文本和视觉信息的检索重排序方法，结合最优传输理论，提升检索相关性。

Result: MOTOR在MedVQA数据集上平均准确率提升6.45%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTOR通过多模态检索和重排序显著提升了医学视觉问答的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (MedVQA) plays a vital role in clinical
decision-making by providing contextually rich answers to image-based queries.
Although vision-language models (VLMs) are widely used for this task, they
often generate factually incorrect answers. Retrieval-augmented generation
addresses this challenge by providing information from external sources, but
risks retrieving irrelevant context, which can degrade the reasoning
capabilities of VLMs. Re-ranking retrievals, as introduced in existing
approaches, enhances retrieval relevance by focusing on query-text alignment.
However, these approaches neglect the visual or multimodal context, which is
particularly crucial for medical diagnosis. We propose MOTOR, a novel
multimodal retrieval and re-ranking approach that leverages grounded captions
and optimal transport. It captures the underlying relationships between the
query and the retrieved context based on textual and visual information.
Consequently, our approach identifies more clinically relevant contexts to
augment the VLM input. Empirical analysis and human expert evaluation
demonstrate that MOTOR achieves higher accuracy on MedVQA datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.45%. Code is
available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MOTOR.

Despite notable progress, challenges such as enhancing visual fidelity,
reducing latency, and supporting multimodal data remain. This survey outlines

Result: 实验表明，MagShield显著提高了磁干扰下的动作捕捉准确性，并与多种系统兼容。

Conclusion: MagShield有效解决了磁干扰问题，提升了稀疏惯性动作捕捉系统的实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method called MagShield, designed to address the
issue of magnetic interference in sparse inertial motion capture (MoCap)
systems. Existing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) systems are prone to
orientation estimation errors in magnetically disturbed environments, limiting
their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address this problem,
MagShield employs a "detect-then-correct" strategy, first detecting magnetic
disturbances through multi-IMU joint analysis, and then correcting orientation
errors using human motion priors. MagShield can be integrated with most
existing sparse inertial MoCap systems, improving their performance in
magnetically disturbed environments. Experimental results demonstrate that
MagShield significantly enhances the accuracy of motion capture under magnetic
interference and exhibits good compatibility across different sparse inertial
MoCap systems.

Method: 提出数据白化技术，对图像块嵌入和键/查询投影器进行去相关和方差均衡化，并引入低秩分解的双线性提示调优（BPT）方法。

Conclusion: BPT方法通过优化数据分布和低秩分解，有效解决了VPT中的非高斯性问题，显著提升了提示调优的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is a parameter-efficient fune-tuning technique
that adapts a pre-trained vision Transformer (ViT) by learning a small set of
parameters in the input space, known as prompts. In VPT, we uncover
``burstiness'' in the values arising from the interaction of image patch
embeddings, and the key and query projectors within Transformer's
self-attention module. Furthermore, the values of patch embeddings and the key
and query projectors exhibit Laplacian and hyper-Laplacian distribution,
respectively. Intuitively, these non-Gaussian distributions pose challenges for
learning prompts. To address this, we propose whitening these data,
de-correlating them and equalizing their variance towards more Gaussian before
learning prompts. We derive the whitening matrix over random image patch
embeddings and ViT's key and query projectors, and multiply it with the prompt
to be learned in a bilinear manner. Surprisingly, this method significantly
accelerates prompt tuning and boosts accuracy, e.g., $>$25 accuracy points on
the CUB dataset; interestingly, it learns ``bursty prompts''. Extending the
bilinear model which is known to introduce burstiness, we present a compact,
low-rank version by learning two smaller matrices whose multiplication yields
the final prompts. We call the proposed methods Bilinear Prompt Tuning (BPT).
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPT
methods not only outperform various VPT methods but also reduce parameter count
and computation overhead.

Abstract: The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more
subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are
frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such
content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies
that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We
introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs
region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection,
and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support
generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements
model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench,
a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing
real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic
manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance
interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in
classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in
explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic,

attention-based segmentation head for precise and accurate segmentation. To
address class imbalance, we introduce the Weighted Multi-class Exponential
(WME) loss function. On the ACDC dataset, YM-WML achieves a Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 91.02, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The model
demonstrates stable training, accurate segmentation, and strong generalization,
setting a new benchmark in cardiac segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 欧盟预测到2026年90%的在线内容可能是AI生成的，引发对政治虚假信息的担忧。加州AB 3211法案要求对AI生成内容加水印，但现有技术易被篡改。本文提出PECCAVI，一种抗视觉改写攻击的无失真水印技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对AI生成内容的水印易被篡改问题，尤其是视觉改写攻击。

Method: PECCAVI通过在多通道频域嵌入水印，并利用噪声打磨技术保护水印。

Result: PECCAVI能有效抵抗视觉改写攻击，且不影响图像质量。

Conclusion: PECCAVI为AI生成内容提供了一种安全、无失真的水印解决方案。

Abstract: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026,
up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising
concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a
force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of
generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any
single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the
watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns
remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to
tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely.
Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced
visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks,
resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI,
the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking
technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving
its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI
strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel
frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter
reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded
watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All
relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

*Amir Aghdam,Vincent Tao Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActAlign是一种零样本视频分类框架，通过序列对齐和语言先验实现细粒度动作分类，无需视频文本监督或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本细粒度视频分类任务，现有对比视觉语言模型无法捕捉关键的时间结构。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成有序子动作序列，通过动态时间规整（DTW）在共享嵌入空间对齐视频帧。

Result: 在ActionAtlas基准测试中达到30.5%准确率，优于十亿参数视频语言模型且参数更少。

Conclusion: 结合结构化语言先验和经典对齐技术，可扩展地释放视觉语言模型在细粒度视频理解中的潜力。

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot fine-grained video classification, where no
video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen action classes.
While contrastive vision-language models such as SigLIP demonstrate strong
open-set recognition via mean-pooled image-text similarity, they fail to
capture the temporal structure critical for distinguishing fine-grained
activities. We introduce ActAlign, a zero-shot framework that formulates video
classification as sequence alignment. For each class, a large language model
generates an ordered sub-action sequence, which is aligned with video frames
using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any
video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on the
extremely challenging ActionAtlas benchmark, where human accuracy is only
61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using
approximately 8x less parameters. These results demonstrate that structured
language priors, combined with classical alignment techniques, offer a scalable
and general approach to unlocking the open-set recognition potential of
vision-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FewCLIP提出了一种概率原型校准框架，通过多模态原型学习提升广义少样本语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有确定性原型方法在少样本标注下适应性不足的问题。

Method: 引入原型校准机制和分布正则化，优化多模态原型学习。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FewCLIP通过概率原型校准提升了少样本分割的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) aims to extend a
segmentation model to novel classes with only a few annotated examples while
maintaining performance on base classes. Recently, pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP have been leveraged in GFSS to improve
generalization on novel classes through multi-modal prototypes learning.
However, existing prototype-based methods are inherently deterministic,
limiting the adaptability of learned prototypes to diverse samples,
particularly for novel classes with scarce annotations. To address this, we
propose FewCLIP, a probabilistic prototype calibration framework over
multi-modal prototypes from the pretrained CLIP, thus providing more adaptive
prototype learning for GFSS. Specifically, FewCLIP first introduces a prototype
calibration mechanism, which refines frozen textual prototypes with learnable
visual calibration prototypes, leading to a more discriminative and adaptive
representation. Furthermore, unlike deterministic prototype learning
techniques, FewCLIP introduces distribution regularization over these
calibration prototypes. This probabilistic formulation ensures structured and
uncertainty-aware prototype learning, effectively mitigating overfitting to
limited novel class data while enhancing generalization. Extensive experimental
results on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed
FewCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across both GFSS
and class-incremental setting. The code is available at

Result: 改进方法显著提升攻击成功率，验证了CroPA的优越性，并在多个VLMs上表现一致。

Conclusion: 研究强调了VLMs对抗攻击的脆弱性，提供了更鲁棒的对抗样本生成框架，对实际应用安全有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized computer vision,
enabling tasks such as image classification, captioning, and visual question
answering. However, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly in scenarios where both visual and textual modalities can be
manipulated. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of
"An Image is Worth 1000 Lies: Adversarial Transferability Across Prompts on
Vision-Language Models" validating the Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) and
confirming its superior cross-prompt transferability compared to existing
baselines. Beyond replication we propose several key improvements: (1) A novel
initialization strategy that significantly improves Attack Success Rate (ASR).
(2) Investigate cross-image transferability by learning universal
perturbations. (3) A novel loss function targeting vision encoder attention
mechanisms to improve generalization. Our evaluation across prominent VLMs --
including Flamingo, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP as well as extended experiments on
LLaVA validates the original results and demonstrates that our improvements
consistently boost adversarial effectiveness. Our work reinforces the
importance of studying adversarial vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a more
robust framework for generating transferable adversarial examples, with
significant implications for understanding the security of VLMs in real-world
applications.

Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current
state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed
Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant

Abstract: VisionScores presents a novel proposal being the first system-segmented image
score dataset, aiming to offer structure-rich, high information-density images
for machine and deep learning tasks. Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it
was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition
patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides
two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed
by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition
type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples,
presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author,
being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as
grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the
users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces'
metadata. Moreover, unsegmented full-page scores and the pre-formatted images

Motivation: 医学数据集的像素级标注成本高且耗时，如何在标注数据稀缺的情况下提升分割性能是关键挑战。

Method: AugPaint利用潜在扩散模型进行修复生成图像-标签对，无需重新训练，确保合成图像与标签掩码的匹配准确性。

Result: 在四个公共医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，AugPaint优于现有方法，显著提升分割性能。

Conclusion: AugPaint通过高效生成图像-标签对，解决了标注数据稀缺问题，为下游分割模型提供了有价值的监督。

Abstract: Collecting pixel-level labels for medical datasets can be a laborious and
expensive process, and enhancing segmentation performance with a scarcity of
labeled data is a crucial challenge. This work introduces AugPaint, a data
augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs
from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known
for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead,
and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for
retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the
area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising
process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled
in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach
ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting
it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve
as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models,
effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted
extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical
image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results
across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art
label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation
performance.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射方法在训练和渲染时产生过多高斯基元，导致内存和带宽压力。

Method: 使用可学习的离散小波变换，固定低通滤波器，学习高通滤波器，并通过正交性损失逐步激活高频细节。

Result: AutoOpti3DGS仅需一个超参数，生成更稀疏的场景表示，适用于内存受限硬件。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少高斯增殖，提升3D高斯溅射的效率和兼容性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful approach in novel view
synthesis, delivering rapid training and rendering but at the cost of an
ever-growing set of Gaussian primitives that strains memory and bandwidth. We
introduce AutoOpti3DGS, a training-time framework that automatically restrains
Gaussian proliferation without sacrificing visual fidelity. The key idea is to
feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete
Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters
are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss
gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine
process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to
capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through
extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate
hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,
and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with
memory or storage-constrained hardware.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model
that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image
editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1
incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token
refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like
GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation
tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a
language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation
tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the
enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score
of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent
state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In
text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the
DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves
4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the
initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries
of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出DyME训练范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，以提升小规模视觉语言模型的思维可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模视觉语言模型（SVLMs）因参数容量有限和指令跟随能力弱，难以实现可靠思维。现有训练范式（如SFT和RLVR）对模型要求过高，导致伪思维痕迹和优势崩溃。

Method: 提出DyME范式，动态选择记忆（SFT）和探索（RLVR）模式，确保每次优化更新均有助于平衡。

Result: 实验表明DyME能有效平衡记忆与探索，显著提升SVLMs的性能。

Conclusion: DyME是一种实用且有效的解决方案，可增强SVLMs的可靠思维能力。

Abstract: Empowering Small-scale Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) with reliable thinking
capabilities remains fundamentally challenging due to their limited parameter
capacity and weak instruction-following abilities. Existing training paradigms,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding
the capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to
SVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,
ultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A
natural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity
to reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted
two-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency
toward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of
the combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm
that Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via
RLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes
to the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that
DyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial
performance improvements. These results establish DyME as a practical and
effective solution for empowering SVLMs with reliable thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years,
yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness,
generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding
paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel
segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during
transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the
CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically,
CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters
with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By
modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the
selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a
general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can
adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the
embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation
indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across
multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves
significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera
attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.

Conclusion: CDAL通过最大化因果效应，鼓励网络捕捉泛化性强的生成模式，为开放世界模型归属提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Counterfactually Decoupled Attention Learning
(CDAL) method for open-world model attribution. Existing methods rely on
handcrafted design of region partitioning or feature space, which could be
confounded by the spurious statistical correlations and struggle with novel
attacks in open-world scenarios. To address this, CDAL explicitly models the
causal relationships between the attentional visual traces and source model
attribution, and counterfactually decouples the discriminative model-specific
artifacts from confounding source biases for comparison. In this way, the
resulting causal effect provides a quantification on the quality of learned
attention maps, thus encouraging the network to capture essential generation
patterns that generalize to unseen source models by maximizing the effect.
Extensive experiments on existing open-world model attribution benchmarks show
that with minimal computational overhead, our method consistently improves
state-of-the-art models by large margins, particularly for unseen novel
attacks. Source code: https://github.com/yzheng97/CDAL.

Conclusion: DyCL框架在跨视角地理定位中表现出色，为解决复杂空间关系问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based cross-view geo-localization methods primarily
focus on improving the accuracy of cross-domain image matching, rather than
enabling models to comprehensively capture contextual information around the
target and minimize the cost of localization errors. To support systematic
research into this Distance-Aware Cross-View Geo-Localization (DACVGL) problem,
we construct Distance-Aware Campus (DA-Campus), the first benchmark that pairs
multi-view imagery with precise distance annotations across three spatial
resolutions. Based on DA-Campus, we formulate DACVGL as a hierarchical
retrieval problem across different domains. Our study further reveals that, due
to the inherent complexity of spatial relationships among buildings, this
problem can only be addressed via a contrastive learning paradigm, rather than
conventional metric learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Dynamic
Contrastive Learning (DyCL), a novel framework that progressively aligns
feature representations according to hierarchical spatial margins. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DyCL is highly complementary to existing
multi-scale metric learning methods and yields substantial improvements in both
hierarchical retrieval performance and overall cross-view geo-localization
accuracy. Our code and benchmark are publicly available at

Abstract: Automated and accurate segmentation of individual vertebra in 3D CT and MRI
images is essential for various clinical applications. Due to the limitations
of current imaging techniques and the complexity of spinal structures, existing
methods still struggle with reducing the impact of image blurring and
distinguishing similar vertebrae. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a
Frequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the
accuracy of vertebrae segmentation. Specifically, we first apply wavelet
transform for lossless downsampling to reduce the feature distortion in blurred
images. The decomposed high and low-frequency components are then processed
separately. For the high-frequency components, we apply a High-frequency
Feature Refinement (HFR) to amplify the prominence of key features and filter
out noises, restoring fine-grained details in blurred images. For the
low-frequency components, we use a Multi-granularity State Space Model (MG-SSM)
to aggregate feature representations with different receptive fields,
extracting spatially-varying contexts while capturing long-range dependencies
with linear complexity. The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is
essential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on both CT and MRI vertebrae segmentation datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的驾驶员注意力预测任务范式（W3DA），结合了空间注意力区域预测、语义解析和认知推理，并提出了LLada框架进行端到端建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅预测驾驶员注视的空间热图，未能捕捉注意力分配的认知动机，限制了对其机制的深入理解。

Method: 引入W3DA数据集，提供详细的语义和因果标注；提出LLada框架，统一像素建模、语义解析和认知推理。

Result: LLada在多个数据集和驾驶条件下表现出鲁棒的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解驾驶员注意力机制提供了关键步骤，对自动驾驶等领域有重要意义。

Abstract: Modeling task-driven attention in driving is a fundamental challenge for both
autonomous vehicles and cognitive science. Existing methods primarily predict
where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the
cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which
limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that
jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics
(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To
support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver
attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and
causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal
conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further
propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention
prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive
reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets
and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper
understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for
autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer
interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-TTA是一种新的测试时适应框架，通过用户交互监督改进SAM在复杂场景中的表现，显著优于零样本SAM和传统TTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在专业领域或复杂场景（如伪装或多部分对象）中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: DC-TTA将用户交互划分为更一致的子集，每个子集通过独立的TTA模型处理，减少冲突并实现局部更新，最后合并模型。

Result: DC-TTA在多个基准测试中显著优于SAM的零样本结果和传统TTA方法，减少了交互次数并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: DC-TTA通过分而治之策略有效解决了SAM在复杂任务中的局限性，提升了交互分割的性能。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) allows users to iteratively refine object
boundaries with minimal cues, such as positive and negative clicks. While the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered attention in the IS community for its
promptable segmentation capabilities, it often struggles in specialized domains
or when handling complex scenarios (e.g., camouflaged or multi-part objects).
To overcome these challenges, we propose DC-TTA, a novel test-time adaptation
(TTA) framework that adapts SAM on a per-sample basis by leveraging user
interactions as supervision. Instead of forcing a single model to incorporate
all user clicks at once, DC-TTA partitions the clicks into more coherent
subsets, each processed independently via TTA with a separated model. This
Divide-and-Conquer strategy reduces conflicts among diverse cues and enables
more localized updates. Finally, we merge the adapted models to form a unified
predictor that integrates the specialized knowledge from each subset.
Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that DC-TTA
significantly outperforms SAM's zero-shot results and conventional TTA methods,
effectively handling complex tasks such as camouflaged object segmentation with
fewer interactions and improved accuracy.

Motivation: 多笔画汉字对非母语学习者构成挑战，简化这些字符可以降低学习障碍，优化字体设计，并提升字符通信系统的效率。

Method: 使用高精度字符识别模型评估可读性，选择性移除对可读性影响最小的笔画。

Result: 实验表明，即使移除多个笔画，许多字符仍可区分，为更正式的简化策略提供了可能性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了简化多笔画汉字的潜力，为未来研究和应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Multi-stroke characters in scripts such as Chinese and Japanese can be highly
complex, posing significant challenges for both native speakers and,
especially, non-native learners. If these characters can be simplified without
degrading their legibility, it could reduce learning barriers for non-native
speakers, facilitate simpler and legible font designs, and contribute to
efficient character-based communication systems. In this paper, we propose a
framework to systematically simplify multi-stroke characters by selectively
removing strokes while preserving their overall legibility. More specifically,
we use a highly accurate character recognition model to assess legibility and
remove those strokes that minimally impact it. Experimental results on 1,256
character classes with 5, 10, 15, and 20 strokes reveal several key findings,
including the observation that even after removing multiple strokes, many
characters remain distinguishable. These findings suggest the potential for
more formalized simplification strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在多视图分类中忽略了表示学习和类别特征的差异，导致CPG任务性能不足。

Method: 提出CVC-RF框架，结合中心记忆对比损失、级联下采样注意力模块和无参数专家混合加权策略，实现多级特征优化。

Result: CVC-RF在CPG任务中表现优异，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CVC-RF通过多级细化有效建模全局特征，为CPG任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate carotid plaque grading (CPG) is vital to assess the risk of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the small size and high
intra-class variability of plaque, CPG is commonly evaluated using a
combination of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound views in clinical
practice. However, most existing deep learning-based multi-view classification
methods focus on feature fusion across different views, neglecting the
importance of representation learning and the difference in class features. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Corpus-View-Category Refinement
Framework (CVC-RF) that processes information from Corpus-, View-, and
Category-levels, enhancing model performance. Our contribution is four-fold.
First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the foremost deep learning-based
method for CPG according to the latest Carotid Plaque-RADS guidelines. Second,
we propose a novel center-memory contrastive loss, which enhances the network's
global modeling capability by comparing with representative cluster centers and
diverse negative samples at the Corpus level. Third, we design a cascaded
down-sampling attention module to fuse multi-scale information and achieve
implicit feature interaction at the View level. Finally, a parameter-free
mixture-of-experts weighting strategy is introduced to leverage class
clustering knowledge to weight different experts, enabling feature decoupling
at the Category level. Experimental results indicate that CVC-RF effectively
models global features via multi-level refinement, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in the challenging CPG task.

TL;DR: MoCa是一个两阶段框架，将预训练的因果视觉语言模型（VLMs）转化为高效的双向多模态嵌入模型，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入模型存在三个主要问题：因果注意力不适用于嵌入任务、依赖高质量标注数据导致扩展性差、训练目标和数据多样性不足。

Method: MoCa分为两个阶段：1）模态感知持续预训练，通过联合重建目标增强双向上下文推理；2）异构对比微调，利用多样化多模态数据提升泛化和对齐能力。

Result: MoCa在MMEB和ViDoRe-v2基准测试中表现优异，达到新的SOTA结果，并在模型规模和训练数据上展现出强扩展性。

Conclusion: MoCa通过双向注意力、大规模无标签数据和多样化训练目标，显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs),
have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key
limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for
embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled
paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training
objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage
framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional
multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual
Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously
denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional
context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive
Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple
image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method
addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through
continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via
joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for
enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa
consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks,
achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with
both model size and training data on MMEB.

Method: R²S框架模仿人类认知过程，将空间推理分为两个阶段：先识别相关元素，再基于视觉先验处理指令。同时，提出了3D ReasonSeg数据集。

Result: 实验表明，R²S和3D ReasonSeg显著提升了3D点云感知的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: R²S和3D ReasonSeg为未来工作提供了新的基准和数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud perception have demonstrated remarkable
progress in scene understanding through vision-language alignment leveraging
large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods may still encounter
challenges in handling complex instructions that require accurate spatial
reasoning, even if the 3D point cloud data provides detailed spatial cues such
as size and position for identifying the targets. To tackle this issue, we
propose Relevant Reasoning Segmentation (R$^2$S), a reasoning-based
segmentation framework. The framework emulates human cognitive processes by
decomposing spatial reasoning into two sequential stages: first identifying
relevant elements, then processing instructions guided by their associated
visual priors. Furthermore, acknowledging the inadequacy of existing datasets
in complex reasoning tasks, we introduce 3D ReasonSeg, a reasoning-based
segmentation dataset comprising 25,185 training samples and 3,966 validation
samples with precise annotations. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that the R$^2$S and 3D ReasonSeg effectively endow 3D point cloud
perception with stronger spatial reasoning capabilities, and we hope that they
can serve as a new baseline and benchmark for future work.

Conclusion: 讨论了方法优缺点，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'
copyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in
forensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
plagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving
visually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a
dataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions
using generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a
baseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model
DINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify
plagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned
method achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\% but suffers from low
retrieval precision 29.0\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval
quality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and
negative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly
improves retrieval performance by 12\% AP over the baseline, though it
unexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\%). We conclude with
insightful discussions and outline directions for future research.

Abstract: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence,
serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos
while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied
world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D
geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for
contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified
physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and
physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key
physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances
3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning
that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material
characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and
physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its
practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy
training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new
insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance
embodied intelligence research. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有提示工程方法虽能增强图像风格和美学，但常忽略语义对齐，导致生成图像内容不满足用户需求。

Result: 在多个文本-图像对齐评估基准上达到新最优性能，且框架设计为即插即用，适配多种生成模型。

Conclusion: VisualPrompter有效解决了语义对齐问题，提升了生成图像的质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Since there exists a notable gap between user-provided and model-preferred
prompts, generating high-quality and satisfactory images using diffusion models
often requires prompt engineering to optimize user inputs. Current studies on
text-to-image prompt engineering can effectively enhance the style and
aesthetics of generated images. However, they often neglect the semantic
alignment between generated images and user descriptions, resulting in visually
appealing but content-wise unsatisfying outputs. In this work, we propose
VisualPrompter, a novel training-free prompt engineering framework that refines
user inputs to model-preferred sentences. In particular, VisualPrompter
utilizes an automatic self-reflection module to identify the missing concepts
in generated images and a target-specific prompt optimization mechanism to
revise the prompts in a fine-grained manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our VisualPrompter, which achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks for text-image alignment evaluation.
Additionally, our framework features a plug-and-play design, making it highly
adaptable to various generative models.

TL;DR: AlignCVC提出了一种通过分布对齐而非严格回归损失的单图像到3D生成框架，显著提升了跨视图一致性（CVC）和生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中，预训练生成模型合成的中间多视图图像缺乏跨视图一致性（CVC），严重影响3D重建性能。现有方法通过反馈重建结果改进CVC，但受限于噪声和不稳定的输出。

Method: AlignCVC通过分布对齐将生成和重建的多视图分布与真实多视图分布对齐，提出软-硬对齐策略，分别优化生成和重建模型。

Result: 实验表明，AlignCVC不仅提升了生成质量，还将推理加速至仅需4步，且能无缝集成多种多视图生成与3D重建模型。

Conclusion: AlignCVC为单图像到3D生成提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image-to-3D models typically follow a sequential generation and
reconstruction workflow. However, intermediate multi-view images synthesized by
pre-trained generation models often lack cross-view consistency (CVC),
significantly degrading 3D reconstruction performance. While recent methods
attempt to refine CVC by feeding reconstruction results back into the
multi-view generator, these approaches struggle with noisy and unstable
reconstruction outputs that limit effective CVC improvement. We introduce
AlignCVC, a novel framework that fundamentally re-frames single-image-to-3D
generation through distribution alignment rather than relying on strict
regression losses. Our key insight is to align both generated and reconstructed
multi-view distributions toward the ground-truth multi-view distribution,
establishing a principled foundation for improved CVC. Observing that generated
images exhibit weak CVC while reconstructed images display strong CVC due to
explicit rendering, we propose a soft-hard alignment strategy with distinct
objectives for generation and reconstruction models. This approach not only
enhances generation quality but also dramatically accelerates inference to as
few as 4 steps. As a plug-and-play paradigm, our method, namely AlignCVC,
seamlessly integrates various multi-view generation models with 3D
reconstruction models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of AlignCVC for single-image-to-3D generation.

Method: 通过优化RAFT类架构的设计选择，减少相关体积并采用高分辨率训练协议，结合多帧估计，实现内存高效的光流估计。

Result: MEMFOF在多个基准测试中表现优异，内存消耗显著降低（运行时2.09GB，训练时28.5GB），并在Spring、Sintel和KITTI-2015上排名第一。

Conclusion: MEMFOF在高分辨率光流估计中实现了内存效率和性能的平衡，优于资源密集型方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the
cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution
(FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical
flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame
estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU
memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely
positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for
cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from
RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and
high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially
reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive
alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness
for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method
ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289,
leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the

Conclusion: DDR方法有效解决了小相机运动场景下的几何表示和相机参数问题，提升了新视角合成的质量。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis for dynamic $3$D scenes poses a significant challenge.
Many notable efforts use NeRF-based approaches to address this task and yield
impressive results. However, these methods rely heavily on sufficient motion
parallax in the input images or videos. When the camera motion range becomes
limited or even stationary (i.e., small camera motion), existing methods
encounter two primary challenges: incorrect representation of scene geometry
and inaccurate estimation of camera parameters. These challenges make prior
methods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To
address the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth
Regularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align
with the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use
depth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the
expectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample
points from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce
constraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object
boundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the
correct geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a
visualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at
the rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera
parameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to
camera parameters. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representing scenes with small camera motion
input, and our results compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has demonstrated its effectiveness in learning
representations through comparison methods that align with human intuition.
However, mainstream SSL methods heavily rely on high body datasets with single
label, such as ImageNet, resulting in intolerable pre-training overhead.
Besides, more general multi-label images are frequently overlooked in SSL,
despite their potential for richer semantic information and broader
applicability in downstream scenarios. Therefore, we tailor the mainstream SSL
approach to guarantee excellent representation learning capabilities using
fewer multi-label images. Firstly, we propose a block-wise augmentation module
aimed at extracting additional potential positive view pairs from multi-label
images. Subsequently, an image-aware contrastive loss is devised to establish
connections between these views, thereby facilitating the extraction of
semantically consistent representations. Comprehensive linear fine-tuning and
transfer learning validate the competitiveness of our approach despite
challenging sample quality and quantity.

Abstract: High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with
rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous
spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified
representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal
features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm
fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame
imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.
To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various
latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between
background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate
for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting
framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we
figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in
frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal
features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between
background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that
Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal
characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal
disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the
cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal
discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous
dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 当前城市研究方法局限于特定数据类型，缺乏统一框架，而多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出UrbanLLaVA模型，构建多样化的城市指令数据集，并设计多阶段训练框架，分离空间推理增强与领域知识学习。

Result: 实验表明，UrbanLLaVA在单模态和跨模态任务中均优于开源和专有MLLMs，并展现出跨城市的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UrbanLLaVA为城市研究提供了一个高效的多模态处理框架，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the
understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data
types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them
comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this
paper, we introduce $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model
designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong
performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In
$\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset
encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from
location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a
multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement
from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and
downstream performance of $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.
Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results
from three cities demonstrate that $\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms
open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex
cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.

Conclusion: Trident通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，显著提升了人脸伪造检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为数字媒体完整性保护提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As face forgeries generated by deep neural networks become increasingly
sophisticated, detecting face manipulations in digital media has posed a
significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maintaining digital media
integrity and combating visual disinformation. Current detection models,
predominantly based on supervised training with domain-specific data, often
falter against forgeries generated by unencountered techniques. In response to
this challenge, we introduce \textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection
framework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for
enhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \textit{Trident} is
trained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,
capturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from
manipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance
generalizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery
discriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards
forgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen
manipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head
to the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to
certain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will
release our code in a GitHub repository.

Motivation: 解决transformer模型在行人搜索任务中高频特征抑制和计算成本高的问题。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: HAMW方法有效提升了行人搜索任务的性能，同时降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: The person search task aims to locate a target person within a set of scene
images. In recent years, transformer-based models in this field have made some
progress. However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the
self-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the
features, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost
of transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel
High-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person
search. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction
capabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and
improving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that
progressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our
model enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from
augmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,
we replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based
on multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not
only lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of
high-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BridgeShape提出了一种基于潜在扩散Schrödinger桥的3D形状补全框架，通过最优传输路径和深度增强的VQ-VAE编码，解决了现有方法在全局一致性和分辨率限制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的3D形状补全方法未能显式建模最优全局传输路径，且受限于体素空间的分辨率约束，导致补全效果不佳。

Method: BridgeShape将形状补全建模为最优传输问题，并引入深度增强的VQ-VAE编码3D形状到紧凑潜在空间，结合多视角深度信息和DINOv2特征增强几何感知。

Result: BridgeShape在大规模3D形状补全基准测试中达到最优性能，支持更高分辨率和未见物体类别的补全。

Conclusion: BridgeShape通过显式建模最优传输路径和高效潜在空间操作，显著提升了3D形状补全的全局一致性和细节生成能力。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based 3D shape completion methods typically use a
conditional paradigm, injecting incomplete shape information into the denoising
network via deep feature interactions (e.g., concatenation, cross-attention) to
guide sampling toward complete shapes, often represented by voxel-based
distance functions. However, these approaches fail to explicitly model the
optimal global transport path, leading to suboptimal completions. Moreover,
performing diffusion directly in voxel space imposes resolution constraints,
limiting the generation of fine-grained geometric details. To address these
challenges, we propose BridgeShape, a novel framework for 3D shape completion
via latent diffusion Schr\"odinger bridge. The key innovations lie in two
aspects: (i) BridgeShape formulates shape completion as an optimal transport
problem, explicitly modeling the transition between incomplete and complete
shapes to ensure a globally coherent transformation. (ii) We introduce a
Depth-Enhanced Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode 3D
shapes into a compact latent space, leveraging self-projected multi-view depth
information enriched with strong DINOv2 features to enhance geometric
structural perception. By operating in a compact yet structurally informative
latent space, BridgeShape effectively mitigates resolution constraints and
enables more efficient and high-fidelity 3D shape completion. BridgeShape
achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale 3D shape completion
benchmarks, demonstrating superior fidelity at higher resolutions and for
unseen object classes.

TL;DR: TVG-SLAM是一种基于3D高斯散射的RGB-only SLAM系统，通过三视图几何和混合几何约束提高了跟踪和映射的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-only SLAM系统在无边界户外环境中因依赖光度渲染损失而鲁棒性不足。

Method: 引入三视图匹配模块和混合几何约束，结合概率初始化策略和动态衰减渲染信任机制。

Result: 在多个户外数据集上表现优异，显著降低轨迹误差（ATE降低69.0%），并实现高质量渲染。

Conclusion: TVG-SLAM在鲁棒性和渲染质量上优于现有RGB-only 3DGS SLAM系统，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled RGB-only SLAM
systems to achieve high-fidelity scene representation. However, the heavy
reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking
undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with
severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we
propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel
tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality
mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable
pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust
geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric
Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary
geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose
estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For
mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes
geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized
Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust
mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on
multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior
RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our
method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory
Error (ATE) by 69.0\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. The
implementation of our method will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is critical in clinical
settings to prevent serious complications. While CT imaging remains the
standard diagnostic tool, the growing number of cases can overwhelm
radiologists, potentially causing delays. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning model that leverages 3D CT scans for appendicitis classification,
incorporating Slice Attention mechanisms guided by external 2D datasets to
enhance small lesion detection. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical
classification framework using pre-trained 2D models to differentiate between
simple and complicated appendicitis. Our approach improves AUC by 3% for
appendicitis and 5.9% for complicated appendicitis, offering a more efficient
and reliable diagnostic solution compared to previous work.

Conclusion: 通过多模态和区域一致性方法，本文成功解决了场景级标注下点云分割的伪标签生成问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates indoor point cloud semantic segmentation under
scene-level annotation, which is less explored compared to methods relying on
sparse point-level labels. In the absence of precise point-level labels,
current methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used
to train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for
each point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable
challenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to
enhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation
framework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point
semantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,
our method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with
corresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.
To further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we
introduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional
semantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,
which are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.
Leveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate
point-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality
pseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and
S3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our
approach's individual components. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表面网格模型在处理几何实体交互时效率低，现有体积神经隐式模型要么鲁棒性不足，要么计算成本高。

Result: 比COAP快10倍，GPU内存使用降低6倍，精度更高，支持SDF高效建模。

Conclusion: VolumetricSMPL在多项任务中表现优异，具有广泛适用性和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Parametric human body models play a crucial role in computer graphics and
vision, enabling applications ranging from human motion analysis to
understanding human-environment interactions. Traditionally, these models use
surface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with
other geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as
meshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has
explored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are
either insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high
computational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we
introduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural
Blend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of
learned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,
significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving
expressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model
COAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,
and a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact
modeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging
tasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,
(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)
scene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections. Our
results highlight its broad applicability and significant performance and
efficiency gains.

<details>

Motivation: 深度学习在图像分类中表现优异，但模型预测的解释仍具挑战性。现有方法要么过于局部（如显著性图），要么过于简化全局方法，难以捕捉重要局部行为。

Method: 提出SATs方法，利用图像片段（如“眼睛”）和显著性图量化其影响，总结局部显著性解释为半全局见解。

Result: SATs能揭示模型依赖的概念和虚假相关性（如背景或水印），即使测试性能变化不大。

Conclusion: SATs填补了过于简化的全局总结和过于详细的局部解释之间的空白，为分析和调试图像分类器提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how
models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on
local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which
visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However,
reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is
infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local
behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a
method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights.
SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency
maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model
relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance
on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance
sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of
saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named
segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and
overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and
debugging image classifiers.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has highlighted
the importance of robust and efficient object detection in diverse aerial
scenarios. Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a
significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed,
leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address
this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed
to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a
dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the
model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic
representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism
that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace
the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate
information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone
Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV
object detection tasks.

Conclusion: PixelBoost在图像超分辨率的真实性和计算效率上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a
trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This
issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps,
resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the
significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing
image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly
focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled
stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence
to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty
of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior
objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity
(LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR),
structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To
determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel
value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction
capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities
by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal
noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference
speeds.

Conclusion: 多模态整合在生成全面且行为感知的视频摘要方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The increasing volume of video content in educational, professional, and
social domains necessitates effective summarization techniques that go beyond
traditional unimodal approaches. This paper proposes a behaviour-aware
multimodal video summarization framework that integrates textual, audio, and
visual cues to generate timestamp-aligned summaries. By extracting prosodic
features, textual cues and visual indicators, the framework identifies
semantically and emotionally important moments. A key contribution is the
identification of bonus words, which are terms emphasized across multiple
modalities and used to improve the semantic relevance and expressive clarity of
the summaries. The approach is evaluated against pseudo-ground truth (pGT)
summaries generated using LLM-based extractive method. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional extractive method, such
as the Edmundson method, in both text and video-based evaluation metrics.
Text-based metrics show ROUGE-1 increasing from 0.4769 to 0.7929 and BERTScore
from 0.9152 to 0.9536, while in video-based evaluation, our proposed framework
improves F1-Score by almost 23%. The findings underscore the potential of
multimodal integration in producing comprehensive and behaviourally informed
video summaries.

TL;DR: PCLVis框架通过MPI通信数据分析通信延迟事件，帮助用户优化大规模模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超级计算机上大规模模拟的通信延迟问题，现有方法依赖管理员才能获取的物理链路层信息。

Method: 1. 空间PCL事件定位；2. 构建通信依赖DAG分析传播路径；3. 设计CS-Glyph展示通信状态；4. 提出PCL事件归因策略。

Result: 在TH-1A超级计算机上验证了框架有效性，显著提升模拟效率。

Conclusion: PCLVis为普通用户提供了一种无需物理链路层信息的通信延迟分析工具，优化模拟性能。

Abstract: Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for
users. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge
communication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication
latency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is
only available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is
proposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)
events. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI
process communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event
locating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are
classified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.
Second, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a
communication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help
users interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a
located PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is
designed to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called
the communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show
its communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each
leaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL
event attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their
simulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by
analyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A
supercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解交通事故的因果关系对自动驾驶汽车的安全至关重要，但将真实视频中的因果关系融入合成视频仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出Causal-VidSyn扩散模型，利用原因描述和驾驶员注视点识别事故参与者和行为，辅以事故原因回答和注视条件选择模块。

Result: Causal-VidSyn在帧质量和因果敏感性方面优于现有视频扩散模型，支持多种任务如事故视频编辑和文本到视频生成。

Conclusion: Causal-VidSyn通过结合因果关系和驾驶员注视点，显著提升了合成交通事故视频的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Egocentricly comprehending the causes and effects of car accidents is crucial
for the safety of self-driving cars, and synthesizing causal-entity reflected
accident videos can facilitate the capability test to respond to unaffordable
accidents in reality. However, incorporating causal relations as seen in
real-world videos into synthetic videos remains challenging. This work argues
that precisely identifying the accident participants and capturing their
related behaviors are of critical importance. In this regard, we propose a
novel diffusion model, Causal-VidSyn, for synthesizing egocentric traffic
accident videos. To enable causal entity grounding in video diffusion,
Causal-VidSyn leverages the cause descriptions and driver fixations to identify
the accident participants and behaviors, facilitated by accident reason
answering and gaze-conditioned selection modules. To support Causal-VidSyn, we
further construct Drive-Gaze, the largest driver gaze dataset (with 1.54M
frames of fixations) in driving accident scenarios. Extensive experiments show
that Causal-VidSyn surpasses state-of-the-art video diffusion models in terms
of frame quality and causal sensitivity in various tasks, including accident
video editing, normal-to-accident video diffusion, and text-to-video
generation.

*Yi Li,Hualiang Wang,Xinpeng Ding,Haonan Wang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Token Activation Map (TAM)的方法，通过因果推理和高斯滤波减少多模态大语言模型(MLLM)解释中的冗余激活干扰，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM的可解释性研究不足，冗余激活干扰影响解释可靠性，阻碍模型理解和可视化。

Method: 采用估计因果推理和高斯滤波，提出TAM方法，解决上下文冗余激活问题。

Result: TAM在多任务中表现优异，如目标定位、失败案例分析和视频可视化等。

Conclusion: TAM显著提升了MLLM的可解释性和可视化质量，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are broadly empowering various
fields. Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less
explored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective
visualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that
produce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,
where each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier
context tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the
explanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies
often overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant
correlations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address
this, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the
interference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel
rank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method
Token Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions
between tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens
of MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single
prediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,
showcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various
scenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video
visualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,
shape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc). The

Abstract: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning
within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and
acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions.
At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory
system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists
of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a
spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By
integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves
relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social
relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent
beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a
dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and
are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental
results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents
well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through
observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative
potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for
advancing embodied intelligence. More videos can be found at

Motivation: 解决传统方法在适应预训练Transformer模型到视听任务时内存消耗大、训练时间长的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级的Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)模块并行蒸馏每层Transformer的特征为元标记，结合Meta-Token Injection (MTI)模块支持细粒度分割任务。

Result: 在多个视听基准测试中显著减少内存使用和训练时间，同时保持参数效率和竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: Mettle是一种高效且内存友好的方法，适用于多种视听任务。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Met}a-\textbf{T}oken \textbf{Le}arning (Mettle), a simple
and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer
models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the
output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a
lightweight \textit{Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD)} module to distill in
parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer
into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained
knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens
can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event
localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained
segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a
\textit{Meta-Token Injection (MTI)} module, which utilizes the audio and visual
meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature
adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and
training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: AutoT2IS为解决文本到图像集生成问题提供了有效方案，具有广泛的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Text-to-Image models, many real-world
applications require generating coherent image sets with diverse consistency
requirements. Existing consistent methods often focus on a specific domain with
specific aspects of consistency, which significantly constrains their
generalizability to broader applications. In this paper, we propose a more
challenging problem, Text-to-ImageSet (T2IS) generation, which aims to generate
sets of images that meet various consistency requirements based on user
instructions. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce
$\textbf{T2IS-Bench}$ with 596 diverse instructions across 26 subcategories,
providing comprehensive coverage for T2IS generation. Building on this, we
propose $\textbf{T2IS-Eval}$, an evaluation framework that transforms user
instructions into multifaceted assessment criteria and employs effective
evaluators to adaptively assess consistency fulfillment between criteria and
generated sets. Subsequently, we propose $\textbf{AutoT2IS}$, a training-free
framework that maximally leverages pretrained Diffusion Transformers'
in-context capabilities to harmonize visual elements to satisfy both
image-level prompt alignment and set-level visual consistency. Extensive
experiments on T2IS-Bench reveal that diverse consistency challenges all
existing methods, while our AutoT2IS significantly outperforms current
generalized and even specialized approaches. Our method also demonstrates the
ability to enable numerous underexplored real-world applications, confirming
its substantial practical value. Visit our project in

Result: 实验表明，该方法在运动理解和生成任务中表现优异，同时保持了强大的语言能力。

Conclusion: MotionGPT3为自回归框架下的双模态运动扩散建模提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Though recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated strong
capabilities and opportunities in unified understanding and generation, the
development of unified motion-language models remains underexplored. To enable
such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be
addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion
modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the
second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training.
Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal
motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling
motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective
cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve
language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and
parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is
integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information
flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this
continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly
from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete
tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive
performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving
strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion
framework within an autoregressive manner.

Conclusion: 通过综合考虑场景、运动和外观三个差距，提出的方法能够更全面地检测视频中的异常。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks
to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based
paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and
detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods
are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned
distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps
uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,
we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score
matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function
by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and
assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input
sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate
unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score
matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting
intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the
corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original
data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an
enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all
three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator.
Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of our method.

Conclusion: MoMa框架有效解决了视频理解中的时空建模问题，兼具高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Video understanding is a complex challenge that requires effective modeling
of spatial-temporal dynamics. With the success of image foundation models
(IFMs) in image understanding, recent approaches have explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to adapt IFMs for video. However, most
of these methods tend to process spatial and temporal information separately,
which may fail to capture the full intricacy of video dynamics. In this paper,
we propose MoMa, an efficient adapter framework that achieves full
spatial-temporal modeling by integrating Mamba's selective state space modeling
into IFMs. We propose a novel SeqMod operation to inject spatial-temporal
information into pre-trained IFMs, without disrupting their original features.
By incorporating SeqMod into a Divide-and-Modulate architecture, MoMa enhances
video understanding while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MoMa,
achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have significantly advanced the field of computer
vision. To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods
demonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing
a fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In
this context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,
e.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve
generic training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of
multiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to
the poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks
across different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive
distillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as
a teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.
Competitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task
and engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to
improve the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic
perturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce
mutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum. The
experimental results show that competitive distillation achieves promising
performance in diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC have exacerbated the misuse of malicious deepfake
content, making the development of reliable deepfake detection methods an
essential means to address this challenge. Although existing deepfake detection
models demonstrate outstanding performance in detection metrics, most methods
only provide simple binary classification results, lacking interpretability. In
critical domains such as law, interpretability is crucial for enhancing the
credibility and authority of decisions. Recent studies attempt to improve the
interpretability of classification results by providing spatial manipulation
masks or temporal forgery segments. However, the practical effectiveness of
these methods remains suboptimal due to limitations of the forgery data. Most
current deepfake datasets predominantly offer binary labels, only a few
datasets with localization annotations. However, they suffer from restricted
forgery scenarios, limited diversity in deepfake types, and insufficient data
scale, making them inadequate for complex real-world scenarios. To address this
predicament, we construct a novel large-scale deepfake detection and
localization ($\textbf{DDL}$) dataset containing over $\textbf{1.8M}$ forged
samples and encompassing up to $\textbf{75}$ distinct deepfake methods. The DDL
design incorporates four key innovations: (1) $\textbf{Diverse Forgery
Scenarios}$, (2) $\textbf{Comprehensive Deepfake Methods}$, (3) $\textbf{Varied
Manipulation Modes}$, and (4) $\textbf{Fine-grained Forgery Annotations}$.
Through these improvements, our DDL not only provides a more challenging
benchmark for complex real-world forgeries, but also offers crucial support for
building next-generation deepfake detection, localization, and interpretability
methods. The DDL dataset project page is on

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion.
While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved
visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained
garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining
inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To
address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent
diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a
progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware
garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained
deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via
a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,
the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality
rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit
effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and
visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as
textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the
human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate
that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of soft tissue is crucial for advancing automation in
image-guided robotic surgery. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic
surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in
scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure.
Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization
problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we
present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive
Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven
lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively
models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware
enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a
spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness
adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior
rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while
maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control
loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for
illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that
Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art
reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments,
underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications. Our

Result: 在PASCAL VOC、PASCAL Context和COCO Object基准测试中达到43.8%的平均mIoU，表现最优且推理高效。

Conclusion: FastSeg为开放词汇语义分割提供了高质量和高效率的解决方案，并具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from
arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.
Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they
often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation
bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial
features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local
details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the number of
iterations with the quality of the segmentation. In this work, we propose
FastSeg, a novel and efficient training-free framework with only (1+1)-step of
reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FastSeg
performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the
segmentation quality, FastSeg introduces three key components: (i) a
dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction,
(ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances fused
cross-attention using scale-aligned selfattention maps, and (iii) a Test-Time
Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive
experiments show that FastSeg achieves state-of-the-art training-free
performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context,
and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that FastSeg provides a strong foundation for
extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference
efficiency.

TL;DR: IR3D-Bench是一个新的基准测试，旨在通过主动创建而非被动识别来评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的场景理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在描述性任务上表现优异，但其是否真正理解视觉场景尚不明确。

Method: 基于分析-合成范式，IR3D-Bench要求视觉语言代理（VLAs）使用编程和渲染工具主动重建输入图像的3D结构。

Result: 初步实验显示，现有VLMs在视觉精度方面存在局限，而非基本工具使用。

Conclusion: IR3D-Bench为系统性研究和开发工具使用的VLAs提供了数据和评估协议，以促进真正的场景理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they
truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We
introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding
through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the
analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs)
with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying
3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through
tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using
generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational

*Yi Liu,Shengqian Li,Zuzeng Lin,Feng Wang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CycleVAR的新方法，通过Softmax Relaxed Quantization解决传统量化方法在图像翻译中的梯度传播问题，并在无监督图像翻译任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件自回归图像生成方法在无监督图像翻译领域潜力未充分挖掘，传统量化方法阻碍了端到端优化。

Method: 提出Softmax Relaxed Quantization保持梯度传播，并设计CycleVAR，通过多尺度源图像标记作为上下文提示，实现图像条件自回归生成。

Result: 并行一步生成模式在无监督场景下表现更优，CycleVAR超越现有方法如CycleGAN-Turbo。

Conclusion: CycleVAR通过改进量化方法和生成模式，显著提升了无监督图像翻译的性能和效率。

Abstract: The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown
promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the
practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without
explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the
discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based
frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder
decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during
adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using
Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook
selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby
preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,
we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as
image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale
source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based
conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the
target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling
iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation
synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental
findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior
translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step
mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative
results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised
image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.

<details>

Motivation: 现有3D语言方法在小规模环境中表现良好，但缺乏处理大规模复杂城市环境的能力。

Method: 提出GeoProg3D框架，包含地理感知的城市规模3D语言场（GCLF）和地理视觉API（GV-APIs），利用大语言模型动态组合工具。

Result: 在GeoEval3D基准测试中，GeoProg3D在多项任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoProg3D首次实现了通过自然语言在城市规模3D环境中进行组合地理推理。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with
3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically
limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional
reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome
these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that
enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D
scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware
City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient
hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic
information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues,
distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii)
Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as
area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language
models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate
GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess
performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging
tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.
Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D
language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our
knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic
reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language. The

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了红外图像低对比度问题，提升了自动驾驶感知性能。

Abstract: Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous
driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light.
However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in
non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the
performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving
contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information
remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented
infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components:
layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an
layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details
while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent
saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological
reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and
enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the
image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单主体场景，缺乏多主体训练数据和对控制信号（如深度、遮罩等）的利用。

Method: 提出了VideoCus-Factory数据构造管道和IVTM混合训练框架，结合扩散Transformer框架OmniVCus及其嵌入机制（LE和TAE）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在多主体视频定制和控制信号利用方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study
single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject
training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals
such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject
in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose
a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs
for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control
signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our
constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with
image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the
customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus,
with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned
Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training
subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation
process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by
assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SIEDD是一种新型架构，通过共享编码器和离散解码器设计，显著加速隐式神经表示（INR）的视频编码速度，同时保持重建质量和压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR编码速度过慢，且加速方法常牺牲重建质量或坐标级控制能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: SIEDD采用共享编码器快速捕捉全局低频特征，再并行训练轻量级离散解码器，结合坐标空间采样加速。

Result: 在HD和4K基准测试中，SIEDD实现了20-30倍的编码加速，同时保持竞争性重建质量和压缩比。

Conclusion: SIEDD显著提升了高保真神经视频压缩的实用性，为实际部署提供了可扩展且高效的路径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) offer exceptional fidelity for video
compression by learning per-video optimized functions, but their adoption is
crippled by impractically slow encoding times. Existing attempts to accelerate
INR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level
control essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD
(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that
fundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first
rapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to
efficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then
frozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders
for individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space
sampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding
speed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.
Critically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous
resolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding. Our approach
significantly advances the practicality of high-fidelity neural video
compression, demonstrating a scalable and efficient path towards real-world
deployment. Our codebase is available at

Abstract: Smartphone-based heart rate (HR) monitoring apps using finger-over-camera
photoplethysmography (PPG) face significant challenges in performance
evaluation and device compatibility due to device variability and
fragmentation. Manual testing is impractical, and standardized methods are
lacking. This paper presents a novel, high-throughput bench-testing platform to
address this critical need. We designed a system comprising a test rig capable
of holding 12 smartphones for parallel testing, a method for generating
synthetic PPG test videos with controllable HR and signal quality, and a host
machine for coordinating video playback and data logging. The system achieved a
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.11% +/- 0.001% between input and
measured HR, and a correlation coefficient of 0.92 +/- 0.008 between input and
measured PPG signals using a clinically-validated smartphone-based HR app.
Bench-testing results of 20 different smartphone models correctly classified
all the devices as meeting the ANSI/CTA accuracy standards for HR monitors
(MAPE <10%) when compared to a prospective clinical study with 80 participants,
demonstrating high positive predictive value. This platform offers a scalable
solution for pre-deployment testing of smartphone HR apps to improve app
performance, ensure device compatibility, and advance the field of mobile
health.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在生成复杂空间关系时表现不佳，需要更准确的评估和生成方法。

Method: 提出了PoS框架，包括评估指标PSE和生成方法PSG，后者通过梯度引导或搜索策略优化空间关系。

Result: PSE与人类判断更一致，PSG显著提升了空间关系的生成准确性。

Conclusion: PoS框架有效解决了文本到图像模型在空间关系生成中的问题，提供了更可靠的评估和生成方法。

Abstract: Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,
realistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional
generation, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the
input prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment
of spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images
that reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input
prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework
for modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging
the concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we
make two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,
PoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D
spatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human
judgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time
method that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I
models without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based
reward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a
gradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during
the denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of
initial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to
traditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure
of complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,
PSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate
images with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的目标检测方法，将重点从传统的基于类别的分类转向对象危害性判定，以提升自动驾驶车辆（AV）对未知物体的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法只能识别已知类别的物体，无法有效应对分布外（OOD）物体，可能导致安全隐患。

Method: 通过对象相对于AV的位置和轨迹，将其分类为‘有害’或‘无害’，而非基于具体类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效检测OOD物体并评估其危害性，从而提升AV的动态决策能力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著增强了AV在动态环境中的安全性和决策效果。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their
surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object
detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's
ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to
detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous
situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection
approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification
to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their
specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'
based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object
position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can
effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer
real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies
them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in
dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决现有LiDAR世界模型领域适应性差的问题，探索跨领域转移的可能性。

Method: 采用预训练模型进行多领域转移实验，并提出基于条件流匹配（CFM）的高效框架。

Result: 单预训练模型在多领域转移中表现优异，减少标注数据需求，CFM框架显著提升效率和压缩比。

Conclusion: LiDAR世界模型在多领域转移中具有潜力，CFM框架显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: LiDAR-based world models offer more structured and geometry-aware
representations than their image-based counterparts. However, existing LiDAR
world models are narrowly trained; each model excels only in the domain for
which it was built. Can we develop LiDAR world models that exhibit strong
transferability across multiple domains? We conduct the first systematic domain
transfer study across three demanding scenarios: (i) outdoor to indoor
generalization, (ii) sparse-beam \& dense-beam adaptation, and (iii)
non-semantic to semantic transfer. Given different amounts of fine-tuning data,
our experiments show that a single pre-trained model can achieve up to 11%
absolute improvement (83\% relative) over training from scratch and outperforms
training from scratch in 30/36 of our comparisons. This transferability of
dynamic learning significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated data
for semantic occupancy forecasting: our method exceed the previous semantic
occupancy forecasting models with only 5% of the labeled training data required
by prior models. We also observed inefficiencies of current LiDAR world models,
mainly through their under-compression of LiDAR data and inefficient training
objectives. To address this, we propose a latent conditional flow matching
(CFM)-based frameworks that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
using only half the training data and a compression ratio 6 times higher than
that of prior methods. Our model achieves SOTA performance on
future-trajectory-conditioned semantic occupancy forecasting while being 23x
more computationally efficient (a 28x FPS speedup); and achieves SOTA
performance on semantic occupancy forecasting while being 2x more
computationally efficient (a 1.1x FPS speedup).

Result: PathDiff在图像保真度、文本-图像对齐和真实性方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PathDiff有效解决了数据稀缺问题，为下游任务（如核分割和分类）提供了高质量的数据增强。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing
histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints.
Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks
offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct
morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data
for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image
generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits
of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial
details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that
effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities
into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over
structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically
accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment,
and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei
segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: CLDF通过对比学习有效减少了扩散模型的噪声，提升了弱监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels
often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However,
traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise
object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and
segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as
an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong
image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By
modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related
objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps
generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse
diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with
Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to
train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a
low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate
gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify
foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for
contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental
results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: 论文提出的InDiTE-Diff方法有效解决了时间变异图像修复问题，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on a novel and practical task, i.e., Time-vAriant
iMage inPainting (TAMP). The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image
by leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both
images captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,
i.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image
inpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content
distinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such
an application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image
by referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the
reference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to
achieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address
such an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution
Transition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the
time-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of
damaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP
solution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven
Diffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and
conducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack
of benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,
based on existing image and mask datasets. We conduct experiments on the
TAMP-Street datasets under two different time-variant image inpainting
settings, which show our method consistently outperform SOTA reference-guided
image inpainting methods for solving TAMP.

Motivation: 工业应用中机器学习模型的成功依赖于高质量的训练数据集，但大规模数据集（如众包或网络爬取的数据）常存在标签噪声和不一致问题，尤其是在制造领域，获取高质量标签成本高且耗时。

Method: VLSR框架利用CLIP模型将图像和文本标签嵌入共享语义空间，通过余弦相似度进行标签清洗（识别无关、拼写错误或语义弱的标签）和聚类（合并语义相似的标签）。

Result: 在Factorynet数据集上的实验表明，VLSR能有效识别问题标签并提升标签一致性，同时通过聚类减少标签词汇量，显著提高数据集质量。

Conclusion: VLSR框架能以最小人工干预提升工业应用数据集的标签质量，从而支持更鲁棒的机器学习模型训练。

Abstract: The success of machine learning models in industrial applications is heavily
dependent on the quality of the datasets used to train the models. However,
large-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and
web-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This
problem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining
high-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces
Vision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a
vision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in
multi-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and
their associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the
CLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by
computing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization
is performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,
and surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing
image-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.
Second, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,
followed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels
into unified label groups. The Factorynet dataset, which includes noisy labels
from both human annotations and web-scraped sources, is employed to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate
that the VLSR framework successfully identifies problematic labels and improves
label consistency. This method enables a significant reduction in label
vocabulary through clustering, which ultimately enhances the dataset's quality
for training robust machine learning models in industrial applications with
minimal human intervention.

Method: 提出AdFair-CLIP框架，利用对抗特征干预抑制敏感属性，减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上，AdFair-CLIP显著提高了公平性和诊断准确性，并在零样本和少样本场景中保持稳健性。

Conclusion: AdFair-CLIP为基于CLIP的医学诊断模型设定了公平性学习的新基准，尤其在胸部X光分析中。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have demonstrated
superior performance across various visual tasks including medical image
classification. However, fairness concerns, including demographic biases, have
received limited attention for CLIP models. This oversight leads to critical
issues, particularly those related to race and gender, resulting in disparities
in diagnostic outcomes and reduced reliability for underrepresented groups. To
address these challenges, we introduce AdFair-CLIP, a novel framework employing
adversarial feature intervention to suppress sensitive attributes, thereby
mitigating spurious correlations and improving prediction fairness. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on chest X-ray (CXR) datasets, and show that
AdFair-CLIP significantly enhances both fairness and diagnostic accuracy, while
maintaining robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. These
results establish new benchmarks for fairness-aware learning in CLIP-based
medical diagnostic models, particularly for CXR analysis.

TL;DR: GeoCD是一种基于拓扑感知和完全可微分的地测距近似方法，用于改进3D点云学习中的Chamfer Distance（CD）指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CD因其简单高效被广泛使用，但仅依赖欧氏距离，无法捕捉3D形状的内在几何特征。

Method: 提出GeoCD，一种拓扑感知的地测距近似方法，并通过微调模型验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，GeoCD在多种架构和数据集上显著提升了重建质量，仅需单次微调即可在多指标上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: GeoCD是一种有效的改进CD的指标，能够更好地捕捉3D形状的几何特征。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is a widely adopted metric in 3D point cloud learning
due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, it suffers from a fundamental
limitation: it relies solely on Euclidean distances, which often fail to
capture the intrinsic geometry of 3D shapes. To address this limitation, we
propose GeoCD, a topology-aware and fully differentiable approximation of
geodesic distance designed to serve as a metric for 3D point cloud learning.
Our experiments show that GeoCD consistently improves reconstruction quality
over standard CD across various architectures and datasets. We demonstrate this
by fine-tuning several models, initially trained with standard CD, using GeoCD.
Remarkably, fine-tuning for a single epoch with GeoCD yields significant gains
across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Implicit Neural Representation (INR)的高GPU资源需求和GaussianImage训练慢、适应性差的问题。

Method: 使用网络快速生成粗略高斯表示，并通过少量微调步骤优化，动态调整高斯点数量以适应图像复杂度。

Result: 在DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，渲染性能与GaussianImage相当或更优，训练时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了效率和适应性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has demonstrated remarkable advances in
the field of image representation but demands substantial GPU resources.
GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this
cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed
number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information
entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and
self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting.
Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian
representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable
rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time.
Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based
on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice.
Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds
GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter
training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one
order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same
number of Gaussians.

Abstract: Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range
of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical
concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the
geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or
captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing
serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other
security threats.
  Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation
techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and
evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on
geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view
imagery.
  Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large
models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to
$49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the
models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues
from visual data.
  Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual
elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text,
architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the
potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and
discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate
associated risks. Our code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: MTADiffusion通过改进语义对齐、结构稳定性和风格一致性，显著提升了对象修复的效果。

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled image inpainting models to
generate content within specific regions of an image based on provided prompts
and masks. However, existing inpainting methods often suffer from problems such
as semantic misalignment, structural distortion, and style inconsistency. In
this work, we present MTADiffusion, a Mask-Text Alignment diffusion model
designed for object inpainting. To enhance the semantic capabilities of the
inpainting model, we introduce MTAPipeline, an automatic solution for
annotating masks with detailed descriptions. Based on the MTAPipeline, we
construct a new MTADataset comprising 5 million images and 25 million mask-text
pairs. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task training strategy that integrates
both inpainting and edge prediction tasks to improve structural stability. To
promote style consistency, we present a novel inpainting style-consistency loss
using a pre-trained VGG network and the Gram matrix. Comprehensive evaluations
on BrushBench and EditBench demonstrate that MTADiffusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qwen-GUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM)
specifically designed for Graphical User Interface grounding tasks, achieving
performance competitive with significantly larger models. Unlike large-scale
VLMs (>7B parameters) that are computationally intensive and impractical for
consumer-grade hardware, Qwen-GUI-3B delivers strong grounding accuracy while
being fully trainable on a single GPU (RTX 4090). The model incorporates
several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset
of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI
screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop
environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial
cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by
specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model
adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies,
demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy
achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity
over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding
benchmarks-including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging
ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights Qwen-GUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9%
on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本匹配任务中表现优异，但在细粒度细节（如对象属性和空间关系）和动作感知方面存在不足。

Method: 设计了动作三元组提示和动作状态提示，利用LLM生成的动作相关知识，并提出自适应交互模块以聚合视觉特征。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入动作相关知识，显著提升了CLIP模型在细粒度动作理解上的性能。

Abstract: Driven by large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-trained models such as
CLIP, recent advancements in the image-text matching task have achieved
remarkable success in representation learning. Due to image-level
visual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained
details such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.
Recent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual
representations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level
alignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to
perceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships
between objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained
action-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware
multi-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external
knowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an
action triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional
semantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in
LLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate
attentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for
establishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which
further improves the performance. Comprehensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is crucial for autonomous navigation,
environmental monitoring, and marine exploration, but it is severely hampered
by light attenuation, turbidity, and occlusion. Current methods balance
accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in
real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of
physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this
study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve
structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large
receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity.
Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations
such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion
simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive
tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion
robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by
up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation
strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and
effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成动态且空间一致的全景视频，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了全景视频生成的挑战，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Panoramic video generation aims to synthesize 360-degree immersive videos,
holding significant importance in the fields of VR, world models, and spatial
intelligence. Existing works fail to synthesize high-quality panoramic videos
due to the inherent modality gap between panoramic data and perspective data,
which constitutes the majority of the training data for modern diffusion
models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework utilizing pretrained
perspective video models for generating panoramic videos. Specifically, we
design a novel panorama representation named ViewPoint map, which possesses
global spatial continuity and fine-grained visual details simultaneously. With
our proposed Pano-Perspective attention mechanism, the model benefits from
pretrained perspective priors and captures the panoramic spatial correlations
of the ViewPoint map effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can synthesize highly dynamic and spatially consistent panoramic videos,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing previous methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires
maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view
consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view
synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views.
Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but
such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This
paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes
diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance
diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention
manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to
ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable
for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency
across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Conclusion: 通过结合眼动追踪信息和弱监督学习，论文提出的方法显著提升了视频显著物体检测的性能。

Abstract: The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient
object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video
and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency
masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are
more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of
human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to
assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the
one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided
by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to
provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On
the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak
supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A
Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality
constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate
object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed
Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities
under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive
learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks
indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation

Conclusion: 该方法高效、实用，显著提升自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Traditional vision-based autonomous driving systems often face difficulties
in navigating complex environments when relying solely on single-image inputs.
To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image
frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and
adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods
exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them
impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address
these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a
method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by
breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces
model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and
real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance
autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin
while achieving real-time performance. Additionally, real robot experiments
further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Training on test-time data enables deep learning models to adapt to dynamic
environmental changes, enhancing their practical applicability. Online
adaptation from source to target domains is promising but it remains highly
reliant on the performance of source pretrained model. In this paper, we
investigate whether test-time adaptation (TTA) methods can continuously improve
models trained via self-supervised learning (SSL) without relying on source
pretraining. We introduce a self-supervised TTA protocol after observing that
existing TTA approaches struggle when directly applied to self-supervised
models with low accuracy on the source domain. Furthermore, we propose a
collaborative learning framework that integrates SSL and TTA models, leveraging
contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for stepwise representation
refinement. We validate our method on diverse self-supervised models, including
DINO, MoCo, and iBOT, across TTA benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in SSL, showing that it achieves competitive
performance even without source pretraining.

Abstract: We introduce GVIT, a classification framework that abandons conventional
pixel or patch grid input representations in favor of a compact set of
learnable 2D Gaussians. Each image is encoded as a few hundred Gaussians whose
positions, scales, orientations, colors, and opacities are optimized jointly
with a ViT classifier trained on top of these representations. We reuse the
classifier gradients as constructive guidance, steering the Gaussians toward
class-salient regions while a differentiable renderer optimizes an image
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that by 2D Gaussian input representations
coupled with our GVIT guidance, using a relatively standard ViT architecture,
closely matches the performance of a traditional patch-based ViT, reaching a
76.9% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet-1k using a ViT-B architecture.

Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage,
preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to
traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane,
providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs
accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous
automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we
develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text)
guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation
to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based
framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from
redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to
reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for
coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for
overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US
dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA
diagnosis. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhoo0302/CUA-US.

*Weida Wang,Changyong He,Jin Zeng,Di Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运动不变图融合的ToF深度去噪网络，通过跨帧几何注意力增强时间稳定性和空间清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ToF传感器捕获的深度图像易受噪声影响，现有方法未充分考虑跨帧深度变化，导致时间不一致和空间模糊。

Method: 利用图结构的时域自相似性进行图融合，结合图像平滑先验和ToF噪声分布，构建最大后验问题，并通过迭代滤波器实现。

Result: 在合成DVToF数据集上达到最先进性能，并在真实Kinectv2数据集上表现鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图融合和几何注意力实现了高性能且可解释的ToF深度去噪。

Abstract: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise,
requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either
focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without
considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph
fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness.
Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit
temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph
fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and
data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum
a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into
iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed
geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic
DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset.

*Hui Li,Baoyou Chen,Liwei Zhang,Jiaye Li,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPFlow通过动态调整patch大小和线性投影，优化了DiTs的计算成本，同时保持了生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的DiTs使用固定patch大小，无法根据噪声水平动态调整计算成本。PPFlow旨在通过动态patch化提高效率。

Method: PPFlow采用金字塔式patch化流程，根据噪声水平动态调整patch大小，并为每个尺寸学习线性投影。

Result: PPFlow在训练和推理速度上显著提升，同时保持图像生成性能。

Conclusion: PPFlow是一种高效的动态patch化方法，适用于DiTs，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations
to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of
tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single
patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow
(PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and
small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for
each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow,
our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid
representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the
renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two
training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$)
inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with
slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance.
Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with
small training time. The code and checkpoint are at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Oneta的多风格图像增强算法，通过两步操作（强度增强和色彩校正）实现高性能，支持多种风格任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多风格图像增强任务，通过简单但高效的两步模型实现广泛适用性。

Method: 使用Y-Net和C-Net预测参数，引入eigenTF紧凑表示，通过K个可学习token支持多风格。

Result: 在30个数据集上成功完成六种增强任务，表现优异。

Conclusion: Oneta是一种高效且通用的多风格图像增强方法。

Abstract: The first algorithm, called Oneta, for a novel task of multi-style image
enhancement is proposed in this work. Oneta uses two point operators
sequentially: intensity enhancement with a transformation function (TF) and
color correction with a color correction matrix (CCM). This two-step
enhancement model, though simple, achieves a high performance upper bound.
Also, we introduce eigentransformation function (eigenTF) to represent TF
compactly. The Oneta network comprises Y-Net and C-Net to predict eigenTF and
CCM parameters, respectively. To support $K$ styles, Oneta employs $K$
learnable tokens. During training, each style token is learned using image
pairs from the corresponding dataset. In testing, Oneta selects one of the $K$
style tokens to enhance an image accordingly. Extensive experiments show that
the single Oneta network can effectively undertake six enhancement tasks --
retouching, image signal processing, low-light image enhancement, dehazing,
underwater image enhancement, and white balancing -- across 30 datasets.

Motivation: 现有研究通常将面部运动合成和语音合成视为独立任务，忽略了二者的内在联系。

Method: 采用流匹配和MM-DiT架构，结合Motion-DiT和Audio-DiT模块，通过选择性联合注意力层实现跨模态交互。

Result: JAM-Flow支持多种输入条件（如文本、参考音频和运动），实现了同步的多模态合成。

Conclusion: JAM-Flow为音频-视觉合成提供了一个实用的整体解决方案。

Abstract: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in
generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are
typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a
unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial
motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal
Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT
and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers
and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned
positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable
effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths.
Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of
conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference
motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from
text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model.
JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a
practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LH2Face的新型损失函数，通过结合vMF分布和自适应边距策略，优化了高质量硬样本的人脸识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于余弦相似度和softmax分类的人脸识别方法在处理硬样本时表现不佳，且未考虑人脸质量或识别难度。

Method: 结合vMF分布的相似性度量，提出自适应边距的softmax分类方法，并利用代理损失函数优化表示空间分布。

Result: 在IJB-B数据集上达到49.39%的准确率，优于第二名2.37%。

Conclusion: LH2Face通过自适应边距和代理约束，显著提升了高质量硬样本的识别性能。

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR)
algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite
its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard
samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular
or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition
hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an
overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss
function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face).
Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density
Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability
distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification
method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is
implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to
apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their
representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that
optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is
superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving
49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method
by 2.37%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体中心辐射场（OcRF）的方法，通过增强3D体素特征和2D BEV特征，提升多视角3D目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过深度估计或3D位置编码隐式地将2D特征转换为3D空间，限制了检测性能。作者假设辐射场可以增强3D几何估计能力，但直接用于3D渲染会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出物体中心辐射场（OcRF），专注于建模前景物体并忽略背景噪声；使用高度感知不透明度注意力（HOA）增强2D BEV特征。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到57.2% mAP和64.8% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OcRFDet通过OcRF和HOA显著提升了3D目标检测性能，证明了物体中心辐射场的有效性。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D object detection methods typically transfer 2D features
into 3D space using depth estimation or 3D position encoder, but in a fully
data-driven and implicit manner, which limits the detection performance.
Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they
can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation.
However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use
them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the
performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when
rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric
radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding
background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields
(OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering
foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to
enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention
(HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately
via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP
and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率卫星图像获取受限于传感器的时空限制和高成本，影响环境监测等应用。

Method: 提出MWT-Diff框架，结合潜在扩散模型和小波变换，利用MWT-Encoder生成嵌入特征，指导分层扩散动态重建高分辨率图像。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，通过FID和LPIPS等感知质量指标验证。

Conclusion: MWT-Diff能有效解决卫星图像超分辨率问题，保留关键空间特征，适用于遥感分析。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-resolution satellite imagery is often constrained by
the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite sensors, as well as the high
costs associated with frequent observations. These challenges hinder
applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and
agricultural management, which require fine-grained and high-resolution data.
In this paper, we propose MWT-Diff, an innovative framework for satellite image
super-resolution (SR) that combines latent diffusion models with wavelet
transforms to address these challenges. At the core of the framework is a novel
metadata-, wavelet-, and time-aware encoder (MWT-Encoder), which generates
embeddings that capture metadata attributes, multi-scale frequency information,
and temporal relationships. The embedded feature representations steer the
hierarchical diffusion dynamics, through which the model progressively
reconstructs high-resolution satellite imagery from low-resolution inputs. This
process preserves critical spatial characteristics including textural patterns,
boundary discontinuities, and high-frequency spectral components essential for
detailed remote sensing analysis. The comparative analysis of MWT-Diff across
multiple datasets demonstrated favorable performance compared to recent
approaches, as measured by standard perceptual quality metrics including FID
and LPIPS.

Motivation: 传统帧式相机在复杂背景下检测小目标（如无人机）时存在低帧率、动态范围有限和数据冗余等问题，而事件相机的高时间分辨率和动态范围更适合此类任务。然而，现有事件数据集规模小且目标大，缺乏多样性，无法作为小目标检测的基准。

Method: 提出了EV-UAV数据集，包含147个序列和230万事件级标注，目标平均尺寸极小（6.8×5.4像素）。同时提出EV-SpSegNet方法，利用时空事件点云中目标运动的连续性，结合STC损失函数优化网络。

Conclusion: EV-UAV数据集和EV-SpSegNet方法为基于事件的小目标检测提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Small object detection (SOD) in anti-UAV task is a challenging problem due to
the small size of UAVs and complex backgrounds. Traditional frame-based cameras
struggle to detect small objects in complex environments due to their low frame
rates, limited dynamic range, and data redundancy. Event cameras, with
microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range, provide a more
effective solution for SOD. However, existing event-based object detection
datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse
backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we
introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV),
the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes
147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring
extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse
scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore,
based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in
spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation
Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud
space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion
continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive
experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and
provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD. The dataset and code are at

Motivation: 现有方法在预训练中使用特定类别提示，容易导致过拟合和泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出了Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP)模块和Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA)模块，结合堆叠提示和多类别特征融合。

Result: 在七个工业异常检测数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: StackCLIP方法显著提升了训练速度、稳定性和收敛性，同时具备强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the alignment between text and image features in the CLIP model is
a critical challenge in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks. Recent
studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining,
which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model
generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category
names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming
the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components.
The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts
by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object
textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar
objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific
linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them
based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to
deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly
boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt
framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further
improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module,
which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt
learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks.
Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly
detection and segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet
informative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original
dataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational
consumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling
information from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in
the data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,
particularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical
outputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate
vision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill
language information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,
thereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text
prototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information
generated by an open-source large language model. This framework demonstrates
broad applicability across datasets without pre-existing text descriptions,
expanding the potential of dataset distillation beyond traditional image-based
approaches. Compared to other methods, the proposed approach generates
logically coherent images containing target objects, achieving state-of-the-art
validation performance and demonstrating robust generalization. Source code and
generated data are available in

Conclusion: PBCAT为防御物理可实现攻击提供了一种有效且统一的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Object detection plays a crucial role in many security-sensitive
applications. However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors
can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches
and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats.
Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense
against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the
$l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically
realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early
attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT
against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this
work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with
a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite
Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the
combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible
global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs,
PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also
unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive
experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved
robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art
defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over
previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.

Motivation: LVLMs在解释视觉信息时经常产生与视觉内容不符的输出（对象幻觉），现有方法依赖昂贵的手动标注或增加推理时间。

Method: 提出Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention（CAI），利用标题查询时的注意力激活模式增强视觉感知能力。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CAI以最小的额外推理成本实现了最先进的幻觉缓解性能。

Conclusion: CAI是一种高效且无需额外训练的幻觉缓解方法。

Abstract: Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce
content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination.
To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and
training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we
observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger
when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by
this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a
training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the
attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs'
visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four
benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that
CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only
with minimal additional inference cost.

Abstract: Lecture slide element detection and retrieval are key problems in slide
understanding. Training effective models for these tasks often depends on
extensive manual annotation. However, annotating large volumes of lecture
slides for supervised training is labor intensive and requires domain
expertise. To address this, we propose a large language model (LLM)-guided
synthetic lecture slide generation pipeline, SynLecSlideGen, which produces
high-quality, coherent and realistic slides. We also create an evaluation
benchmark, namely RealSlide by manually annotating 1,050 real lecture slides.
To assess the utility of our synthetic slides, we perform few-shot transfer
learning on real data using models pre-trained on them. Experimental results
show that few-shot transfer learning with pretraining on synthetic slides
significantly improves performance compared to training only on real data. This
demonstrates that synthetic data can effectively compensate for limited labeled
lecture slides. The code and resources of our work are publicly available on

Abstract: Lidar point cloud synthesis based on generative models offers a promising
solution to augment deep learning pipelines, particularly when real-world data
is scarce or lacks diversity. By enabling flexible object manipulation, this
synthesis approach can significantly enrich training datasets and enhance
discriminative models. However, existing methods focus on unconditional lidar
point cloud generation, overlooking their potential for real-world
applications. In this paper, we propose SG-LDM, a Semantic-Guided Lidar
Diffusion Model that employs latent alignment to enable robust
semantic-to-lidar synthesis. By directly operating in the native lidar space
and leveraging explicit semantic conditioning, SG-LDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generating high-fidelity lidar point clouds guided by semantic
labels. Moreover, we propose the first diffusion-based lidar translation
framework based on SG-LDM, which enables cross-domain translation as a domain
adaptation strategy to enhance downstream perception performance. Systematic

*Shiqi Zhang,Sha Zhang,Jiajun Deng,Yedong Shen,Mingxiao MA,Yanyong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGOV3D提出了一种基于Partial-to-Global课程学习的两阶段框架，用于改进开放词汇的3D语义分割，通过利用多视角图像的语义信息和跨视图一致性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多视角图像仅视为传递开放词汇信息的中介，忽略了其丰富的语义内容和跨视图对应关系，限制了模型效果。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）在部分场景上预训练，利用多模态大语言模型和2D分割基础模型生成开放词汇标签；2）在完整场景上微调，通过伪标签桥接部分观察与大规模3D环境的语义差距。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和S3DIS基准测试中，PGOV3D表现出色。

Conclusion: PGOV3D通过Partial-to-Global课程学习和跨视图一致性模块，显著提升了开放词汇3D语义分割的效果。

Abstract: Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise
3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted
from multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat
multi-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary
information, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view
correspondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose
PGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for
improving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in
a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on
partial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple
geometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs
via pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we
leverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation
foundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,
offering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency
module is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints
and enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model
on complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more
complex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and
generate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the
semantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D
environments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS
benchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in
open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.

*Ziao Liu,Zhenjia Li,Yifeng Shi,Xiangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttentionGS提出了一种新框架，通过结构注意力直接从随机初始化进行3D重建，解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）对高质量点云的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS依赖于结构从运动（SfM）的高质量点云，在纹理不足或视角受限的场景中表现不佳。

Method: AttentionGS结合几何注意力和纹理注意力，早期恢复全局结构，后期优化细节，并使用不透明度加权梯度指导高斯密集化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，AttentionGS显著优于现有方法，尤其在点云初始化不可靠的场景中。

Conclusion: AttentionGS为3DGS在现实应用中的鲁棒性和灵活性提供了新途径。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in
texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in
3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a
novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point
clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from
randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric
attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training
progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and
enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to
guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in
scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves
the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboVSR是一种基于扩散模型的超高效视频超分辨率方法，通过高压缩比自动编码器、分解条件化和预训练扩散模型的捷径转换，显著提升了计算效率，速度提升100倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法在细节生成上表现优异，但计算效率低下，处理短视频耗时过长。

Method: 1. 使用高压缩比自动编码器减少token数量；2. 引入分解条件化降低训练复杂度；3. 将预训练扩散模型转换为捷径模型以减少采样步骤。

Result: TurboVSR性能与现有最佳方法相当，但速度快100倍以上，处理2秒1080p视频仅需7秒，并支持4K图像超分辨率。

Conclusion: TurboVSR在保持高性能的同时大幅提升效率，为更高分辨率的超分辨率任务提供了可能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in
the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in
detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face
significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current
techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p
video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based
video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1)
We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8
to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial
challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the
learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame;
subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the
high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We
convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer
sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs
on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking
only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports
image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient
design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image
SR show surprising fine details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频中心Transformer方法存在音频混合导致的感知模糊性和视觉细节丢失问题，影响了分割准确性。

Method: 提出VCT框架，利用视觉驱动的查询迭代获取音频和视觉信息，并引入PPQG模块生成语义和视觉丰富的查询。

Result: 在AVSBench数据集的三个子集上实现了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: VCT框架有效解决了音频中心方法的局限性，提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to segment sound-producing objects in
video frames based on the associated audio signal. Prevailing AVS methods
typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries
are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer
from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio,
and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address
these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework
that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio
and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between
different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their
contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation
(PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that
are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting
and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new
state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset. The
code is available at https://github.com/spyflying/VCT_AVS.

Abstract: Brain plays a crucial role in regulating body functions and cognitive
processes, with brain tumors posing significant risks to human health. Precise
and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient
outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include
biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and
the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in
automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical
images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have
limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets,
and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our
research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The
novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model
which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient
decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate
results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够在不额外训练的情况下，将多个概念的属性融合为单一新颖的图像。

Method: 研究了四种融合方法，利用扩散管道的不同方面（如提示调度、嵌入插值或分层条件）。

Result: 实验表明扩散模型具备创造性融合能力，但不同方法在不同场景下表现各异，受提示顺序、概念距离和随机种子等因素影响。

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有显著的组合潜力，但对输入变化敏感，需根据场景选择合适方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have dramatically advanced text-to-image generation in
recent years, translating abstract concepts into high-fidelity images with
remarkable ease. In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct
concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new
visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending
merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts)
into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We
investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the
diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or
layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse
concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound
words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we
show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities
without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving
100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios:
each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like
prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome.
These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion
models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.

Method: 应用字节对编码到视觉标记，引入优先级引导的编码方案和多阶段训练流程。

Result: 实验表明在多种视觉-语言任务中性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过统一视觉与文本表示，推动了更高效的多模态基础模型发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities
remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal
understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method
directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring
successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a
priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial
consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on
curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer
model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual
information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across
diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual
representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable
and efficient multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: VAP-Diffusion框架利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的外部知识，通过视觉属性提示生成更真实多样的医学图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的生成需要丰富的属性信息，但详细描述不易获取，因此探索利用MLLMs提升生成质量与多样性。

Method: 设计基于Chain-of-Thoughts的提示从MLLMs获取描述，训练时存储描述，测试时随机检索；提出原型条件机制增强对未见描述组合的鲁棒性。

Result: 在四种数据集的三种常见医学图像类型上验证了VAP-Diffusion的有效性。

Conclusion: VAP-Diffusion通过结合MLLMs的外部知识，显著提升了医学图像生成的多样性和质量。

Abstract: As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying
factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to
produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin
lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis,
such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions
are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed
Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from
pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality
and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from
MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following
Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic,
colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during
training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions
are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover,
to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test
time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings
to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of
medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.

Conclusion: MReg在二尖瓣反流诊断中具有高准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Color Doppler echocardiography is a crucial tool for diagnosing mitral
regurgitation (MR). Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR
diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these
approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to
suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an
automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color
Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature
mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical
realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis
as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships
between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification
mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR
grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a
feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the
representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated
our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases
with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised
video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg
demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis. Our code is available at:

Abstract: In real-world vision-language applications, practitioners increasingly rely
on large, pretrained foundation models rather than custom-built solutions,
despite limited transparency regarding their training data and processes. While
these models achieve impressive performance on general benchmarks, their
effectiveness can decline notably under specialized domain shifts, such as
unique imaging conditions or environmental variations. In this work, we
introduce Deepbench, a framework designed to assess domain-specific robustness
of vision-language models (VLMs). Deepbench leverages a large language model
(LLM) to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to
specific deployment domains without requiring labeled data. We evaluate a range
of contrastive vision-language architectures and architectural variants across
six real-world domains and observe substantial variability in robustness,
highlighting the need for targeted, domain-aware evaluation. Deepbench is
released as open-source software to support further research into domain-aware
robustness assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Partial Forward Blocking（PFB）的新框架，通过自适应剪枝管道减少计算成本，同时保持训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据剪枝方法因依赖梯度或代理模型而产生的高计算成本问题。

Method: 基于目标模型浅层特征评估样本重要性，剪枝不重要样本，仅保留样本进行后续前向传播和损失反向传播。

Result: 在ImageNet上，PFB在剪除40%数据的情况下，实现了0.5%的准确率提升和33%的训练时间减少。

Conclusion: PFB在性能和速度上显著优于现有方法，是一种高效且无损的训练加速框架。

Abstract: The ever-growing size of training datasets enhances the generalization
capability of modern machine learning models but also incurs exorbitant
computational costs. Existing data pruning approaches aim to accelerate
training by removing those less important samples. However, they often rely on
gradients or proxy models, leading to prohibitive additional costs of gradient
back-propagation and proxy model training. In this paper, we propose Partial
Forward Blocking (PFB), a novel framework for lossless training acceleration.
The efficiency of PFB stems from its unique adaptive pruning pipeline: sample
importance is assessed based on features extracted from the shallow layers of
the target model. Less important samples are then pruned, allowing only the
retained ones to proceed with the subsequent forward pass and loss
back-propagation. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational
overhead of deep-layer forward passes and back-propagation for pruned samples,
while also eliminating the need for auxiliary backward computations and proxy
model training. Moreover, PFB introduces probability density as an indicator of
sample importance. Combined with an adaptive distribution estimation module,
our method dynamically prioritizes relatively rare samples, aligning with the
constantly evolving training state. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant superiority of PFB in performance and speed. On ImageNet, PFB
achieves a 0.5% accuracy improvement and 33% training time reduction with 40%
data pruned.

Motivation: Vision Transformer计算成本高，传统剪枝方法在未见数据域中表现不佳，导致资源分配不理想。

Method: 提出P3B方法，利用块级相对贡献全局分配参数，识别低影响组件并保留关键部分。

Result: P3B在高稀疏性（70%参数减少）下仅损失0.64%准确率，在迁移学习中表现突出。

Conclusion: P3B是一种先进的剪枝方法，尤其适用于资源受限的硬件和迁移学习任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformer have set new benchmarks in several tasks, but these models
come with the lack of high computational costs which makes them impractical for
resource limited hardware. Network pruning reduces the computational complexity
by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However,
pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight
significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we
find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature
representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early
pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block
Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on
block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact
components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones.
Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements.
In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance
metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in
extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most
noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve
high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction
while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.

Abstract: Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based
adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly
gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability
of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to
generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake
detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example
transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates
traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based
adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application
across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the
"1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of
AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness
of our approach.

Conclusion: SynMotion通过联合优化语义和视觉表示，实现了高质量的视频运动定制生成。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video motion customization facilitates the acquisition of
human motion representations from a few video samples, while achieving
arbitrary subjects transfer through precise textual conditioning. Existing
approaches often rely on semantic-level alignment, expecting the model to learn
new motion concepts and combine them with other entities (e.g., ''cats'' or
''dogs'') to produce visually appealing results. However, video data involve
complex spatio-temporal patterns, and focusing solely on semantics cause the
model to overlook the visual complexity of motion. Conversely, tuning only the
visual representation leads to semantic confusion in representing the intended
action. To address these limitations, we propose SynMotion, a new
motion-customized video generation model that jointly leverages semantic
guidance and visual adaptation. At the semantic level, we introduce the
dual-embedding semantic comprehension mechanism which disentangles subject and
motion representations, allowing the model to learn customized motion features
while preserving its generative capabilities for diverse subjects. At the
visual level, we integrate parameter-efficient motion adapters into a
pre-trained video generation model to enhance motion fidelity and temporal
coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a new embedding-specific training strategy
which \textbf{alternately optimizes} subject and motion embeddings, supported
by the manually constructed Subject Prior Video (SPV) training dataset. This
strategy promotes motion specificity while preserving generalization across
diverse subjects. Lastly, we introduce MotionBench, a newly curated benchmark

*Smriti Joshi,Richard Osuala,Lidia Garrucho,Kaisar Kushibar,Dimitri Kessler,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于补丁的多视图协同训练方法，用于单图像测试时适应，解决了医学影像中实时适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法依赖大数据集，不适用于医学场景中单患者实时推理的需求，且未能充分利用三维医学影像数据。

Method: 采用不确定性引导的自训练，通过特征和预测一致性实现单测试图像的有效体积分割。

Result: 在三个公开的乳腺MRI数据集上验证，性能接近监督基准，平均Dice系数提升3.75%。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学影像分割中表现出色，代码开源且易于集成。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during
inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such
on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large
target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical
scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current
methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the
volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a
Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time
adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through
uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in
the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three
publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor
segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound
supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art
methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly
share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet
framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.

TL;DR: Subjective Camera 是一种通过结合语言描述和渐进草图重建真实场景的方法，解决了语言模糊性和草图抽象性的双重限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在用户主观输入偏差、平面草图与3D先验之间的模态差距以及草图质量敏感性问题，需要资源密集型模型适应或不切实际的草图精度要求。

Method: 通过概念顺序生成，建立外观先验并实现顺序感知解耦生成，利用潜在优化桥接模态差距，采用分层奖励引导框架处理粗糙草图。

Result: 在多样数据集上评估表明，该方法在语义和空间一致性上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Subjective Camera 提供了一种无需训练即可适应用户主观期望的高效方法，显著提升了草图到图像的生成质量。

Abstract: We propose Subjective Camera, a human-as-imaging-device paradigm that
reconstructs real-world scenes from mental impressions through synergistic use
of verbal descriptions and progressive rough sketches. This approach overcomes
dual limitations of language ambiguity and sketch abstraction by treating the
user's drawing sequence as priors, effectively translating subjective
perceptual expectations into photorealistic images.
  Existing approaches face three fundamental barriers: (1) user-specific
subjective input biases, (2) huge modality gap between planar sketch and 3D
priors in diffusion, and (3) sketch quality-sensitive performance degradation.
Current solutions either demand resource-intensive model adaptation or impose
impractical requirements on sketch precision.
  Our framework addresses these challenges through concept-sequential
generation. (1) We establish robust appearance priors through text-reward
optimization, and then implement sequence-aware disentangled generation that
processes concepts in sketching order; these steps accommodate user-specific
subjective expectation in a train-free way. (2) We employ latent optimization
that effectively bridges the modality gap between planar sketches and 3D priors
in diffusion. (3) Our hierarchical reward-guided framework enables the use of
rough sketches without demanding artistic expertise. Comprehensive evaluation
across diverse datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in maintaining both semantic and spatial
coherence.

Motivation: 研究跨模型知识如何影响测试时适应（TTA）过程，发现模型间可以互补指导。

Method: 提出COCA框架，包含协同适应和自我适应策略，整合互补知识并增强模型独特性。

Result: COCA显著提升现有方法性能，例如将ViT-Base在ImageNet-C上的准确率从51.7%提高到64.5%。

Conclusion: 跨模型协同学习在TTA中有效，COCA可作为即插即用模块提升多样化模型性能。

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) adapts a given model to testing domain data with
potential domain shifts through online unsupervised learning, yielding
impressive performance. However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus
on single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing
question: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our
findings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can
provide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are
substantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like
MobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base
(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model
Co-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)
Co-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models
throughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)
Self-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised
learning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain. Extensive
experiments show that COCA, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module,
significantly boosts existing SOTAs, on models with various sizes--including
ResNets, ViTs, and Mobile-ViTs--via cross-model co-learned TTA. For example,
with Mobile-ViT's guidance, COCA raises ViT-Base's average adaptation accuracy
on ImageNet-C from 51.7% to 64.5%. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 视频身份定制任务面临身份一致性和运动自然性的挑战，需要一种新方法来统一视觉和文本线索，并动态调节身份条件。

Method: 提出多模态身份融合模块（MIF）、时间感知身份注入机制（TAII）和自适应运动学习策略（AML），构建高质量数据集Proteus-Bench。

Result: Proteus-ID在身份保持、文本对齐和运动质量上优于现有方法，成为视频身份定制的新基准。

Conclusion: Proteus-ID通过创新模块和策略，显著提升了视频身份定制的效果，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video identity customization seeks to synthesize realistic, temporally
coherent videos of a specific subject, given a single reference image and a
text prompt. This task presents two core challenges: (1) maintaining identity
consistency while aligning with the described appearance and actions, and (2)
generating natural, fluid motion without unrealistic stiffness. To address
these challenges, we introduce Proteus-ID, a novel diffusion-based framework
for identity-consistent and motion-coherent video customization. First, we
propose a Multimodal Identity Fusion (MIF) module that unifies visual and
textual cues into a joint identity representation using a Q-Former, providing
coherent guidance to the diffusion model and eliminating modality imbalance.
Second, we present a Time-Aware Identity Injection (TAII) mechanism that
dynamically modulates identity conditioning across denoising steps, improving
fine-detail reconstruction. Third, we propose Adaptive Motion Learning (AML), a
self-supervised strategy that reweights the training loss based on
optical-flow-derived motion heatmaps, enhancing motion realism without
requiring additional inputs. To support this task, we construct Proteus-Bench,
a high-quality dataset comprising 200K curated clips for training and 150
individuals from diverse professions and ethnicities for evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Proteus-ID outperforms prior methods in identity
preservation, text alignment, and motion quality, establishing a new benchmark
for video identity customization. Codes and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇目标检测器在安全关键应用中存在局限性，但真实数据难以提供系统性评估。合成数据可以更系统地探索模型能力边界。

Method: 设计两个自动化流程，使用稳定扩散技术生成高多样性语义的合成数据，并评估多种开放词汇目标检测器。

Result: 合成数据能有效挑战检测器，发现其依赖对象位置而非语义，且容易忽略对象。

Conclusion: 合成数据为挑战和改进开放词汇目标检测器提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors such as Grounding DINO are trained on vast
and diverse data, achieving remarkable performance on challenging datasets. Due
to that, it is unclear where to find their limitations, which is of major
concern when using in safety-critical applications. Real-world data does not
provide sufficient control, required for a rigorous evaluation of model
generalization. In contrast, synthetically generated data allows to
systematically explore the boundaries of model competence/generalization. In
this work, we address two research questions: 1) Can we challenge
open-vocabulary object detectors with generated image content? 2) Can we find
systematic failure modes of those models? To address these questions, we design
two automated pipelines using stable diffusion to inpaint unusual objects with
high diversity in semantics, by sampling multiple substantives from WordNet and
ChatGPT. On the synthetically generated data, we evaluate and compare multiple
open-vocabulary object detectors as well as a classical object detector. The
synthetic data is derived from two real-world datasets, namely LostAndFound, a
challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmark, and the NuImages
dataset. Our results indicate that inpainting can challenge open-vocabulary
object detectors in terms of overlooking objects. Additionally, we find a
strong dependence of open-vocabulary models on object location, rather than on
object semantics. This provides a systematic approach to challenge
open-vocabulary models and gives valuable insights on how data could be
acquired to effectively improve these models.

Motivation: 现有多模态跟踪算法依赖高复杂度Vision Transformer架构，导致计算开销大且跨模态交互效果受限。

Method: 设计轻量级Prompt Generator生成模态特定提示向量，结合Vision Mamba骨干网络实现特征提取与融合。

Result: 在多个RGB-Event跟踪基准测试中表现优异，包括短期的COESOT和长期的FE108、FELT V2数据集。

Conclusion: Mamba-FETrack V2在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，代码和预训练模型将开源。

Abstract: Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust
object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However,
most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity
Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across
modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also
limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose
an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity
Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a
lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each
modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate
modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the
modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based
FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction,
cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused
representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target
localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,
FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the
proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack

Motivation: 解决OVLM在罕见类别检测上的不足，尤其是那些难以用文本描述且预训练数据中几乎不存在的类别。

Method: 利用多尺度文本化块和多阶段融合策略，将视觉示例信息转化为文本化视觉标记，与文本提示共同指导OVLM。

Result: 在开放集数据集和少样本基准（如PASCAL VOC和MSCOCO）上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: VisTex-OVLM在保持OVLM原有架构和泛化能力的同时，显著提升了少样本场景下的检测性能。

Abstract: We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that
introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual
exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language
Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to
describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while
preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM
leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to
integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized
visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike
previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM,
maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in
few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across
open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and
achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.
The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在真实世界复杂场景中表现不佳，如跨传感器分辨率差异和显著的土地覆盖变化，导致生成不足或过度依赖参考图像。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，引入双分支融合机制自适应整合参考图像的局部和全局信息，并提出Better Start策略减少去噪步骤。

Result: 在Real-RefRSSRD数据集上，CRefDiff在多项指标上达到最优，并提升了场景分类和语义分割等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CRefDiff通过可控的参考融合和高效推理，显著提升了遥感图像超分辨率的性能和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques can enhance the spatial resolution of remote
sensing images by utilizing low-resolution (LR) images to reconstruct
high-resolution (HR) images, enabling more efficient large-scale earth
observation applications. While single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods
have shown progress, reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) offers superior
performance by incorporating historical HR images alongside current LR
observations. However, existing RefSR methods struggle with real-world
complexities, such as cross-sensor resolution gap and significant land cover
changes, often leading to under-generation or over-reliance on reference image.
To address these challenges, we propose CRefDiff, a novel controllable
reference-based diffusion model for real-world remote sensing image SR. To
address the under-generation problem, CRefDiff is built upon the pretrained
Stable Diffusion model, leveraging its powerful generative prior to produce
accurate structures and textures. To mitigate over-reliance on the reference,
we introduce a dual-branch fusion mechanism that adaptively integrates both
local and global information from the reference image. Moreover, this novel
dual-branch design enables reference strength control during inference,
enhancing interactivity and flexibility of the model. Finally, a strategy named
Better Start is proposed to significantly reduce the number of denoising steps,
thereby accelerating the inference process. To support further research, we
introduce Real-RefRSSRD, a new real-world RefSR dataset for remote sensing
images, consisting of HR NAIP and LR Sentinel-2 image pairs with diverse land
cover changes and significant temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on
Real-RefRSSRD show that CRefDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various metrics and improves downstream tasks such as scene classification and
semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用已知相机标定的方法，通过引入成对相对旋转估计，实现无需初始化的校准SfM，生成接近度量的重建结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于pOSE的无初始化BA方法无法利用相机标定信息，导致重建结果仅能确定到投影变换，且需要更多数据。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入成对相对旋转估计，这些估计仅对相似变换不变，从而鼓励保留真实场景的度量特征。将旋转平均集成到pOSE框架中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能可靠优化目标，从随机初始解高概率收敛到全局最小值，生成准确的接近度量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需初始化的校准SfM，生成接近度量的重建结果，优于传统方法。

Abstract: A recent series of works has shown that initialization-free BA can be
achieved using pseudo Object Space Error (pOSE) as a surrogate objective. The
initial reconstruction-step optimizes an objective where all terms are
projectively invariant and it cannot incorporate knowledge of the camera
calibration. As a result, the solution is only determined up to a projective
transformation of the scene and the process requires more data for successful
reconstruction.
  In contrast, we present a method that is able to use the known camera
calibration thereby producing near metric solutions, that is, reconstructions
that are accurate up to a similarity transformation. To achieve this we
introduce pairwise relative rotation estimates that carry information about
camera calibration. These are only invariant to similarity transformations,
thus encouraging solutions that preserve metric features of the real scene. Our
method can be seen as integrating rotation averaging into the pOSE framework
striving towards initialization-free calibrated SfM.
  Our experimental evaluation shows that we are able to reliably optimize our
objective, achieving convergence to the global minimum with high probability
from random starting solutions, resulting in accurate near metric
reconstructions.

Abstract: An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging
the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both
image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation
(AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and
abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To
improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual
features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the
many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing
its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is
validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over
existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset
evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory
banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The

Result: 实验表明，LaZSL在解释性、准确性和领域泛化能力方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LaZSL为可解释零样本学习提供了一种有效方法，兼具性能与解释性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved
remarkable success in zero-shot learning (ZSL) by leveraging large-scale
visual-text pair datasets. However, these methods often lack interpretability,
as they compute the similarity between an entire query image and the embedded
category words, making it difficult to explain their predictions. One approach
to address this issue is to develop interpretable models by integrating
language, where classifiers are built using discrete attributes, similar to
human perception. This introduces a new challenge: how to effectively align
local visual features with corresponding attributes based on pre-trained VLMs.
To tackle this, we propose LaZSL, a locally-aligned vision-language model for
interpretable ZSL. LaZSL employs local visual-semantic alignment via optimal
transport to perform interaction between visual regions and their associated
attributes, facilitating effective alignment and providing interpretable
similarity without the need for additional training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method offers several advantages, including enhanced
interpretability, improved accuracy, and strong domain generalization. Codes

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异，显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: Flash-VStream在长视频理解中实现了高效和卓越性能。

Abstract: Benefiting from the advances in large language models and cross-modal
alignment, existing multimodal large language models have achieved prominent
performance in image and short video understanding. However, the understanding
of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in
significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long
videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world
applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these
issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of
processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.
Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity
context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the
distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to
retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to
existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference
latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video
benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method. Code

Method: 采用查询分支和邻居分支处理目标区域及其邻近区域，结合交叉注意力和对比学习。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，PCC指标提升超过20%。

Conclusion: NH2ST为基因表达预测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides crucial insights into tissue
micro-environments, but is limited to its high cost and complexity. As an
alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI)
is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on
single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial
and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g.,
gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among
adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address
these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and
both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model
comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch
and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and
contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure
alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods,
achieving over 20% in PCC metrics. Codes are available at

Motivation: 探索多头注意力机制在分类任务中的学习机制，并推广到大规模MHA（LS-MHA），以提高分类精度和效率。

Method: 使用单头性能（SHP）矩阵量化多头注意力的表现，分析其聚类特性，并设计新的视觉Transformer（ViT）架构。

Result: 发现SHP矩阵包含多个单元簇，每个标签由少数头明确识别，信噪比提高，分类精度提升，且通过卷积层替换减少延迟。

Conclusion: 该机制可推广至自然语言处理任务，为深度学习提供新见解，实验基于CIFAR-100数据集验证。

Abstract: The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of
multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks
was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal
performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention
on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying
learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single
matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to
single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results
indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each
label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This
leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,
thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several
distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy
but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields
superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on
hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is
achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer
blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage
learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The
extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks,
based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the
potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated
using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100
dataset.

Motivation: 传统图像比较方法在处理不同分辨率的二值图像时效果不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的比较方法。

Method: 通过将二值图像转换为标记点模式表示，提取关键特征（锚点），并使用总结向量进行图像比较。

Result: PointSSIM在结构分析中表现出高效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: PointSSIM为跨分辨率的结构分析提供了一种有效的图像比较方法。

Abstract: This paper presents PointSSIM, a novel low-dimensional image-to-image
comparison metric that is resolution invariant. Drawing inspiration from the
structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM
enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by
transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features
of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by
identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image
comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity,
connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this
approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison,
particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across
different resolutions.

*Ziwei Chen,Ziling Liu,Zitong Huang,Mingqi Gao,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAISE是一个3D增强框架，利用生成先验恢复缺失视角下的对象几何和外观，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景重建中因视角缺失导致的对象级建模挑战，提升下游任务的详细对象理解。

Method: 通过两阶段细化（代理替换和注册约束增强）恢复对象的几何和纹理。

Result: 在视角合成和几何补全任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RAISE能有效提升对象级建模的保真度，同时保持场景级一致性。

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera
paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than
individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity
object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation.
Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring
detailed object understanding and appearance modeling. In this paper, we
introduce Refine Any object In any ScenE (RAISE), a novel 3D enhancement
framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object
geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting from substituting
degraded objects with proxies, via a 3D generative model with strong 3D
understanding, RAISE progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning
each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DOF pose, followed by correcting
spatial and appearance inconsistencies via registration-constrained
enhancement. This two-stage refinement ensures the high-fidelity geometry and
appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency
in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that RAISE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and geometry completion
tasks. RAISE is made publicly available at https://github.com/PolySummit/RAISE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了机器人生成内容（RGC）的概念，并建立了首个RGC视频数据库（RGCD），用于评估现有视频质量评估（VQA）模型在RGC视频上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人视频在流媒体平台上的普及，RGC视频的感知质量对人与机器人交互至关重要，但目前缺乏针对RGC视频的质量评估研究。

Method: 建立了包含2,100个视频的RGCD数据库，并进行了主观VQA实验和11种先进VQA模型的基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有VQA模型在复杂的RGC视频上表现不佳，亟需开发针对RGC的专用VQA模型。

Conclusion: RGCD的建立为未来RGC视频质量评估研究提供了基础，并揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: As camera-equipped robotic platforms become increasingly integrated into
daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiNeuS是一个统一的神经表面重建框架，通过解决多视角辐射不一致、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强等问题，实现了几何保真度和光度一致性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多视角辐射一致性、无纹理区域关键点缺失和Eikonal约束过强等方面存在局限性，HiNeuS旨在通过统一框架解决这些问题。

Method: HiNeuS引入了三种技术：1) 基于SDF的差分可见性验证；2) 平面共形正则化；3) 物理基础的Eikonal松弛。这些技术协同优化几何和外观约束。

Result: 实验表明，HiNeuS在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离减少21.4%，PSNR提高2.32 dB，并能恢复镜面反射、城市布局和低纹理表面。

Conclusion: HiNeuS通过统一框架实现了几何和外观约束的协同优化，在表面重建和逆渲染任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction faces persistent challenges in reconciling
geometric fidelity with photometric consistency under complex scene conditions.
We present HiNeuS, a unified framework that holistically addresses three core
limitations in existing approaches: multi-view radiance inconsistency, missing
keypoints in textureless regions, and structural degradation from over-enforced
Eikonal constraints during joint optimization. To resolve these issues through
a unified pipeline, we introduce: 1) Differential visibility verification
through SDF-guided ray tracing, resolving reflection ambiguities via continuous
occlusion modeling; 2) Planar-conformal regularization via ray-aligned geometry
patches that enforce local surface coherence while preserving sharp edges
through adaptive appearance weighting; and 3) Physically-grounded Eikonal
relaxation that dynamically modulates geometric constraints based on local
radiance gradients, enabling detail preservation without sacrificing global
regularity. Unlike prior methods that handle these aspects through sequential
optimizations or isolated modules, our approach achieves cohesive integration
where appearance-geometry constraints evolve synergistically throughout
training. Comprehensive evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, including a 21.4% reduction in
Chamfer distance over reflection-aware baselines and 2.32 dB PSNR improvement
against neural rendering counterparts. Qualitative analyses reveal superior
capability in recovering specular instruments, urban layouts with
centimeter-scale infrastructure, and low-textured surfaces without local patch
collapse. The method's generalizability is further validated through successful
application to inverse rendering tasks, including material decomposition and
view-consistent relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT)方法，通过基于文本类别信息(TCI)的动态提示解决Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs)在基础任务和新任务间的Base-New Tradeoff (BNT)问题。CaPT可作为插件提升现有无条件提示调优方法的性能，实验证明其在11个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉图像信息(VII)的条件提示调优方法在解决BNT问题时表现不佳，甚至不如随机噪声条件提示。研究发现文本类别信息(TCI)是解决BNT问题的关键。

Method: 提出CaPT方法，通过学习基于TCI的动态提示，快速适应新类别。CaPT还可与无条件提示调优方法结合使用。进一步结合DePT框架，提出DeCaPT方法。

Result: 在11个数据集上，CaPT显著提升了五种无条件提示调优基线的性能，计算成本几乎可忽略。DeCaPT在平均H ACC上比现有最优条件提示调优方法高出3.49%。

Conclusion: CaPT通过TCI-conditioned提示有效解决了BNT问题，且具有高效性和通用性。DeCaPT进一步提升了性能，成为新的最优方法。

Abstract: Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large
Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often
struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better
tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes.
Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static
prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts,
improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work,
we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using
VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even
random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned
counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts
conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT
problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning
(CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by
learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be
used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT
schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently
improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with
negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT
with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT
approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art
conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets. Code:

TL;DR: VMoBA是一种针对视频扩散模型的稀疏注意力机制，通过动态分区和块选择显著提升训练和推理效率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频扩散模型中全注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，优化稀疏注意力方法以更好地捕捉视频数据的时空特性。

Method: 引入VMoBA，包括动态分区（1D-2D-3D）、全局块选择和基于阈值的块选择，以优化注意力模式。

Result: VMoBA在训练和推理中分别实现2.92x和2.40x的FLOPs加速，生成质量与全注意力相当或更优。

Conclusion: VMoBA为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效的稀疏注意力解决方案，显著提升了长序列和高分辨率视频的生成效率。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant
bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration,
high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been
proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not
optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video
data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block
Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for
VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within
pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,
varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA
enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a
layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to
diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global
block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions
across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to
dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative
similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly
accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and
1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation
quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance
in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for
high-res video generation.

Motivation: 多视图3D重建在计算机视觉中仍具挑战性，现有方法受限于训练数据的多样性和规模。

Method: 通过模拟多样化的相机轨迹和真实场景几何，Puzzles生成高质量数据，无需修改网络架构。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用10%原始数据并加入Puzzles，模型性能仍可与完整数据集训练结果媲美。

Conclusion: Puzzles是一种高效的数据增强方法，显著提升3D重建模型的性能和数据利用效率。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction remains a core challenge in computer vision.
Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps
from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters.
However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and
scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data
augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality
posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse
camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image
transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive
experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D
reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the
underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of
the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to
those trained on the full dataset. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法易受虚假相关性影响，导致模型鲁棒性不足，SPROD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SPROD通过后处理优化类别原型，减少虚假特征的偏差，适用于多种骨干网络和OOD检测场景。

Result: 在多个挑战性OOD数据集上，SPROD平均AUROC提升4.7%，FPR@95提升9.3%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPROD有效解决了虚假相关性对OOD检测的影响，具有广泛适用性和显著性能提升。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability
and safety of machine learning models in real-world applications, where they
frequently face data distributions unseen during training. Despite progress,
existing methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations that mislead
models and compromise robustness. To address this, we propose SPROD, a novel
prototype-based OOD detection approach that explicitly addresses the challenge
posed by unknown spurious correlations. Our post-hoc method refines class
prototypes to mitigate bias from spurious features without additional data or
hyperparameter tuning, and is broadly applicable across diverse backbones and
OOD detection settings. We conduct a comprehensive spurious correlation OOD
detection benchmarking, comparing our method against existing approaches and
demonstrating its superior performance across challenging OOD datasets, such as
CelebA, Waterbirds, UrbanCars, Spurious Imagenet, and the newly introduced
Animals MetaCoCo. On average, SPROD improves AUROC by 4.7% and FPR@95 by 9.3%
over the second best.

TL;DR: PriOr-Flow是一种新颖的双分支框架，通过正交视图的低失真特性提升全景光流估计性能，特别是在极地区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于透视的光流方法在全景投影（如ERP）中因严重失真而性能下降，尤其在极地区域。

Method: 提出DCCL操作符联合原始和正交成本体积信息，并设计ODDC模块迭代优化运动特征。

Result: PriOr-Flow在公开全景光流数据集上表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PriOr-Flow为宽视场运动估计设定了新基准，兼容多种透视光流方法。

Abstract: Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

Conclusion: VLM在超声图像分析中具有潜力，减少对大规模器官特定标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable object segmentation in ultrasound imaging remains
a significant challenge due to anatomical variability, diverse imaging
protocols, and limited annotated data. In this study, we propose a
prompt-driven vision-language model (VLM) that integrates Grounding DINO with
SAM2 to enable object segmentation across multiple ultrasound organs. A total
of 18 public ultrasound datasets, encompassing the breast, thyroid, liver,
prostate, kidney, and paraspinal muscle, were utilized. These datasets were
divided into 15 for fine-tuning and validation of Grounding DINO using Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) to the ultrasound domain, and 3 were held out entirely for
testing to evaluate performance in unseen distributions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
segmentation methods, including UniverSeg, MedSAM, MedCLIP-SAM, BiomedParse,
and SAMUS on most seen datasets while maintaining strong performance on unseen
datasets without additional fine-tuning. These results underscore the promise
of VLMs in scalable and robust ultrasound image analysis, reducing dependence
on large, organ-specific annotated datasets. We will publish our code on
code.sonography.ai after acceptance.

Result: SFCN在性别分类和年龄预测任务中均表现最佳，AUC达1.00（UKB）和0.85-0.91（外部数据集），年龄预测MAE为2.66-5.81。

Conclusion: 简单的卷积网络在脑影像分析中优于复杂架构，具有更好的泛化能力和区域一致性。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly outperforming classical
approaches in brain imaging, yet their generalizability across diverse imaging
cohorts remains inadequately assessed. As age and sex are key neurobiological
markers in clinical neuroscience, influencing brain structure and disease risk,
this study evaluates three of the existing three-dimensional architectures,
namely Simple Fully Connected Network (SFCN), DenseNet, and Shifted Window
(Swin) Transformers, for age and sex prediction using T1-weighted MRI from four
independent cohorts: UK Biobank (UKB, n=47,390), Dallas Lifespan Brain Study
(DLBS, n=132), Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n=108 healthy
controls), and Information eXtraction from Images (IXI, n=319). We found that
SFCN consistently outperformed more complex architectures with AUC of 1.00
[1.00-1.00] in UKB (internal test set) and 0.85-0.91 in external test sets for
sex classification. For the age prediction task, SFCN demonstrated a mean
absolute error (MAE) of 2.66 (r=0.89) in UKB and 4.98-5.81 (r=0.55-0.70) across
external datasets. Pairwise DeLong and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with
Bonferroni corrections confirmed SFCN's superiority over Swin Transformer
across most cohorts (p<0.017, for three comparisons). Explainability analysis
further demonstrates the regional consistency of model attention across cohorts
and specific to each task. Our findings reveal that simpler convolutional
networks outperform the denser and more complex attention-based DL
architectures in brain image analysis by demonstrating better generalizability
across different datasets.

Conclusion: 通过结构化概述，本文为更强大且与人类认知一致的多模态AI指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by
textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

Conclusion: VMDA通过双适配器设计显著提升了多模态跟踪的鲁棒性和判别性。

Abstract: Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress
by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality
features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often
struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues
across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative
representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but
effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from
auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency,
spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter
inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and
performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent
propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth,
and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at

Motivation: 理解分类模型为何对输入实例偏好某一类别是对比解释的挑战，研究旨在通过人类可理解的概念实现更可解释和鲁棒的AI系统。

Method: 利用实例嵌入的相似性和微调深度学习模型的概念相关性，提取概念及其相关性分数，计算相似实例的对比，并基于解释复杂性评估结果。

Result: 实验表明，概念相关性越高，解释越简短且复杂性越低；相关性越低，解释越冗长且分散。解释在不同图像增强下表现出不同程度的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding why a classification model prefers one class over another for
an input instance is the challenge of contrastive explanation. This work
implements concept-based contrastive explanations for image classification by
leveraging the similarity of instance embeddings and relevance of
human-understandable concepts used by a fine-tuned deep learning model. Our
approach extracts concepts with their relevance score, computes contrasts for
similar instances, and evaluates the resulting contrastive explanations based
on explanation complexity. Robustness is tested for different image
augmentations. Two research questions are addressed: (1) whether explanation
complexity varies across different relevance ranges, and (2) whether
explanation complexity remains consistent under image augmentations such as
rotation and noise. The results confirm that for our experiments higher concept
relevance leads to shorter, less complex explanations, while lower relevance
results in longer, more diffuse explanations. Additionally, explanations show
varying degrees of robustness. The discussion of these findings offers insights
into the potential of building more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个大规模真实世界数据集，用于个性化端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD），并通过视觉语言模型（VLM）和人工验证生成高质量偏好标注，为个性化E2EAD研究奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化在传统自动驾驶系统中已有研究，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2EAD）中却被忽视，而用户对齐行为对自动驾驶的信任和普及至关重要。缺乏标注多样化驾驶偏好的大规模数据集是主要挑战。

Method: 从真实道路拓扑中提取静态环境特征，使用微调的VLM推断动态上下文线索，构建一致且细粒度的场景。通过行为分布分析和规则启发式生成客观偏好标注，并利用VLM结合场景语义和驾驶员行为生成主观标注，最后通过人工验证融合两种标注。

Result: 提出了首个个性化E2EAD评估基准，实验表明结合个性化偏好的模型行为更接近人类驾驶。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化E2EAD提供了标准化平台，推动了以人为中心的自动驾驶研究。

Abstract: While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

Abstract: Zero-shot and prompt-based technologies capitalized on using frequently
occurring images to transform visual reasoning tasks, which explains why such
technologies struggle with valuable yet scarce scientific image sets. In this
work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed
to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop
lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation
on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and
heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of
our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging
Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded
membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an
average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a
Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an
IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results
mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding
and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in
isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for
scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated
datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental

according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also
consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that
jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的持续测试时适应方法，通过参数生成机制和领域感知适配器提升目标检测器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际环境中数据分布随时间空间变化，传统基于闭集假设的目标检测器难以适应，需要一种更高效的持续适应方法。

Method: 设计了双路径LoRA领域感知适配器分离特征，结合条件扩散参数生成机制和类中心最优传输对齐方法。

Result: 在多种连续域自适应目标检测任务中表现优异，生成的参数能捕捉更多目标相关信息。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了检测器的泛化能力，避免了性能退化。

Abstract: In practice, environments constantly change over time and space, posing
significant challenges for object detectors trained based on a closed-set
assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same distribution. To this
end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to
improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters,
e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images,
fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other
fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new
mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter
generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware
adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional
diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the
adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the
optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a
class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain
adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile,
visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated
parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the
generalization ability.

Motivation: 人类在跨模态概念混合中存在认知偏差（如设计固化），导致设计空间局部最优。IT-Blender旨在通过自动化混合过程解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型（SD和FLUX）混合干净参考图像和生成噪声图像的潜在表示，结合新颖的混合注意力机制，实现细节保留和解耦输入。

Result: IT-Blender在混合视觉和文本概念方面大幅优于基线方法，展示了图像生成模型在增强人类创造力中的新应用。

Conclusion: IT-Blender为跨模态概念混合提供了高效解决方案，为图像生成模型的新应用开辟了道路。

Abstract: Blending visual and textual concepts into a new visual concept is a unique
and powerful trait of human beings that can fuel creativity. However, in
practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive
biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space.
In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can
automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related
to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without
loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these
gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend
the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy
generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes
the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept
with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment
results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in
blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of
image generative models to augment human creativity.

TL;DR: WaRA是一种新的参数高效微调方法，利用小波变换分解权重更新矩阵，实现多分辨率分析，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩分解，忽略了局部或多尺度结构，无法捕捉复杂模式。

Method: WaRA通过小波变换将权重更新矩阵分解为多分辨率表示，在变换域进行低秩分解并通过逆变换重构更新。

Result: WaRA在视觉任务（如图像生成、分类、分割）中表现优异，同时降低计算复杂度，在语言任务中也有效。

Conclusion: WaRA是一种通用且高效的方法，适用于多种任务，代码已开源。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across
various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its
extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model
adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,
existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which
overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in
the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that
leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a
multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the
wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA
obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution
analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while
providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA
performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,
classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated
image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was
primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in
language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在从高斯溅射重建3D场景时，提取表面网格需要昂贵的后处理步骤，导致几何细节丢失或生成过于密集的网格。

Method: MILo设计了一种完全可微分的过程，直接从高斯参数构建网格，包括顶点位置和连接性，并引入了双向一致性框架、自适应网格提取和基于高斯的有符号距离计算方法。

Result: 该方法能够重建完整场景，质量达到最新水平，且所需网格顶点数量比之前方法少一个数量级。

Conclusion: MILo的轻量化和空内部结构使其非常适合物理模拟或动画等下游应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction
of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes
remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly
post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or
requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of
vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to
a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all
geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel
Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and
surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D
Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the
mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration
directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities
optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical
contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both
representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying
geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each
training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay
triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D
Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric
erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds,
with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh
vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior,
our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics
simulations or animation.

Conclusion: DenseWorld-1M为社区提供了一个大规模、详细且密集的标注数据集，解决了现有数据集的不足，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding
of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing
caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities.
Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed
descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution
images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first
massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design
a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed
object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains
entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level,
detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage.
The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational
dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality,
we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial
Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including
vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.

Result: 实验显示性能提升7.4% FVD，预测时长更长，并可作为实时运动规划器优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Epona在视频生成和运动规划方面表现优异，为自动驾驶世界建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video
generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling.
However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with
flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning.
This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint
distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially
constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose
Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized
spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled
spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from
fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video
prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an
end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration
generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to
address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes
longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model
further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end
planners on NAVSIM benchmarks. Code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion generative models significantly advanced
image, video, and 3D content creation from user-provided text prompts. However,
the challenging problem of dynamic 3D content generation (text-to-4D) with
diffusion guidance remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce
TextMesh4D, a novel framework for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Our
approach leverages per-face Jacobians as a differentiable mesh representation
and decomposes 4D generation into two stages: static object creation and
dynamic motion synthesis. We further propose a flexibility-rigidity
regularization term to stabilize Jacobian optimization under video diffusion
priors, ensuring robust geometric performance. Experiments demonstrate that
TextMesh4D achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of temporal consistency,
structural fidelity, and visual realism. Moreover, TextMesh4D operates with a
low GPU memory overhead-requiring only a single 24GB GPU-offering a
cost-effective yet high-quality solution for text-driven 4D mesh generation.

Abstract: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that
innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography
for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of
precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our
framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a
self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image
generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically
construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a
localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which
comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from
reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to
directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing
the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's
accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph
positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography,
Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in
digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Abstract: Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the
model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging
data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the
concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level
skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information
vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge
through pixel space optimization and existing core local information
identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset
distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level
refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency,
achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory
usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual
Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art,
demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple
dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with
ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the
method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and
50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and

Conclusion: RNeRV和超网络设计显著提升了INR视频压缩的性能和实用性，为实时编码提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have
recently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive
with traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network
training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical
adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the
components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in
terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.
We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a
state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When
all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7
different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared
to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then
tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of
hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle
training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the
weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher
quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at
0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by
0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar
speeds. Our project website is available at https://mgwillia.github.io/vinrb/

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应比特分配策略，用于直接训练的脉冲神经网络（SNN），通过分层分配资源提升效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多比特SNN在追求高效能和准确性的同时，面临内存和计算需求不成比例增长的问题。

Method: 通过参数化权重和脉冲的时间长度和比特宽度，使其可学习和可控，并提出改进的脉冲神经元和步长更新机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少内存和计算成本的同时提高了准确性，如在ImageNet上实现了2.69%的准确率提升和4.16倍的比特预算降低。

Conclusion: 自适应比特分配策略有效提升了SNN的效率和准确性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated
research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with
more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to
the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on
the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra
bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit
allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise
allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and
accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and
the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable
through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths
and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle
different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal
lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically
formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may
incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size
renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets,
including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and
DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and
computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our
SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit
budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully
open-sourced.

### [306] [Maximum Dispersion, Maximum Concentration: Enhancing the Quality of MOP Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22568)
*Gladston Moreira,Ivan Meneghini,Elzabeth Wanner*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标优化方法，通过结合目标空间的收敛性和决策空间的分散性，提高解的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标优化问题（MOPs）需要在冲突目标之间权衡，同时最大化目标空间的多样性和收敛性。传统方法可能导致解在决策空间中的聚类偏差。

Method: 定义了一个基于锥形的兴趣区域（ROI），反映决策者在目标空间的偏好，并使用均匀性度量增强决策空间的解分散性。

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法能有效平衡解的分散与集中，减少决策空间的偏差。

Conclusion: 结合目标空间收敛和决策空间分散的方法，提高了多目标优化的解质量，避免了聚类偏差。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) often require a trade-off
between conflicting objectives, maximizing diversity and convergence in the
objective space. This study presents an approach to improve the quality of MOP
solutions by optimizing the dispersion in the decision space and the
convergence in a specific region of the objective space. Our approach defines a
Region of Interest (ROI) based on a cone representing the decision maker's
preferences in the objective space, while enhancing the dispersion of solutions
in the decision space using a uniformity measure. Combining solution
concentration in the objective space with dispersion in the decision space
intensifies the search for Pareto-optimal solutions while increasing solution
diversity. When combined, these characteristics improve the quality of
solutions and avoid the bias caused by clustering solutions in a specific
region of the decision space. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method
enhances multi-objective optimization by generating solutions that effectively
balance dispersion and concentration, thereby mitigating bias in the decision
space.

*Robert Beinert,Jonas Bresch*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的高效去噪方法，适用于多二进制和Stiefel值数据，通过凸化技术简化求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理流形值数据（如颜色恢复、旋转信息等）时，现有方法需要扩展以适应新数据类型（如多二进制和Stiefel值数据）。

Method: 将数据嵌入欧几里得空间，通过半正定矩阵编码流形，并松弛秩约束以实现凸化，提出TV和Tikhonov去噪模型。

Result: 在合成实验中验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多二进制和Stiefel值数据的去噪提供了高效且易求解的解决方案。

Abstract: The handling of manifold-valued data, for instance, plays a central role in
color restoration tasks relying on circle- or sphere-valued color models, in
the study of rotational or directional information related to the special
orthogonal group, and in Gaussian image processing, where the pixel statistics
are interpreted as values on the hyperbolic sheet. Especially, to denoise these
kind of data, there have been proposed several generalizations of total
variation (TV) and Tikhonov-type denoising models incorporating the underlying
manifolds. Recently, a novel, numerically efficient denoising approach has been
introduced, where the data are embedded in an Euclidean ambient space, the
non-convex manifolds are encoded by a series of positive semi-definite,
fixed-rank matrices, and the rank constraint is relaxed to obtain a
convexification that can be solved using standard algorithms from convex
analysis. The aim of the present paper is to extent this approach to new kinds
of data like multi-binary and Stiefel-valued data. Multi-binary data can, for
instance, be used to model multi-color QR codes whereas Stiefel-valued data
occur in image and video-based recognition. For both new data types, we propose
TV- and Tikhonov-based denoising modelstogether with easy-to-solve
convexification. All derived methods are evaluated on proof-of-concept,
synthetic experiments.

Motivation: 肌肉的数量和质量对健康结果有重要预测作用，但MRI中精确量化肌肉仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用362例MRI数据（160名患者）开发模型，并在不同序列和异常情况下测试。

Result: 模型在常见序列中DSC为88.45%，在复杂序列中为86.21%。

Conclusion: 该模型可实现跨场景的自动化肌肉分割，促进肌肉与健康关系的研究。

Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important
predictors of health outcomes. While MRI offers a valuable modality for such
assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains
challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle
segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various
anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160
patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020)
were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The
model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common
sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of
88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and
abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise,
achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully
automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse
settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible
research into the relationship between musculature and health.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VERA的变分推理框架，用于黑盒越狱攻击，通过训练一个小型攻击者LLM来生成多样化的对抗性提示，无需重新优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖遗传算法和手动优化的提示池，无法全面评估模型漏洞，因此需要一种更高效的黑盒越狱方法。

Method: VERA将黑盒越狱问题转化为变分推理问题，训练攻击者LLM近似目标LLM的后验分布，从而生成多样化的对抗性提示。

Result: 实验表明，VERA在多种目标LLM上表现优异，验证了概率推理在对抗性提示生成中的价值。

Conclusion: VERA提供了一种高效且全面的黑盒越狱方法，为模型漏洞评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of API-only access to state-of-the-art LLMs highlights the need for
effective black-box jailbreak methods to identify model vulnerabilities in
real-world settings. Without a principled objective for gradient-based
optimization, most existing approaches rely on genetic algorithms, which are
limited by their initialization and dependence on manually curated prompt
pools. Furthermore, these methods require individual optimization for each
prompt, failing to provide a comprehensive characterization of model
vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VERA: Variational infErence
fRamework for jAilbreaking. VERA casts black-box jailbreak prompting as a
variational inference problem, training a small attacker LLM to approximate the
target LLM's posterior over adversarial prompts. Once trained, the attacker can
generate diverse, fluent jailbreak prompts for a target query without
re-optimization. Experimental results show that VERA achieves strong
performance across a range of target LLMs, highlighting the value of
probabilistic inference for adversarial prompt generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF对齐语言模型的拒绝-确认差距问题，并探索安全调优对内部表征的影响。

Method: 使用前向可计算分数结合KL惩罚和奖励偏移的轻量级代理，通过“排序-求和-停止”扫描快速生成短后缀。

Result: 攻击成功率从基线水平提升至80-100%，且后缀可泛化至未见过的提示和不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效，还揭示了安全调优的内部表征变化，为对齐研究提供了轻量级工具。

Abstract: We introduce logit-gap steering, a fast jailbreak framework that casts the
refusal-affirmation gap of RLHF-aligned language models as a single pass over
the vocabulary. A forward-computable score blends gap reduction with
lightweight proxies for KL penalty and reward shift, allowing a "sort-sum-stop"
sweep to complete in under a second and return a short suffix--two orders of
magnitude fewer model calls than beam or gradient attacks. The same suffix
generalises to unseen prompts and scales from 0.5 B to 70 B checkpoints,
lifting one-shot attack success from baseline levels to 80-100% while
preserving topical coherence. Beyond efficiency, these suffixes expose
sentence-boundary reward cliffs and other alignment artefacts, offering a
lightweight probe into how safety tuning reshapes internal representations.

Motivation: 现有自主网络安全防御（ACD）系统依赖静态网络假设，无法适应动态变化的网络拓扑，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 研究通过探索动态网络环境中的策略学习方法，开发通用自主网络安全防御（GACD）系统。

Result: 提出了一种能够在动态网络环境中学习和泛化的防御策略。

Conclusion: GACD系统有望提升网络安全防御的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In the face of evolving cyber threats such as malware, ransomware and
phishing, autonomous cybersecurity defense (ACD) systems have become essential
for real-time threat detection and response with optional human intervention.
However, existing ACD systems rely on limiting assumptions, particularly the
stationarity of the underlying network dynamics. In real-world scenarios,
network topologies can change due to actions taken by attackers or defenders,
system failures, or time evolution of networks, leading to failures in the
adaptive capabilities of current defense agents. Moreover, many agents are
trained on static environments, resulting in overfitting to specific
topologies, which hampers their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
network topologies. This work addresses these challenges by exploring methods
for developing agents to learn generalizable policies across dynamic network
environments -- general ACD (GACD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂多目标环境（如自动驾驶）中表现不足，需快速识别关键对象以生成相关解释。

Method: 提出注意力图生成器，突出关键帧中的重要对象，优化模型关注区域。

Result: 在DRAMA数据集上，BLEU、ROUGE、CIDEr和SPICE分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 目标注意力机制可增强实时自动驾驶中的解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework, DriveBLIP2, built upon the BLIP2-OPT
architecture, to generate accurate and contextually relevant explanations for
emerging driving scenarios. While existing vision-language models perform well
in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex,
multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial.
To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight
significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames.
By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention
map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better
understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations.
Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation
quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared
to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted
attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in
real-time autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Pix2G方法有效连接了人类可读的2D地图与机器人3D地图，提升了自主探索能力。

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly playing key roles as support platforms for
human operators in high-risk, dangerous applications. To accomplish challenging
tasks, an efficient human-robot cooperation and understanding is required.
While typically robotic planning leverages 3D geometric information, human
operators are accustomed to a high-level compact representation of the
environment, like top-down 2D maps representing the Building Information Model
(BIM). 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool to bridge the gap
between human readable 2D BIM and the robot 3D maps. In this work, we introduce
Pixels-to-Graph (Pix2G), a novel lightweight method to generate structured
scene graphs from image pixels and LiDAR maps in real-time for the autonomous
exploration of unknown environments on resource-constrained robot platforms. To
satisfy onboard compute constraints, the framework is designed to perform all
operation on CPU only. The method output are a de-noised 2D top-down
environment map and a structure-segmented 3D pointcloud which are seamlessly
connected using a multi-layer graph abstracting information from object-level
up to the building-level. The proposed method is quantitatively and
qualitatively evaluated during real-world experiments performed using the NASA
JPL NeBula-Spot legged robot to autonomously explore and map cluttered garage
and urban office like environments in real-time.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动的交通仿真方法依赖静态初始化或日志回放数据，无法动态模拟长期演变的交通场景。

Method: InfGen将整个场景表示为包括交通信号、车辆状态和运动向量的token序列，通过Transformer模型自回归生成交通状态和轨迹。

Result: 实验表明InfGen能生成真实、多样且自适应的交通行为，且在其生成的场景中训练的强化学习策略具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: InfGen是一个高保真度的自动驾驶仿真环境，支持无限场景生成。

Abstract: Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and
evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven
simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting
their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent
populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs
agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents
the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals,
agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate
traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents
into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate
that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors.
Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated
scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its
utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving. More

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对第二语言（L2）学习者的文本转语音（TTS）系统，通过调整元音时长差异提升清晰度，实验表明该方法显著降低了转录错误率，但用户感知与实际效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对第二语言学习者在语音识别中的困难，特别是元音时长差异导致的清晰度问题，设计了一种更有效的TTS系统。

Method: 利用美国英语中紧张元音（较长）和松弛元音（较短）的时长差异，在Matcha-TTS中创建“清晰模式”。

Result: 实验显示，清晰模式使法语母语的英语L2学习者的转录错误率至少降低9.15%，且用户认为该模式更具鼓励性和尊重性。然而，用户并未意识到其实际效果，仍认为整体慢速语音更清晰。此外，Whisper-ASR未能有效区分困难元音。

Conclusion: 实际清晰度与用户感知不一致，且现有ASR系统不足以评估TTS对L2学习者的清晰度效果。

Abstract: We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language
(L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense
(longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS.
Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer
(at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it
more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably,
listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error
rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words
was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not
correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that
Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult
vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for
these individuals.

Abstract: Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of
many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation
models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention

minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter
models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on
50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation
using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations.
Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity
points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97%
of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These
models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling
applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and
low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation
scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech
generation.

Motivation: 传统心血管磁共振在儿科和先天性心脏病中使用2D呼吸门控和3D静态成像，但存在耗时问题。本研究旨在通过深度学习快速生成3D电影数据集。

Method: 训练四个深度学习模型，分别用于对比校正、呼吸运动校正、超分辨率和分割。在10名患者中验证该方法。

Result: 成功将实时数据转换为3D电影，处理时间<1分钟，与常规成像结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法可显著加快临床心血管磁共振检查速度。

Abstract: Background: Conventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
paediatric and congenital heart disease uses 2D, breath-hold, balanced steady
state free precession (bSSFP) cine imaging for assessment of function and
cardiac-gated, respiratory-navigated, static 3D bSSFP whole-heart imaging for
anatomical assessment. Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing
real-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully
segmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were
trained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;
b) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice
direction); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,
RV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients
undergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on
prospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative
metrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D
cines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.
Results: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a
total post-processing time of <1 min in all cases. There were no significant
biases in any LV or RV metrics with reasonable limits of agreement and
correlation. There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,
although there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.
Conclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from
concatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models. Our method
has short acquisition and reconstruction times with fully segmented data being
available within 2 minutes. The good agreement with conventional imaging
suggests that our method could help to significantly speed up CMR in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 医学影像中设备与人群差异导致联邦学习模型效果下降，现有聚合方法无法适应多样化场景。

Method: FedCLAM结合客户端自适应动量、个性化抑制因子和强度对齐损失，优化模型训练。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，FedCLAM在医学分割任务中优于八种前沿方法。

Conclusion: FedCLAM有效解决了医学影像联邦学习中的特征差异问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized training approach that keeps data under
stakeholder control while achieving superior performance over isolated
training. While inter-institutional feature discrepancies pose a challenge in
all federated settings, medical imaging is particularly affected due to diverse
imaging devices and population variances, which can diminish the global model's
effectiveness. Existing aggregation methods generally fail to adapt across
varied circumstances. To address this, we propose FedCLAM, which integrates
\textit{client-adaptive momentum} terms derived from each client's loss
reduction during local training, as well as a \textit{personalized dampening
factor} to curb overfitting. We further introduce a novel \textit{intensity
alignment} loss that matches predicted and ground-truth foreground
distributions to handle heterogeneous image intensity profiles across
institutions and devices. Extensive evaluations on two datasets show that
FedCLAM surpasses eight cutting-edge methods in medical segmentation tasks,
underscoring its efficacy. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper reports IEEE International Conference on Multimedia \& Expo (ICME)
2025 Grand Challenge on Generalizable HDR and SDR Video Quality Measurement.
With the rapid development of video technology, especially High Dynamic Range
(HDR) and Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) contents, the need for robust and
generalizable Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods has become increasingly
demanded. Existing VQA models often struggle to deliver consistent performance
across varying dynamic ranges, distortion types, and diverse content. This
challenge was established to benchmark and promote VQA approaches capable of
jointly handling HDR and SDR content. In the final evaluation phase, five teams
submitted seven models along with technical reports to the Full Reference (FR)
and No Reference (NR) tracks. Among them, four methods outperformed VMAF
baseline, while the top-performing model achieved state-of-the-art performance,
setting a new benchmark for generalizable video quality assessment.

Conclusion: CA-Diff通过结合解剖特征和扩散模型，显著提升了脑MRI分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain structures from MRI is crucial for evaluating brain
morphology, yet existing CNN and transformer-based methods struggle to
delineate complex structures accurately. While current diffusion models have
shown promise in image segmentation, they are inadequate when applied directly
to brain MRI due to neglecting anatomical information. To address this, we
propose Collaborative Anatomy Diffusion (CA-Diff), a framework integrating
spatial anatomical features to enhance segmentation accuracy of the diffusion
model. Specifically, we introduce distance field as an auxiliary anatomical
condition to provide global spatial context, alongside a collaborative
diffusion process to model its joint distribution with anatomical structures,
enabling effective utilization of anatomical features for segmentation.
Furthermore, we introduce a consistency loss to refine relationships between
the distance field and anatomical structures and design a time adapted channel
attention module to enhance the U-Net feature fusion procedure. Extensive
experiments show that CA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Result: 在两个公开fMRI数据集上验证了HST的有效性，展示了其在疾病诊断和重建性能上的潜力。

Conclusion: HST为大脑动态表征提供了有前景的框架，有助于分析稳定性。

Abstract: Understanding brain dynamics through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience, particularly in
capturing how the brain transitions between various functional states.
Recently, metastability, which refers to temporarily stable brain states, has
offered a promising paradigm to quantify complex brain signals into
interpretable, discretized representations. In particular, compared to
cluster-based machine learning approaches, tokenization approaches leveraging
vector quantization have shown promise in representation learning with powerful
reconstruction and predictive capabilities. However, most existing methods
ignore brain transition dependencies and lack a quantification of brain
dynamics into representative and stable embeddings. In this study, we propose a
Hierarchical State space-based Tokenization network, termed HST, which
quantizes brain states and transitions in a hierarchical structure based on a
state space-based model. We introduce a refined clustered Vector-Quantization
Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) that incorporates quantization error feedback
and clustering to improve quantization performance while facilitating
metastability with representative and stable token representations. We validate
our HST on two public fMRI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
quantifying the hierarchical dynamics of the brain and its potential in disease
diagnosis and reconstruction performance. Our method offers a promising
framework for the characterization of brain dynamics, facilitating the analysis
of metastability.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征，难以捕捉区域特异性细节，可能导致异常被忽略。

Method: 1. 引入区域代表性令牌池化（R^2 Token Pooling）；2. 使用通用分割模型生成伪掩码；3. 提取患者特定属性并转换为文本提示。

Result: 在RadGenome-Chest CT上实现了最先进的性能，生成报告的自然语言质量和临床相关性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MedRegion-CT通过区域聚焦设计，有效提升了CT报告生成的准确性和临床实用性，代码已公开。

Abstract: The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based
report generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global
features, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may
cause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose
MedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)
framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region
Representative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained
vision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates
global tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens
highlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive
information effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates
pseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract
region-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant
regions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation
results to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,
diameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the
MLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous
evaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the
RadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and
clinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our
framework is publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏特异性标记，IHC染色受限于组织可用性和抗体特异性，虚拟染色技术可高效生成IHC图像，但现有方法仍面临分解染色风格与组织结构、可控染色过程及结构一致性建模等挑战。

Method: 设计了全局互信息引导的能量函数、时间步定制的反向扩散过程及局部互信息驱动的对比学习策略，以分解染色风格与组织结构、精确控制染色强度并确保细胞级结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，展现了其生物医学潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为虚拟染色提供了高效且可控的解决方案，代码将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining visualizes histology but lacks
specificity for diagnostic markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining
provides protein-targeted staining but is restricted by tissue availability and
antibody specificity. Virtual staining, i.e., computationally translating the
H&E image to its IHC counterpart while preserving the tissue structure, is
promising for efficient IHC generation. Existing virtual staining methods still
face key challenges: 1) effective decomposition of staining style and tissue
structure, 2) controllable staining process adaptable to diverse tissue and
proteins, and 3) rigorous structural consistency modelling to handle the
non-pixel-aligned nature of paired H&E and IHC images. This study proposes a
mutual-information (MI)-guided score-based diffusion model for unpaired virtual
staining. Specifically, we design 1) a global MI-guided energy function that
disentangles the tissue structure and staining characteristics across
modalities, 2) a novel timestep-customized reverse diffusion process for
precise control of the staining intensity and structural reconstruction, and 3)
a local MI-driven contrastive learning strategy to ensure the cellular level
structural consistency between H&E-IHC images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its biomedical potential. Codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: 多源数据中的域偏移（如成像协议、扫描仪和患者群体的差异）导致模型泛化能力下降。

Method: 引入Variance Risk Extrapolation (VREx) 减少域间风险方差，结合Mixup数据增强提升泛化和鲁棒性。

Result: 验证集上平均宏F1分数为0.96，表现优异。

Conclusion: VREx和Mixup结合有效提升跨域泛化能力，适用于多源医疗数据分类。

Abstract: We present our solution for the Multi-Source COVID-19 Detection Challenge,
which aims to classify chest CT scans into COVID and Non-COVID categories
across data collected from four distinct hospitals and medical centers. A major
challenge in this task lies in the domain shift caused by variations in imaging
protocols, scanners, and patient populations across institutions. To enhance
the cross-domain generalization of our model, we incorporate Variance Risk
Extrapolation (VREx) into the training process. VREx encourages the model to
maintain consistent performance across multiple source domains by explicitly
minimizing the variance of empirical risks across environments. This
regularization strategy reduces overfitting to center-specific features and
promotes learning of domain-invariant representations. We further apply Mixup
data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. Mixup interpolates
both the inputs and labels of randomly selected pairs of training samples,
encouraging the model to behave linearly between examples and enhancing its
resilience to noise and limited data. Our method achieves an average macro F1
score of 0.96 across the four sources on the validation set, demonstrating
strong generalization.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a major cause of death globally, and accurate early
diagnosis from electrocardiograms (ECGs) remains a clinical priority. Deep
learning models have shown promise for automated ECG interpretation, but
require large amounts of labeled data, which are often scarce in practice. We
propose a physiology-aware pipeline that (i) synthesizes 12-lead ECGs with
tunable MI morphology and realistic noise, and (ii) pre-trains recurrent and
transformer classifiers with self-supervised masked-autoencoding plus a joint
reconstruction-classification objective. We validate the realism of synthetic
ECGs via statistical and visual analysis, confirming that key morphological
features are preserved. Pretraining on synthetic data consistently improved
classification performance, particularly in low-data settings, with AUC gains
of up to 4 percentage points. These results show that controlled synthetic ECGs
can help improve MI detection when real clinical data is limited.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication among preterm
neonates, with portable X-ray imaging serving as the standard diagnostic
modality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). However, lung magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive alternative that avoids sedation
and radiation while providing detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms
of BPD. Leveraging high-resolution 3D MRI data, advanced image processing and
semantic segmentation algorithms can be developed to assist clinicians in
identifying the etiology of BPD. In this dataset, we present MRI scans paired
with corresponding semantic segmentations of the lungs and trachea for 40
neonates, the majority of whom are diagnosed with BPD. The imaging data consist
of free-breathing 3D stack-of-stars radial gradient echo acquisitions, known as
the StarVIBE series. Additionally, we provide comprehensive clinical data and
baseline segmentation models, validated against clinical assessments, to
support further research and development in neonatal lung imaging.

Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D
surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for
surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely
identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is
paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model
(VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for
real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a
novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce
a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything
model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented
language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more
in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose
semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of
semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and
semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization,
which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training,
particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to
demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves
the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by
enhancing surgical precision and safety. Our code is available at:

Result: 适量合成图像使FedAvg的AUC从0.9206提升至0.9237，FedProx从0.9429提升至0.9538。

Conclusion: 生成AI数据增强可有效提升联邦学习在乳腺癌超声图像分类中的性能，但需平衡合成与真实数据比例。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaboratively training deep learning models across institutions without
exchanging sensitive medical data. However, its effectiveness is often hindered
by limited data availability and non-independent, identically distributed data
across participating clients, which can degrade model performance and
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a generative AI based
data augmentation framework that integrates synthetic image sharing into the
federated training process for breast cancer diagnosis via ultrasound images.
Specifically, we train two simple class-specific Deep Convolutional Generative
Adversarial Networks: one for benign and one for malignant lesions. We then
simulate a realistic FL setting using three publicly available breast
ultrasound image datasets: BUSI, BUS-BRA, and UDIAT. FedAvg and FedProx are
adopted as baseline FL algorithms. Experimental results show that incorporating
a suitable number of synthetic images improved the average AUC from 0.9206 to
0.9237 for FedAvg and from 0.9429 to 0.9538 for FedProx. We also note that
excessive use of synthetic data reduced performance, underscoring the
importance of maintaining a balanced ratio of real and synthetic samples. Our
findings highlight the potential of generative AI based data augmentation to
enhance FL results in the breast ultrasound image classification task.

Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射，但噪声和伪影影响诊断准确性，现有方法在保留细节方面存在不足。

Method: FD-DiT采用扩散策略渐进引入噪声，结合频率解耦技术和高频噪声识别机制，通过混合去噪网络优化重建。

Result: 实验表明，FD-DiT在相同剂量下优于现有方法，显著抑制噪声和伪影。

Conclusion: FD-DiT为LDCT重建提供了一种高效方法，显著提升了图像质量和诊断准确性。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers
from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise,
potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion
models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless,
existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details.
To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT)
is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy
that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns
with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we
employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in
high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential
anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then
utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the
capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse
local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer
information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature
representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for
optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at
identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior
noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Echocardiography is routine for cardiac examination. However, 2D ultrasound
(US) struggles with accurate metric calculation and direct observation of 3D
cardiac structures. Moreover, 3D US is limited by low resolution, small field
of view and scarce availability in practice. Constructing the cardiac
anatomical twin from 2D images is promising to provide precise treatment
planning and clinical quantification. However, it remains challenging due to
the rare paired data, complex structures, and US noises. In this study, we
introduce a novel generative framework UltraTwin, to obtain cardiac anatomical
twin from sparse multi-view 2D US. Our contribution is three-fold. First,
pioneered the construction of a real-world and high-quality dataset containing
strictly paired multi-view 2D US and CT, and pseudo-paired data. Second, we
propose a coarse-to-fine scheme to achieve hierarchical reconstruction
optimization. Last, we introduce an implicit autoencoder for topology-aware
constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraTwin reconstructs
high-quality anatomical twins versus strong competitors. We believe it advances
anatomical twin modeling for potential applications in personalized cardiac
care.

Motivation: 由于MRI无电离辐射，在儿科疾病（如囊性纤维化）中优于CT，但目前缺乏针对肺部MRI的定量评分系统。

Method: APL评分包括图像加载、AI肺部分割、切片采样、像素级标注和量化报告五个步骤。

Conclusion: APL评分有望优化临床工作流程，并扩展至其他肺部MRI序列和疾病。

Abstract: Lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ultrashort echo-time (UTE)
represents a recent breakthrough in lung structure imaging, providing image
resolution and quality comparable to computed tomography (CT). Due to the
absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric
diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders
in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring
systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and
progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in
structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate
quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial
intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring
consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)
lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification
and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per
subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.
Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate
(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,
p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE
lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI
sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g.,

Abstract: Existing learning-based methods effectively reconstruct HDR images from
multi-exposure LDR inputs with extended dynamic range and improved detail, but
they rely more on empirical design rather than theoretical foundation, which
can impact their reliability. To address these limitations, we propose the
cross-iterative Alignment and Fusion deep Unfolding Network (AFUNet), where HDR
reconstruction is systematically decoupled into two interleaved subtasks --
alignment and fusion -- optimized through alternating refinement, achieving
synergy between the two subtasks to enhance the overall performance. Our method
formulates multi-exposure HDR reconstruction from a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
estimation perspective, explicitly incorporating spatial correspondence priors
across LDR images and naturally bridging the alignment and fusion subproblems
through joint constraints. Building on the mathematical foundation, we
reimagine traditional iterative optimization through unfolding -- transforming
the conventional solution process into an end-to-end trainable AFUNet with
carefully designed modules that work progressively. Specifically, each
iteration of AFUNet incorporates an Alignment-Fusion Module (AFM) that
alternates between a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) for alignment and a Channel
Fusion Module (CFM) for adaptive feature fusion, progressively bridging
misaligned content and exposure discrepancies. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate AFUNet's superior performance,
consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at:

### [334] [A Clinically-Grounded Two-Stage Framework for Renal CT Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23584)
*Renjie Liang,Zhengkang Fan,Jinqian Pan,Chenkun Sun,Russell Terry,Jie Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，用于从2D CT切片生成肾脏放射学报告，结合异常特征提取和视觉语言模型生成临床对齐的自然语言报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学影像的复杂性和临床文档的变异性，生成放射学报告具有挑战性。本研究旨在通过模块化方法提高报告的准确性和临床相关性。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型提取异常特征（如位置、大小、增强和衰减），然后将这些特征与CT图像输入微调的视觉语言模型，生成自然语言报告。

Result: 模型在所有异常类型上均优于随机基线，生成的报告能合理捕捉关键临床内容。

Conclusion: 研究证明了模块化、特征驱动的报告生成在肾脏影像中的可行性，未来将扩展到3D CT体积并提升临床保真度。

Abstract: Generating radiology reports from CT scans remains a complex task due to the
nuanced nature of medical imaging and the variability in clinical
documentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for generating
renal radiology reports from 2D CT slices. First, we extract structured
abnormality features using a multi-task learning model trained to identify
lesion attributes such as location, size, enhancement, and attenuation. These
extracted features are subsequently combined with the corresponding CT image
and fed into a fine-tuned vision-language model to generate natural language
report sentences aligned with clinical findings. We conduct experiments on a
curated dataset of renal CT studies with manually annotated
sentence-slice-feature triplets and evaluate performance using both
classification metrics and natural language generation metrics. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms random baselines across all
abnormality types, and the generated reports capture key clinical content with
reasonable textual accuracy. This exploratory work highlights the feasibility
of modular, feature-informed report generation for renal imaging. Future
efforts will focus on extending this pipeline to 3D CT volumes and further
improving clinical fidelity in multimodal medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据因隐私和监管限制难以获取，且标注成本高。合成数据生成是解决这些挑战的有效方案。

Method: 采用扩散模型生成合成胎儿头部超声图像及其分割掩膜，用于增强真实数据集并微调SAM模型。

Result: 合成数据能有效捕捉真实图像特征，使用少量真实图像对即可达到最先进的胎儿头部分割性能（Dice分数分别为94.66%和94.38%）。

Conclusion: 掩膜引导的生成AI方法在医学图像合成和分割任务中表现优异，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Medical image data is less accessible than in other domains due to privacy
and regulatory constraints. In addition, labeling requires costly,
time-intensive manual image annotation by clinical experts. To overcome these
challenges, synthetic medical data generation offers a promising solution.
Generative AI (GenAI), employing generative deep learning models, has proven
effective at producing realistic synthetic images. This study proposes a novel
mask-guided GenAI approach using diffusion models to generate synthetic fetal
head ultrasound images paired with segmentation masks. These synthetic pairs
augment real datasets for supervised fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). Our results show that the synthetic data captures real image features
effectively, and this approach reaches state-of-the-art fetal head
segmentation, especially when trained with a limited number of real image-mask
pairs. In particular, the segmentation reaches Dice Scores of 94.66\% and
94.38\% using a handful of ultrasound images from the Spanish and African
cohorts, respectively. Our code, models, and data are available on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中对大规模标注数据的依赖以及在低对比度和模糊边界等临床挑战场景中的分割精度问题。

Method: 提出MedSAM-CA，结合CBR-Net和Atte-FFB，前者通过卷积注意力增强边界细化，后者融合多级特征以提升边界准确性。

Conclusion: MedSAM-CA在低资源临床环境中表现出色，显著减少标注需求并提升分割精度。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and
treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for
precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment.
In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced
segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the
performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets,
which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy
concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios,
such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries
caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address
these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning
approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting
the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA
introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary
Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block
(Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover
boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms,
leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the
MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections
in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance
boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets
covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness
of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only
2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance,
demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MDPG的方法，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDMs）在MRI重建任务中提升数据一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）在生成高保真图像时因随机性表现不佳，而LDMs在潜在域中提供了紧凑且详细的先验知识，可有效指导模型学习原始数据分布。

Method: 构建了基于Visual-Mamba的主干网络，集成预训练的LDMs提供潜在域和图像域的条件先验，提出Latent Guided Attention（LGA）和Dual-domain Fusion Branch（DFB）进行多域融合，并采用k空间正则化策略。

Result: 在两个公开MRI数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MDPG通过多域扩散先验指导显著提升了MRI重建的数据一致性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is essential in medical
diagnostics. As the latest generative models, diffusion models (DMs) have
struggled to produce high-fidelity images due to their stochastic nature in
image domains. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) yield both compact and detailed
prior knowledge in latent domains, which could effectively guide the model
towards more effective learning of the original data distribution. Inspired by
this, we propose Multi-domain Diffusion Prior Guidance (MDPG) provided by
pre-trained LDMs to enhance data consistency in MRI reconstruction tasks.
Specifically, we first construct a Visual-Mamba-based backbone, which enables
efficient encoding and reconstruction of under-sampled images. Then pre-trained
LDMs are integrated to provide conditional priors in both latent and image
domains. A novel Latent Guided Attention (LGA) is proposed for efficient fusion
in multi-level latent domains. Simultaneously, to effectively utilize a prior
in both the k-space and image domain, under-sampled images are fused with
generated full-sampled images by the Dual-domain Fusion Branch (DFB) for
self-adaption guidance. Lastly, to further enhance the data consistency, we
propose a k-space regularization strategy based on the non-auto-calibration
signal (NACS) set. Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets fully
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The code is
available at https://github.com/Zolento/MDPG.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了超声操作的效率和诊断准确性，尤其在即时护理场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is widely accessible and radiation-free but has a steep
learning curve due to its dynamic nature and non-standard imaging planes.
Additionally, the constant need to shift focus between the US screen and the
patient poses a challenge. To address these issues, we integrate deep learning
(DL)-based semantic segmentation for real-time (RT) automated kidney volumetric
measurements, which are essential for clinical assessment but are traditionally
time-consuming and prone to fatigue. This automation allows clinicians to
concentrate on image interpretation rather than manual measurements.
Complementing DL, augmented reality (AR) enhances the usability of US by
projecting the display directly into the clinician's field of view, improving
ergonomics and reducing the cognitive load associated with screen-to-patient
transitions. Two AR-DL-assisted US pipelines on HoloLens-2 are proposed: one
streams directly via the application programming interface for a wireless
setup, while the other supports any US device with video output for broader
accessibility. We evaluate RT feasibility and accuracy using the Open Kidney
Dataset and open-source segmentation models (nnU-Net, Segmenter, YOLO with
MedSAM and LiteMedSAM). Our open-source GitHub pipeline includes model
implementations, measurement algorithms, and a Wi-Fi-based streaming solution,
enhancing US training and diagnostics, especially in point-of-care settings.

Result: 提升了模型在手术器械分割中的性能，增强了泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedST方案有效结合手术领域知识，显著提升了联邦学习在手术数据科学中的应用效果。

Abstract: Surgical instrument segmentation under Federated Learning (FL) is a promising
direction, which enables multiple surgical sites to collaboratively train the
model without centralizing datasets. However, there exist very limited FL works
in surgical data science, and FL methods for other modalities do not consider
inherent characteristics in surgical domain: i) different scenarios show
diverse anatomical backgrounds while highly similar instrument representation;
ii) there exist surgical simulators which promote large-scale synthetic data
generation with minimal efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized
FL scheme, Spatio-Temporal Representation Decoupling and Enhancement (FedST),
which wisely leverages surgical domain knowledge during both local-site and
global-server training to boost segmentation. Concretely, our model embraces a
Representation Separation and Cooperation (RSC) mechanism in local-site
training, which decouples the query embedding layer to be trained privately, to
encode respective backgrounds. Meanwhile, other parameters are optimized
globally to capture the consistent representations of instruments, including
the temporal layer to capture similar motion patterns. A textual-guided channel
selection is further designed to highlight site-specific features, facilitating
model adapta tion to each site. Moreover, in global-server training, we propose
Synthesis-based Explicit Representation Quantification (SERQ), which defines an
explicit representation target based on synthetic data to synchronize the model
convergence during fusion for improving model generalization.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TAG-WM的篡改感知生成图像水印方法，解决了AI生成内容（AIGC）的版权和真实性风险问题，同时提升了篡改鲁棒性和定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容（AIGC）的高效视觉创作能力带来了版权和真实性风险，现有无损视觉质量水印的篡改鲁棒性不足，且被动篡改检测方法难以应对高性能生成图像编辑应用的挑战。

Method: TAG-WM方法包括四个关键模块：双标记联合采样（DMJS）、水印潜在重建（WLR）、密集变化区域检测器（DVRD）和篡改感知解码（TAD）。

Result: 实验结果表明，TAG-WM在保持无损生成质量和256位容量的同时，实现了最先进的篡改鲁棒性和篡改定位能力。

Conclusion: TAG-WM为AI生成内容的版权保护和真实性验证提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises
copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity
verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a
potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable
of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention.
However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing
applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new
demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks
remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process,
necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid
iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making
proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks.
To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative
image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key
modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright
and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative
quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a
dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion
sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and
the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The
experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness
and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining
lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.

Abstract: In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and
novel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses

Result: 实验表明VoteSplat在开放词汇3D实例定位、点云理解等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VoteSplat为3D场景理解提供了一种高效且语义清晰的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become horsepower in high-quality, real-time
rendering for novel view synthesis of 3D scenes. However, existing methods
focus primarily on geometric and appearance modeling, lacking deeper scene
understanding while also incurring high training costs that complicate the
originally streamlined differentiable rendering pipeline. To this end, we
propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates
Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized
for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We
then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets
construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth
distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For
open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D
point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with
high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D
instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object
localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies. Our code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法在压缩和保真度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法架构无关，适用于任何高斯泼溅变体，并提供新的场景质量评估指标。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often
produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational
overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable
confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is
optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of
low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant.
In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the
quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs
between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are

Motivation: 现有视频稳定方法存在几何失真、过度裁剪和泛化能力差等问题，影响用户体验。

Method: GaVS利用3D相机姿态预测高斯Splatting基元，并通过多视角动态感知的光度监督和跨帧正则化进行微调，实现时间一致的局部重建和渲染。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中，GaVS优于现有2D和2.5D方法，用户研究也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: GaVS通过3D基础方法显著提升了视频稳定的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Video stabilization is pivotal for video processing, as it removes unwanted
shakiness while preserving the original user motion intent. Existing
approaches, depending on the domain they operate, suffer from several issues
(e.g. geometric distortions, excessive cropping, poor generalization) that
degrade the user experience. To address these issues, we introduce
\textbf{GaVS}, a novel 3D-grounded approach that reformulates video
stabilization as a temporally-consistent `local reconstruction and rendering'
paradigm. Given 3D camera poses, we augment a reconstruction model to predict
Gaussian Splatting primitives, and finetune it at test-time, with multi-view
dynamics-aware photometric supervision and cross-frame regularization, to
produce temporally-consistent local reconstructions. The model are then used to
render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid
frame cropping. Our method is evaluated on a repurposed dataset, instilled with
3D-grounded information, covering samples with diverse camera motions and scene
dynamics. Quantitatively, our method is competitive with or superior to
state-of-the-art 2D and 2.5D approaches in terms of conventional task metrics
and new geometry consistency. Qualitatively, our method produces noticeably
better results compared to alternatives, validated by the user study.

widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,
which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the
guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually
appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing
guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based
on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method
addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that
our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with
the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.
Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory
consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,
offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.

TL;DR: 研究利用眼动追踪数据和深度学习模型VTNet区分健康人群与轻度认知障碍（MCI），模型性能与类似研究相当，为自动化诊断工具开发提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球痴呆症患病率预计到2050年翻倍，亟需可扩展的诊断工具。

Method: 使用眼动追踪数据训练VTNet模型，结合时间序列和空间数据，并测试图像分辨率和任务表现对模型的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在700×700像素热图下达到68%敏感性和76%特异性，性能与类似研究相当。

Conclusion: 研究支持自动化MCI诊断工具开发，未来需优化模型并使用标准化长期视觉记忆任务。

Abstract: The global prevalence of dementia is projected to double by 2050,
highlighting the urgent need for scalable diagnostic tools. This study utilizes
digital cognitive tasks with eye-tracking data correlated with memory processes
to distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI), a precursor to dementia. A deep learning model based on VTNet was
trained using eye-tracking data from 44 participants (24 MCI, 20 HCs) who
performed a visual memory task. The model utilizes both time series and spatial
data derived from eye-tracking. It was modified to incorporate scan paths, heat
maps, and image content. These modifications also enabled testing parameters
such as image resolution and task performance, analyzing their impact on model
performance. The best model, utilizing $700\times700px$ resolution heatmaps,
achieved 68% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Despite operating under more
challenging conditions (e.g., smaller dataset size, shorter task duration, or a
less standardized task), the model's performance is comparable to an
Alzheimer's study using similar methods (70% sensitivity and 73% specificity).
These findings contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for
MCI. Future work should focus on refining the model and using a standardized
long-term visual memory task.

TL;DR: GaussMaster是一个基于LLM的数据库助手系统，旨在全面自动化数据库维护，减少人工干预，已在银行业成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自主数据库平台功能有限，仍需人工干预，GaussMaster旨在通过LLM技术实现全面自动化维护。

Method: 采用Tree-of-thought方法分析指标和日志，自动识别问题根源并调用工具解决。

Result: 在银行业34个数据库维护场景中实现零人工干预。

Conclusion: GaussMaster显著提升了数据库维护效率，展示了LLM在数据库管理中的潜力。

Abstract: In the financial industry, data is the lifeblood of operations, and DBAs
shoulder significant responsibilities for SQL tuning, database deployment,
diagnosis, and service repair. In recent years, both database vendors and
customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an
effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous
database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing
single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual
intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance.
GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based
database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to
assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide
comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit
abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire
maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of
metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes,
and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully
implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry,
where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance
scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks
with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.

Motivation: 探讨科学行为中继承与创新之间的张力是否反映在论文相似性与引用率的关系中。

Method: 引入密度（ρ）和不对称性（α）两个指标，使用贝叶斯分层回归分析53,000篇论文的引用率。

Result: 密度对引用率有微弱但显著的预测作用，不对称性无显著影响。

Conclusion: 论文语义相似性密度可为科学影响力提供信息性信号，不对称性则无预测价值。

Abstract: Scientific behavior is often characterized by a tension between building upon
established knowledge and introducing novel ideas. Here, we investigate whether
this tension is reflected in the relationship between the similarity of a
scientific paper to previous research and its eventual citation rate. To
operationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary
metrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic
neighborhood: (1) \emph{density} ($\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed
number of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those
papers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\alpha$), defined as
the average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.
We tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its
subsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,
surveying $\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five
different document embeddings. While the individual effects of $\rho$ on
citation count are small and variable, incorporating density-based predictors
consistently improves out-of-sample prediction when added to baseline models.
These results suggest that the density of a paper's surrounding scientific
literature may carry modest but informative signals about its eventual impact.
Meanwhile, we find no evidence that publication asymmetry improves model
predictions of citation rates. Our work provides a scalable framework for
linking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new
questions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the
dynamics of scientific reward.

*Yulun Jiang,Yekun Chai,Maria Brbić,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARBLE是一个多模态推理基准，旨在测试多模态语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂多模态问题中的逐步推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，表明复杂推理仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准多为文本或简单多模态问题，复杂多模态推理能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: MARBLE包含两个高难度任务（M-Portal和M-Cube），要求模型在空间、视觉和物理约束下进行多步规划。

Result: 12个先进模型在M-Portal上表现接近随机，M-Cube上准确率为0%，仅在简化子任务中部分模型优于随机基线。

Conclusion: MARBLE揭示了MLLMs在复杂多模态推理中的局限性，尤其是感知能力不足，希望推动下一代模型的开发。

Abstract: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason
through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial
intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only
reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly
retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning
remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a
challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize
multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason
step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is
composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the
crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and
physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE --
all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0%
accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the
random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for
existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where
MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By
shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the
development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and
plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

<details>

Motivation: 随着LLMs作为自主智能体的部署增加，理解其合作与社会机制对确保对齐性、鲁棒性和安全部署至关重要。

Method: 通过行为经济学中的公共物品游戏与制度选择，观察不同LLMs在重复互动中的行为模式。

Result: 发现四种行为模式：持续高合作、波动合作、逐渐衰退合作和固定策略。推理能力强的LLMs（如o1系列）合作表现较差，而传统LLMs合作水平较高。

Conclusion: 当前提升LLMs推理能力的方法不一定促进合作，为需要持续协作的环境部署LLM智能体提供了重要启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming
increasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and
collective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,
robustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of
costly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide
whether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize
defection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional
choice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs
navigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four
distinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and
sustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and
disengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and
others rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we
find that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with
cooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of
cooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving
LLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not
necessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM
agents in environments that require sustained collaboration. Our code is

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPTZero检测AI生成文本的可靠性，发现其对纯AI文本检测准确率高，但对人类文本的区分能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生使用AI工具的增加，教师依赖AI检测工具（如GPTZero）识别AI生成文本，但其可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 研究通过不同长度的随机提交论文（短、中、长）测试GPTZero的检测效果，数据集包括28篇AI生成和50篇人类撰写论文。

Result: AI生成文本检测准确率高达91-100%，但人类文本存在误判，表明GPTZero在区分人类文本时可靠性有限。

Conclusion: 教育者应谨慎依赖AI检测工具，因其对人类文本的识别能力不足。

Abstract: As the use of AI tools by students has become more prevalent, instructors
have started using AI detection tools like GPTZero and QuillBot to detect AI
written text. However, the reliability of these detectors remains uncertain. In
our study, we focused mostly on the success rate of GPTZero, the most-used AI
detector, in identifying AI-generated texts based on different lengths of
randomly submitted essays: short (40-100 word count), medium (100-350 word
count), and long (350-800 word count). We gathered a data set consisting of
twenty-eight AI-generated papers and fifty human-written papers. With this
randomized essay data, papers were individually plugged into GPTZero and
measured for percentage of AI generation and confidence. A vast majority of the
AI-generated papers were detected accurately (ranging from 91-100% AI believed
generation), while the human generated essays fluctuated; there were a handful
of false positives. These findings suggest that although GPTZero is effective
at detecting purely AI-generated content, its reliability in distinguishing
human-authored texts is limited. Educators should therefore exercise caution
when relying solely on AI detection tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM基准测试在评估长链推理能力时存在不足，如缺乏难度和多样性、易受猜测和记忆影响、对中间推理步骤评估不足。

Method: 通过从多个学科和难度级别筛选问题，采用开放形式和多模型投票技术消除捷径，并设计基于参考的三元评分机制评估推理步骤。

Result: MMReason成功评估了主流MLLM的推理能力，并提供了详细分析。

Conclusion: MMReason为推进MLLM推理研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Reasoning plays a crucial role in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) toward Artificial General Intelligence. However, existing MLLM
benchmarks often fall short in precisely and comprehensively evaluating
long-chain reasoning abilities from three key aspects: (1) lack of difficulty
and diversity, (2) susceptibility to guessability and memorization, (3)
inadequate assessment of intermediate reasoning steps. To fill this gap, we
introduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively
evaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,
challenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring
multi-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple
difficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from
foundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated
into an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to
eliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust
reasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed
step-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism
to reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps. With MMReason, we benchmark
popular leading MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their reasoning
capabilities. We hope MMReason will serve as a valuable resource for advancing
MLLM reasoning research. Code will be available at

lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable
Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖人工标注和领域特定奖励设计，SPIRAL旨在通过自博弈消除这一需求，实现自主推理能力开发。

Method: SPIRAL采用在线多轮多智能体强化学习系统，提出角色条件优势估计（RAE）稳定训练，通过自博弈生成渐进式挑战性问题。

Result: 在Kuhn Poker上训练的模型在数学和通用推理任务上分别提升8.6%和8.4%，多游戏训练进一步强化性能。

Conclusion: 零和游戏能自然培养可迁移的推理能力，为自主推理开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can
develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable
rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and
domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework
where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously
improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.
Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively
challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To
enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,
multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose
role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.
Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that
transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%
improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000
expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through
three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,
and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple
Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct
reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model
(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These
results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable
reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous
reasoning development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RMT的新模型，通过用外积记忆矩阵替换Transformer的残差流，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进Transformer中残差流的信息存储和检索机制，以提升模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 用外积记忆矩阵（Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972）替换Transformer的残差流，构建RMT模型。

Result: RMT在性能、计算效率和参数数量上均优于传统Transformer，且在下游任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: RMT通过优化残差流的设计，实现了更高效的扩展和性能提升，为Transformer架构提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: The residual stream acts as a memory bus where transformer layers both store
and access features (Elhage et al., 2021). We consider changing the mechanism
for retrieving and storing information in the residual stream, and replace the
residual stream of the transformer with an outer product memory matrix
(Kohonen, 1972, Anderson, 1972). We call this model the Residual Matrix
Transformer (RMT). We find that the RMT enjoys a number of attractive
properties: 1) the size of the residual stream can be scaled independently of
compute and model size, improving performance, 2) the RMT can achieve the same
loss as the transformer with 58% fewer FLOPS, 25% fewer parameters, and 41%
fewer training tokens tokens, and 3) the RMT outperforms the transformer on
downstream evaluations. We theoretically analyze the transformer and the RMT,
and show that the RMT allows for more efficient scaling of the residual stream,
as well as improved variance propagation properties. Code for this project can
be found at https://github.com/bmac3/residual-matrix-transformer.

TL;DR: BEST-Route是一种新的LLM查询路由框架，通过根据查询难度和质量阈值选择模型和响应数量，显著降低成本且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署成本高，现有路由方法因仅生成单一响应而过度依赖昂贵模型，未能充分利用低成本模型的潜力。

Method: 提出BEST-Route框架，动态选择模型和响应数量，利用低成本模型生成多个响应并选择最佳，以平衡成本与质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据集上可降低成本达60%，性能下降不足1%。

Conclusion: BEST-Route通过优化模型选择和响应数量，实现了成本与性能的高效权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools but are often expensive to
deploy at scale. LLM query routing mitigates this by dynamically assigning
queries to models of varying cost and quality to obtain a desired trade-off.
Prior query routing approaches generate only one response from the selected
model and a single response from a small (inexpensive) model was often not good
enough to beat a response from a large (expensive) model due to which they end
up overusing the large model and missing out on potential cost savings.
However, it is well known that for small models, generating multiple responses
and selecting the best can enhance quality while remaining cheaper than a
single large-model response. We leverage this idea to propose BEST-Route, a
novel routing framework that chooses a model and the number of responses to
sample from it based on query difficulty and the quality thresholds.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method reduces costs by
up to 60% with less than 1% performance drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用Transformer不确定性方法无法满足下游任务的需求，BayesLoRA旨在提供更贴合实际工作流的不确定性评估。

Method: 通过数学和实证分析，将MC-Dropout集成到LoRA适配器中，量化其在微调分布外的方差放大现象。

Result: BayesLoRA能够为智能体决策提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: BayesLoRA为下游任务提供了有效的不确定性量化工具，支持智能体在不确定性下的行为调整。

Abstract: We propose BayesLoRA, a task-specific uncertainty quantification framework
that integrates MC-Dropout into Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). Unlike
general-purpose transformer uncertainty methods, BayesLoRA provides guardrails
tailored to downstream workflows, enabling agents to introspect and modulate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Gated Linear Units (GLUs)因使用独立权重矩阵导致的内存读取效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出了Mixture of Element-wise Gating (MoEG)架构和FlashMGLU内核，前者通过共享权重矩阵和二进制掩码减少内存传输，后者优化了硬件实现。

Result: MGLUs在RTX5090 GPU上实现了19.7倍的推理速度提升，内存效率提高47%，速度提升34%，并在下游任务中保持或超越基线模型的准确性。

Conclusion: MGLUs是一种高效且性能优越的GLUs替代方案，特别适合大型语言模型。

Abstract: Gated Linear Units (GLUs) have become essential components in the
feed-forward networks of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, they require twice as many memory reads compared to feed-forward
layers without gating, due to the use of separate weight matrices for the gate
and value streams. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Masked Gated Linear
Units (MGLUs), a novel family of GLUs with an efficient kernel implementation.
The core contribution of MGLUs include: (1) the Mixture of Element-wise Gating
(MoEG) architecture that learns multiple binary masks, each determining gate or
value assignments at the element level on a single shared weight matrix
resulting in reduced memory transfer, and (2) FlashMGLU, a hardware-friendly
kernel that yields up to a 19.7 $\times$ inference-time speed-up over a naive
PyTorch MGLU and is 47% more memory-efficient and 34% faster than standard GLUs
despite added architectural complexity on an RTX5090 GPU. In LLM experiments,
the Swish-activated variant SwiMGLU preserves its memory advantages while
matching - or even surpassing - the downstream accuracy of the SwiGLU baseline.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have generated significant excitement, a

Here, we establish a conceptual distinction that reconciles competing
narratives surrounding SAEs. We argue that while SAEs may be less effective for
acting on known concepts, SAEs are powerful tools for discovering unknown
concepts. This distinction cleanly separates existing negative and positive
results, and suggests several classes of SAE applications. Specifically, we
outline use cases for SAEs in (i) ML interpretability, explainability,
fairness, auditing, and safety, and (ii) social and health sciences.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM（大语言模型）代理如何通过自动翻译数据格式和交互界面，实现开放的通用互操作性，打破封闭平台的垄断，但也带来新的安全风险和技术债务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前互联网应用层由封闭平台主导，缺乏开放互操作性，而LLM代理可以低成本实现通用互操作性，打破垄断，促进数据可移植性。

Method: 提出利用LLM代理自动翻译数据格式和交互界面，实现AI介导的通用互操作性。

Result: 通用互操作性削弱垄断行为，但也可能引发安全风险和技术债务。

Conclusion: ML社区应积极应对这一趋势，建立框架以降低风险，利用AI恢复用户自由和市场竞争。

Abstract: While the Internet's core infrastructure was designed to be open and
universal, today's application layer is dominated by closed, proprietary
platforms. Open and interoperable APIs require significant investment, and
market leaders have little incentive to enable data exchange that could erode
their user lock-in. We argue that LLM-based agents fundamentally disrupt this
status quo. Agents can automatically translate between data formats and
interact with interfaces designed for humans: this makes interoperability
dramatically cheaper and effectively unavoidable. We name this shift universal
interoperability: the ability for any two digital services to exchange data
seamlessly using AI-mediated adapters. Universal interoperability undermines
monopolistic behaviours and promotes data portability. However, it can also
lead to new security risks and technical debt. Our position is that the ML
community should embrace this development while building the appropriate
frameworks to mitigate the downsides. By acting now, we can harness AI to
restore user freedom and competitive markets without sacrificing security.

### [365] [Riemannian-Geometric Fingerprints of Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22802)
*Hae Jin Song,Laurent Itti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于黎曼几何的生成模型指纹定义和计算方法，用于区分不同生成模型及其生成内容，解决了模型归属和数据真实性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛应用，模型归属和生成内容的真实性成为重要问题。服务提供商需要保护知识产权，用户和执法机构需要验证内容来源。此外，模型崩溃的威胁增加，需要区分合成与人类数据。

Method: 采用黎曼几何方法，定义了生成模型的指纹，利用微分几何理论，提出了一种基于梯度的算法计算指纹。

Result: 该方法在区分多种生成模型（涵盖4个数据集、27种架构、2种模态）上表现优异，显著提升了模型归属性能，并具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼几何框架为生成模型指纹提供了理论基础和实用工具，解决了模型归属和数据真实性的问题。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs and rapid integration of generative models (GMs) have
sparked interest in the problem of model attribution and their fingerprints.
For instance, service providers need reliable methods of authenticating their
models to protect their IP, while users and law enforcement seek to verify the
source of generated content for accountability and trust. In addition, a
growing threat of model collapse is arising, as more model-generated data are
being fed back into sources (e.g., YouTube) that are often harvested for
training ("regurgitative training"), heightening the need to differentiate
synthetic from human data. Yet, a gap still exists in understanding generative
models' fingerprints, we believe, stemming from the lack of a formal framework
that can define, represent, and analyze the fingerprints in a principled way.
To address this gap, we take a geometric approach and propose a new definition
of artifact and fingerprint of GMs using Riemannian geometry, which allows us
to leverage the rich theory of differential geometry. Our new definition
generalizes previous work (Song et al., 2024) to non-Euclidean manifolds by
learning Riemannian metrics from data and replacing the Euclidean distances and
nearest-neighbor search with geodesic distances and kNN-based Riemannian center
of mass. We apply our theory to a new gradient-based algorithm for computing
the fingerprints in practice. Results show that it is more effective in
distinguishing a large array of GMs, spanning across 4 different datasets in 2
different resolutions (64 by 64, 256 by 256), 27 model architectures, and 2
modalities (Vision, Vision-Language). Using our proposed definition
significantly improves the performance on model attribution, as well as a
generalization to unseen datasets, model types, and modalities, suggesting its
practical efficacy.

Result: 方法使学生模型能够从最强预训练模型中受益，提升知识蒸馏效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了强预训练模型知识转移效率低的问题，尤其适用于小规模或高度不平衡数据集。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from pretrained visual representation models offers an
effective approach to improve small, task-specific production models. However,
the effectiveness of such knowledge transfer drops significantly when
distilling from strong models that are pretrained in a large scale. In this
paper, we address this challenge for pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) by
exploring methods to fine-tune them for more effective knowledge transfer.
Motivated by the connection between mutual information and distillation
effectiveness, we propose to employ mutual information-aware optimization
during finetuning. For small or highly-imbalanced downstream datasets where
such optimization becomes less effective, we introduce a simple yet effective
heuristic of reweighting MLP blocks. This approach is inspired by our
observation that top MLP blocks are primarily responsible for mutual
information loss. Our method enables small student models to benefit from those
pretrained models among the strongest.

Motivation: 医疗AI中隐私保护至关重要，但现有方法难以从多模态架构中移除敏感数据。

Method: 提出Forget-MI，通过损失函数和扰动技术移除需遗忘数据的单模态和联合表示。

Result: Forget-MI在遗忘数据集上表现优异，MIA降低0.202，AUC和F1分数分别降低0.221和0.305，测试集性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: Forget-MI在隐私保护和模型性能间取得平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Privacy preservation in AI is crucial, especially in healthcare, where models
rely on sensitive patient data. In the emerging field of machine unlearning,
existing methodologies struggle to remove patient data from trained multimodal
architectures, which are widely used in healthcare. We propose Forget-MI, a
novel machine unlearning method for multimodal medical data, by establishing
loss functions and perturbation techniques. Our approach unlearns unimodal and
joint representations of the data requested to be forgotten while preserving
knowledge from the remaining data and maintaining comparable performance to the
original model. We evaluate our results using performance on the forget
dataset, performance on the test dataset, and Membership Inference Attack
(MIA), which measures the attacker's ability to distinguish the forget dataset
from the training dataset. Our model outperforms the existing approaches that
aim to reduce MIA and the performance on the forget dataset while keeping an
equivalent performance on the test set. Specifically, our approach reduces MIA
by 0.202 and decreases AUC and F1 scores on the forget set by 0.221 and 0.305,
respectively. Additionally, our performance on the test set matches that of the
retrained model, while allowing forgetting. Code is available at

Result: 通过智能手机传感器记录的三人真实驾驶数据验证了包的有效性。

Conclusion: maneuverRecognition包为驾驶行为识别提供了实用工具，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: In the domain of vehicle telematics the automated recognition of driving
maneuvers is used to classify and evaluate driving behaviour. This not only
serves as a component to enhance the personalization of insurance policies, but
also to increase road safety, reduce accidents and the associated costs as well
as to reduce fuel consumption and support environmentally friendly driving. In
this context maneuver recognition technically requires a continuous application
of time series classification which poses special challenges to the transfer,
preprocessing and storage of telematic sensor data, the training of predictive
models, and the prediction itself. Although much research has been done in the
field of gathering relevant data or regarding the methods to build predictive
models for the task of maneuver recognition, there is a practical need for
python packages and functions that allow to quickly transform data into the
required structure as well as to build and evaluate such models. The
maneuverRecognition package was therefore developed to provide the necessary
functions for preprocessing, modelling and evaluation and also includes a ready
to use LSTM based network structure that can be modified. The implementation of
the package is demonstrated using real driving data of three different persons
recorded via smartphone sensors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于统计学习的方法SGKI，用于图像修复和超分辨率问题中的缺失像素估计，并提供不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像修复和超分辨率中缺失像素估计的问题，并量化估计的不确定性。

Method: 基于再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）的假设，提出SGKI方法，扩展了现有核方法，并利用Schur补高效计算非渐近置信带。

Result: SGKI不仅能估计缺失像素，还能为所有缺失像素构建同时保证的非渐近置信带，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SGKI方法在图像修复和超分辨率任务中表现优异，同时提供了可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: The paper proposes a statistical learning approach to the problem of
estimating missing pixels of images, crucial for image inpainting and
super-resolution problems. One of the main novelties of the method is that it
also provides uncertainty quantifications together with the estimated values.
Our core assumption is that the underlying data-generating function comes from
a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A special emphasis is put on
band-limited functions, central to signal processing, which form Paley-Wiener
type RKHSs. The proposed method, which we call Simultaneously Guaranteed Kernel
Interpolation (SGKI), is an extension and refinement of a recently developed
kernel method. An advantage of SGKI is that it not only estimates the missing
pixels, but also builds non-asymptotic confidence bands for the unobserved
values, which are simultaneously guaranteed for all missing pixels. We also
show how to compute these bands efficiently using Schur complements, we discuss
a generalization to vector-valued functions, and we present a series of
numerical experiments on various datasets containing synthetically generated
and benchmark images, as well.

TL;DR: SMART是一种轻量级、数据高效的后处理校准方法，通过基于logit间隙的精确调整，解决了神经网络过度自信的问题，并在有限数据下实现高性能校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在预测准确性上有所提升，但仍存在系统性过度自信问题，尤其在安全关键场景中风险较大。现有校准方法面临全局调整偏差大或高维度噪声导致的方差高的困境。

Method: SMART通过logit间隙（top两个logit的差）作为去噪标量信号，结合SoftECE目标函数，自适应平衡偏差和方差，实现高效校准。

Result: SMART在多种数据集和架构上表现出色，参数更少但校准性能达到最优，适用于实际不确定性量化。

Conclusion: SMART为神经网络预测提供了一种高效、鲁棒的校准解决方案，尤其适合数据有限场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved predictive
accuracy. However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,
posing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc
calibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like
Temperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing
high bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that
operate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy
high-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these
challenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature
(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely
scales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the
logit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal
directly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator
that avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while
preserving model prediction invariance. Meanwhile, SMART employs a novel
soft-binned Expected Calibration Error (SoftECE) objective that balances model
bias and variance through adaptive binning, enabling stable parameter updates
even with extremely limited calibration data. Extensive evaluations across
diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves
state-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer
parameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,
robust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification
in neural network predictions. The source code is available at:

Result: 在多种挑战性联邦学习场景中表现优于现有方法，尤其是在极端数据异构和低比特通信情况下。

Conclusion: FedWSQ有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key
challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address
these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which
integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware
non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out
biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the
robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client
participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging
the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ
significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model
accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging
FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit
communication scenarios.

Abstract: Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them
requires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent
these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated
images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a
valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when
these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable
detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable
in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.
We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion
models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing
watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are
either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the
noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,
despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and
efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To
overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for
IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in
large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our
extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in
preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and
preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.

Abstract: The development of semi-supervised learning (SSL) has in recent years largely
focused on the development of new consistency regularization or entropy
minimization approaches, often resulting in models with complex training
strategies to obtain the desired results. In this work, we instead propose a
novel approach that explicitly incorporates the underlying clustering
assumption in SSL through extending a recently proposed differentiable
clustering module. Leveraging annotated data to guide the cluster centroids
results in a simple end-to-end trainable deep SSL approach. We demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the performance over the supervised-only baseline
and show that our framework can be used in conjunction with other SSL methods
to further boost their performance.

Motivation: 当前TTA研究存在结果重复、评估指标有限、实验设置不一致和分析不足等问题，阻碍了公平比较和实际应用。

Method: TTA-VLM实现了8种情景TTA和7种在线TTA方法，并在15个数据集上评估，扩展了模型范围（如SigLIP）和评估指标（如鲁棒性、校准等）。

Result: 实验发现现有TTA方法改进有限，与训练时调优方法协作性差，且准确性提升常以模型可信度下降为代价。

Conclusion: TTA-VLM为TTA方法提供了公平比较和全面评估，鼓励开发更可靠和通用的策略。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for
enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during
inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA
researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of
baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental
settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons
between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To
address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7
online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates
them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on
CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid
loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA
to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates
various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,
out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic
assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)
existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering
work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time
fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced
model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and
comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the
community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于单模态和跨模态基线，证明了多模态对齐的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态对比学习显著提升了时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs,
which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense
and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing
time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain
limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual
intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this
paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms
raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than
using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities
directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared
semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer
and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate
selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the
most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments
on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that
our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal
baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing
time series forecasting. Code is available at:

Result: 对称群下的VASS可达性问题可在PSPACE内解决，而一般VASS的复杂度为Ackermannian。

Conclusion: 对称性显著降低了VASS的可达性问题的复杂度，为数据VASS的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the reachability problem in symmetric vector addition systems
with states (VASS), where transitions are invariant under a group of
permutations of coordinates. One extremal case, the trivial groups, yields
general VASS. In another extremal case, the symmetric groups, we show that the
reachability problem can be solved in PSPACE, regardless of the dimension of
input VASS (to be contrasted with Ackermannian complexity in general VASS). We
also consider other groups, in particular alternating and cyclic ones.
Furthermore, motivated by the open status of the reachability problem in data
VASS, we estimate the gain in complexity when the group arises as a combination
of the trivial and symmetric groups.

Abstract: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical
language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable
tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art
multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating
the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language
confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a
methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in
any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves
continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a
novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support
standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research
introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to
28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while
preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian
benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready
response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the
verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation
framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages.
This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce industry has become integral to people's daily
lives, leveraging technological advancements to offer personalized shopping
experiences, primarily through recommendation systems that enhance customer
engagement through personalized suggestions. To improve customers' experience
in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for
outfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for
outfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item

recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance
the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate
algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial
needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on
framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining
realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module
empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the

Motivation: 评估当前大型语言模型（如GPT-4）回答复杂政策问题的潜力，并研究气候紧急运动对地方政府政策的具体影响。

Method: 构建PALLM系统，使用GPT-4分析维多利亚州11个地方政府的政策文件，并通过政策制定者验证系统性能。随后进行大规模政策文件分析，比较通过和未通过CED的政府。

Result: GPT-4能进行高级政策分析，但存在可靠性问题。通过CED的政府更可能拥有近期和针对性的气候政策，并更关注紧迫性、优先级及社会公平。

Conclusion: 大规模政策文件分析为政策研究提供了新机会，但需解决模型可靠性问题。

Abstract: This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local
government climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency
movement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through
the mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series
of commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the
aim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer
complex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM
(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.
This system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency
response plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the
performance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by
generating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria
and assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.
Having established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to
conduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local
governments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the
methodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils
which have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is
capable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of
reliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.
Its use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more
likely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to
urgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which
have not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale
opens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.

### [380] [Theories of "Sexuality" in Natural Language Processing Bias Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22481)
*Jacob Hobbs*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文分析了NLP系统中对性取向的编码和误表示问题，发现文献中缺乏明确定义，且常混淆性别与性取向，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NLP技术如何反映和放大社会偏见，尤其是性取向偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过调查和分析55篇量化性取向偏见的NLP文献，评估性取向的定义和操作方式。

Result: 发现文献中性取向定义模糊，常依赖规范假设，且性别与性取向常被混淆。

Conclusion: 建议更深入地与酷儿社区和跨学科文献合作，以改进性取向偏见的分析。

Abstract: In recent years, significant advancements in the field of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have positioned commercialized language models as
wide-reaching, highly useful tools. In tandem, there has been an explosion of
multidisciplinary research examining how NLP tasks reflect, perpetuate, and
amplify social biases such as gender and racial bias. A significant gap in this
scholarship is a detailed analysis of how queer sexualities are encoded and
(mis)represented by both NLP systems and practitioners. Following previous work
in the field of AI fairness, we document how sexuality is defined and
operationalized via a survey and analysis of 55 articles that quantify
sexuality-based NLP bias. We find that sexuality is not clearly defined in a
majority of the literature surveyed, indicating a reliance on assumed or
normative conceptions of sexual/romantic practices and identities. Further, we
find that methods for extracting biased outputs from NLP technologies often
conflate gender and sexual identities, leading to monolithic conceptions of
queerness and thus improper quantifications of bias. With the goal of improving
sexuality-based NLP bias analyses, we conclude with recommendations that
encourage more thorough engagement with both queer communities and
interdisciplinary literature.

TL;DR: 研究发现，标准生成参数的变化对LLM的政治倾向测试分数影响不大，但提示变化和微调会显著影响分数。此外，模型在政治内容较多的数据集上微调时，分数并未有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨政治倾向测试（PCT）在量化LLM政治倾向时的有效性，以及外部因素对测试结果的影响。

Method: 通过分析标准生成参数、提示变化和微调对PCT分数的影响，验证测试的有效性。

Result: 标准生成参数变化对分数影响不显著，但提示和微调会显著影响分数；政治内容较多的微调数据集未导致分数差异。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究PCT测试的有效性及LLM中政治倾向的编码机制。

Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to
quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that
examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard
generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores.
However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning
individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that
when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than
others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a
thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as
the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.

### [382] [Mitigating Gambling-Like Risk-Taking Behaviors in Large Language Models: A Behavioral Economics Approach to AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22496)
*Y. Du*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RARG的框架，用于识别和减少大语言模型中的赌博心理行为，如过度自信和损失追逐，实验显示效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出类似赌博心理的系统性风险行为，如过度自信和概率误判，需要一种方法来减少这些行为。

Method: 提出了Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)框架，结合赌博心理学研究，通过风险校准训练和损失规避机制来调整模型行为。

Result: 实验结果显示，RARG显著减少了赌博心理行为：过度自信减少18.7%，损失追逐减少24.3%，风险校准能力提升。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了系统框架，用于理解和减少AI系统中的赌博心理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors
analogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence
bias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from
behavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these
"gambling-like" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward
outputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically
miscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)
framework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these
behavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,
and uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation
paradigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI
adaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.
Experimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like
behaviors: 18.7\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\% reduction in
loss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse
scenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for
understanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于监督扩散模型（DM）的PET图像重建方法，通过结合PET的Poisson似然模型和宽强度范围，显著提升了重建精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DM的无监督方法未能显式建模DM先验与噪声测量数据的交互，限制了重建精度。

Method: 提出监督DM算法，强制PET的Poisson似然非负性，适应PET图像的宽强度范围。

Result: 在真实脑PET体模实验中，方法在多个剂量水平上优于或匹配现有深度学习方法，并通过消融实验验证了模型组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 监督DM方法在PET重建中表现出色，支持更准确的后验采样，并可扩展至全3D PET数据。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced as a regularizing prior
for PET image reconstruction, integrating DMs trained on high-quality PET
images with unsupervised schemes that condition on measured data. While these
approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence
from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the
opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy
measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address
this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our
method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and
accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on
realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a
range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on
training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we
show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than
unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation.
Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and
present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.
