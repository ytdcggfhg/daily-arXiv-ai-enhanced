In this work, we propose\nLLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main\noutput being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system\noutputs.

We also\nintroduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300\nannotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets.

However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one.

Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small\nvolumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the\nimportance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as\nidentifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its\nanalysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited\ndatasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in\ngame-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with\ngame domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player\nbehaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention\nModel (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing\ntechnique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as \"anchors\" to help\nimprove model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach\nled to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial\nbehaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where\nlarge-scale labeled data is not available.

However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to\nadversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically\ninclude only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an\nadversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with\nlocalization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to\naddress these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties\nof pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the\nattention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and\nAL systems.

Recent methods utilizing large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are\nlimited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning\nsamples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on\nsingle-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods\nprimarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,\nthus limiting data diversity.

However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during\npre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and\ncopyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn\nundesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,\nexisting methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,\ntrapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized\nconcept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment\nerasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by\nthe cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns\nthe boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial\nrelationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional\npreprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of\nirrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the\nglobal-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic\nrelationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively\nexpanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts.

In this paper, we find a contributor\nto the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of\nprefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is\nreflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length\nTraining (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to\nmatch the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in\neach sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated\nlengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly\nconstrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and\nSimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their\nstandard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and\noverall improvements across downstream tasks.

To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to\npredict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated\nand unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D\nscene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and\npredict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder.

Progress, however, rests on the premise\nthat benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that\nthe reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system\nconfiguration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can\nintroduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is\nespecially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in\nearly tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting\naccuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a\nreasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation\nin accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences\nin GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this\nvariability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under\nlimited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic\ninvestigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM\ninference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,\nsoftware, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs\ndiverge.

More\nconcretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant\ninformation loss after being projected to the ground plane.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we\npresent a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and\nsparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a\nquery-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned\nin the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,\nwhich enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The\noutputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo\nbenchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG.

These\nerrors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as\nregression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers\nhave developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)\nand Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by\ncombining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert\nannotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under\ntheoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of\nsizes encountered in applied research.

Existing domain adaptation methods\nassume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the\nfundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to\nnegative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that\ncombines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement\n(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network\n(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning\n(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty\nDisentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module\nextracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through\nattention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while\nDCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel\npathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation\nusing Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable\nopen-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive\nrejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral\nclassification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the\ntarget domain during training.

Using neural networks trained on\nlarge-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations\nfrom sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high\nreconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D\nGaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization\nare not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for\ngenerating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward\n3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that\nsystematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce\nView-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by\nprojecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present\nVisibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy\nby aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis\ntransformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an\noff-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression\nfor 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods.

In this paper, we evaluate\nthe human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18\ninstruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice\ntest items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our\nmethodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are\ncommonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item\nresponse theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively\nconfident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated\nwith temperature scaling.

The key\nchallenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric\ncues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images\nand 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D\ngeometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on\npredicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to\nlearn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly\nthrough the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D\nawareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,\nthe truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision\nfrom 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D\ngeometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end\ntraining.

Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system.

In this\npaper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image\nand a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we\nextract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using\na VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining\nmatches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the\nindividual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder\nVLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL\ncompositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the\nperformance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential\nof inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for\nattribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an\nextensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually\nessential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific\nareas to further improve inference-time approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5e76\u5339\u914d\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668VLM\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u5339\u914d\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,\noverlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically\ninconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme\nnamed Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates\ncontext-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,\nensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of\npre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an\nadversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing\nmodel misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This\ncomprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective\nadversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns.

A key\nchallenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen\nduring training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training\non synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial\ncomputational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for\naccurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we\nintroduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method\nthat achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric\nand vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves\nboth accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a\nsparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation\nwithout sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that\nimproves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final\nranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles\nof instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks\nerrors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,\nwhere it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen\nobjects.

Designing proteins that bind\nto a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and\nchemistry.

Their analysis has attracted considerable\ninterest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,\ncriminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME\nresearch is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional\ninformation conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME\nrecognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.\nTherefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual\nfeatures and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion\nframework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study\nintroduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables\nsynchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system\nsignals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming\nthe constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841\nmacro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,\nestablishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and\nconducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the\ndataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating\nthat integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting\nperformance.

This task remains fundamentally\nchallenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and\nambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D\nknowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding\nexplicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and\nground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts\nhave sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera\nposes of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and\nthe necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:\nthe performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as\ndata scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D\nknowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of\nreducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated\nby and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D\ninductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By\neliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and\nlearns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D\ninductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel\nviews, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed\ninputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our\ndata-centric paradigm.

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source.

Only-Style works by localizing content\nleakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that\ncontrols the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches\ncontaining the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best\nbalances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the\nlocalization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a\nreference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any\nmethod-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the\nstylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to\nquantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired\ncontent leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over\nstate-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,\nconsistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content\nleakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faOnly-Style\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Only-Style\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Only-Style\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,\ntext-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted\npurely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal\ninput. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in\nspatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and\ncontinuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental\nvisualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing\nto reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through\nelementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards.

However,\nmost existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions\nin a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in\nthe same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object\ninteractions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control\nof multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders\napplications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and\nintroduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of\nconditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint.

AI-based perception outputs are inherently\nstochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while\ntraditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to\ncapture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the\nPerception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that\nquantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,\nincorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the\nSensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a\nsensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear\nand daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target\nobjects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the\nvariance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD\nvalues across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic\nthresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall\nperception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.\nApplying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful\nreliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that\nstatic metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure\nof perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,\nwhile the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.\nThe SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the\nevaluation code is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/datadrivenwheels/PCD_Python.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPCD\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86SensorRainFall\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5929\u6c14\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPCD\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SensorRainFall\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u70b9\u3002", "result": "PCD\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "PCD\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSensorRainFall\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist\nmalicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP),\nwhich is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety\nPrompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It\npreserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we\npropose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt\nthrough supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent\nability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than\nprior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative\nLVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while\npreserving benign input utility.

However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's\ngeneralist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code\nto serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on\nclosing the perception-to-action gap.

This paper explores a self-supervised approach\nthat combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data\n(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,\nand planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free\njoint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset\ncomprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong\nperformance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something\nv2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7\nrecall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.\nAdditionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering\ntasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on\nTempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to\nrobotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world\nmodel, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the\nDroid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different\nlabs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.\nNotably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these\nenvironments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work\ndemonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small\namount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in\nthe physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u89e3\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784V-JEPA 2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\uff0877.3 top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff0884.0 PerceptionTest\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u89c4\u5212\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional approaches that\npredict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by\nexplicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single\nautoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe\naction that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens\nare generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and\npreviously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a\nglobal-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained\nby the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA\nincorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token\nrepresentation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;\nreverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk\nmodeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial\ngeneralization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of\na visuo-motor policy.

Feed-forward scene\nreconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly\ncreate digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples.
