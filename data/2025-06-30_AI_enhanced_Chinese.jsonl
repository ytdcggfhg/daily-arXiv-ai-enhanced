With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret\nunseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in\nthe prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).\nAnother subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model\nperformance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs\nhas effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to\nlong context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for\ninstruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this\nend, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can\nefficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled\nexamples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference\nspeed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its\nmodel backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and\ninference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network\n(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the\nrepresentation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented\nas a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model\nparameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture\ngeneral knowledge.

However, these models still struggle with\npanoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels\nof geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To\naddress these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we\nintroduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating\ngrids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\\circ$ view.

Furthermore, we propose a\nmodel-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global\ncoherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image\nquality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and\nprovide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and\nstandardized evaluation scripts.

Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOCUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MLLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u5728MLLMs\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FOCUS\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56fe\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u533a\u57df\u6267\u884cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "FOCUS\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u79cdMLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c113-6.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FOCUS\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces\nseveral key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention\nbetween masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a\npoint cloud adaptation of multi-crop.

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly\nfocus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,\nobjects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.\nIn contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and\nnarrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately\nomit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and\nrelationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs\nderived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized\ninto key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth\nand proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and\nmotivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred\ncounting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors\nensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models\nreveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level\nvisual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning.

Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of\ncognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce\nCogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.\nCogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,\nand employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit\nidentification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nwidely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that\nLRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also\nadaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses\nfurther uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit\nprofiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and\nDeepSeek-R1).

However, their\napplication to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant\ndomain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately.

For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating\nopinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling\nviews on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income\nand non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant\ndifferences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the\nfree market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to\novergeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting\nto consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to\nmitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,\ncalling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepSeek-V3\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u89c1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u53ca\u4eba\u53e3\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578bDeepSeek\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83DeepSeek-R1\u3001DeepSeek-V3\u4e0eQwen2.5\u3001GPT-4o\u3001Llama-3.3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ANES\u548c\u4e2d\u56fd\u4f50\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7f8e\u793e\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\u610f\u89c1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "DeepSeek-V3\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5815\u80ce\u8bae\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5728\u5916\u63f4\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bae\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u8bae\u9898\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6982\u62ec\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u5728\u516c\u4f17\u610f\u89c1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

However, current methods neglect the influence of human\nattributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors\nshaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for\nbridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute\ninformation and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively\nwith action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural\nCausal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,\nenabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation.

Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant\nprogress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but\nstruggle with long-horizon robotic tasks.

However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving\none task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,\nleading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need\nfor autoregressive generation.

Continuous maritime\nship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,\nlaw enforcement, and shipping analysis.

Extensive comparative and ablation experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,\nvalidating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed\nframework.

In contrast, machine\nintelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically\nrefine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored\nreasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such\nas mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step\nreasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,\nspatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,\nwhich remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that\nenables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with\nincreasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where\nlabelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human\ncognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I\nmodule for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that\niteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech\ngeneration with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.\nExperimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,\nand emotional fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "IndexTTS2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52TTS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u65f6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u97f3\u8272\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52TTS\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u65f6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u4e0e\u97f3\u8272\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u914d\u97f3\u7b49\u4e25\u683c\u97f3\u753b\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u5b9a\u751f\u6210token\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u957f\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u97f5\u5f8b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7ed3\u5408GPT\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8f6f\u6307\u4ee4\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cIndexTTS2\u5728\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3001\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684TTS\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "IndexTTS2\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52TTS\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65f6\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u89e3\u8026\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view\nin single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is\nrequired by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we\npropose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two\nstages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating\nboth the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the\ndissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and\nobserved intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view\ntraining loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly\nenforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is\nperformed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method\nexploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the\nrobustness of the registration process.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of\nlanguage change contribute to our understanding of how language technology\ncontinues to shape human language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8bcd\u6c47\u9891\u7387\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\uff09\u5bf9\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u591a\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u5c42\u9762\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u79d1\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u9891\u7387\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bcd\u6c47\uff08\u5982'delve'\u3001'intricate'\u3001'crucial'\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u4f46\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u662f\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\u8fd8\u662f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790PubMed\u79d1\u5b66\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u7ec4\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u6fc0\u589e\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u96c6\u7fa4\u6574\u4f53\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u3002\u5f62\u5bb9\u8bcd'important'\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6fc0\u589e\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u7528\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb\nnumber agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic\nstructures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing\nfor integrating global syntactic information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDerivational Probing\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76BERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fae\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\u5e76\u9010\u6e10\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u95f4\u6784\u5efa\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5fae\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Derivational Probing\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790BERT\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5fae\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5fae\u89c2\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u6574\u5408\u4e3a\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u673a\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u9075\u5faa\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6574\u5408\u65f6\u673a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a\nconstraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts\nhigh-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a\nstructured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.\nIt then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture\narrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a\nheuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.\nTo handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint\nrepresentation that processes both formal specifications and natural language\ninputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a\ncomprehensive action space design.

In this paper, we define two\ntypes of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and\ninference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase\nevaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single\nverifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across\ndifferent query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically\nsensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or\nideologically aligned perspectives.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based\nreinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two\naugmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.\nDuring training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to\ncompare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the\nmodel with rule-based reinforcement learning.

Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,\nincluding variations in language complexity between individuals and\norganizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and\nbetween those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.\nAdditionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to\nuse more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and\nreliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new\ninsights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute\nto a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social\nstructures in online spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Twitter\u4e0a\u5173\u4e8eCOVID-19\u3001COP26\u548c\u4fc4\u4e4c\u6218\u4e89\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bdd\u9898\u7684\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u8d26\u6237\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u8bdd\u8bed\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u8d26\u6237\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u7528\u6237\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u540c\u7684\u884c\u8bdd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u6620\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks.

The TUS-REC2024\nChallenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless\n3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the\nfirst time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge\nattracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid\ndockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic\napproaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,\nattention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the\nChallenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a\nconcise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying\nmethodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a\ncomparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.\nThe results highlight both the progress and current limitations of\nstate-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future\nresearch.

However, current approaches require a large number of\ndenoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme\nbitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression\nscenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,\nas diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step\ndiffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with\nimproved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an\nefficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent\nrepresentation for a single-step denoising process.

Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve\nthe generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse\nCT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)\nreconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT\nimage noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior\ninformation from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a\nnoise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed\nNEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.\nFirst, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection\ndata, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT\nprojections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine\nreconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions\nto more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction\nfidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain\nreconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be\neffectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time\nstep matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and\nsegmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and\ngeneralization performance.

In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which\nintegrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To\nbetter understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG\nleverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that\nsummarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural\nLanguage Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between\ncandidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent\nthat summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that\ngenerates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate\nARAG accross three datasets.

These models often struggle to construct stable\nframe-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis\nquality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications.

DCAR\nintroduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with\nmulti-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech\ncontexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts\nthe token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length\ndependency while obtaining high synthesis quality.

A common clinical approach mitigates this by\nsorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per\nphase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT\ninstead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion\nwithout phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)\noffer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to\ndynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,\nuse implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis\nfunction and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by\ncoupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and\nrotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six\nCBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over\nHexPlane.

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average.

To measure the effectiveness of our proposed\nmetric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a\nsubset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender\nbias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.\nOur extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our\nproposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to\nprevious metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for\nGrep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa\nagreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating\nLLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias\nannotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust\nframework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CWEx\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6MSMGenderBias\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5CWEx\uff0c\u5e76\u5728MS MARCO Passage Ranking\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "CWEx\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08Cohen's Kappa\u5206\u522b\u4e3a58.77%\u548c18.51%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
