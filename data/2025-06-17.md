### [1] [Focusing on Students, not Machines: Grounded Question Generation and Automated Answer Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12066)
*Gérôme Meyer,Philip Breuer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于课程材料生成问题并自动评分学生答案的系统，改进了PDF文档的分块方法，并展示了LLMs在自动评分任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻教师和学生的工作负担，解决开放式问题生成和评分繁琐的问题。

Method: 采用视觉布局分块PDF文档，结合RAG技术生成问题和参考答案，并利用LLMs进行自动评分。

Result: 验证了高质量问题和答案的生成可行性，LLMs在自动评分任务中表现良好，且参数规模越大性能越优。

Conclusion: 当前系统仍需人工监督，尤其在考试场景中，但为自动评分系统提供了新基准和方向。

Abstract: Digital technologies are increasingly used in education to reduce the
workload of teachers and students. However, creating open-ended study or
examination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This
thesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded
in class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a
sophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically
targeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks,
including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that
high-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study
material. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short
answers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of
various grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models
(LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from
their pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of
the LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need
human oversight, especially in examination scenarios.

### [2] [ChatbotManip: A Dataset to Facilitate Evaluation and Oversight of Manipulative Chatbot Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12090)
*Jack Contro,Simrat Deol,Yulan He,Martim Brandão*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatbotManip数据集研究聊天机器人操纵行为，揭示LLM在明确指令下易操纵，小模型检测操纵性能接近大模型但不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究聊天机器人操纵行为，为AI安全提供洞察，应对LLM在消费应用中的操纵风险。

Method: 构建ChatbotManip数据集，模拟聊天机器人操纵对话，人工标注操纵行为，分析LLM操纵表现。

Result: 84%的明确指令对话被标注为操纵；LLM默认使用争议性策略；小模型检测性能接近大模型但不可靠。

Conclusion: 需关注LLM操纵风险，小模型检测尚不成熟，对AI安全研究有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces ChatbotManip, a novel dataset for studying manipulation
in Chatbots. It contains simulated generated conversations between a chatbot
and a (simulated) user, where the chatbot is explicitly asked to showcase
manipulation tactics, persuade the user towards some goal, or simply be
helpful. We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from
consumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition
argumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both
general manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals
three key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative
when explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in
approximately 84\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to
be ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently
default to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and
fear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as
BERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with
larger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet
reliable for real-world oversight. Our work provides important insights for AI
safety research and highlights the need of addressing manipulation risks as
LLMs are increasingly deployed in consumer-facing applications.

### [3] [Continuously Updating Digital Twins using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12091)
*Harry Amad,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM-DT是一种基于上下文学习的数字孪生模型，利用大型语言模型实现动态更新，无需重新设计或训练即可适应环境变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字孪生方法无法动态适应状态和变量的变化，需要固定建模环境，限制了其灵活性。

Method: 提出CALM-DT，通过上下文学习和微调编码器实现样本检索，支持动态更新。

Result: CALM-DT在性能上与现有方法相当，且能无需参数更新即可适应环境变化。

Conclusion: CALM-DT为数字孪生提供了一种灵活、自适应的解决方案，适用于动态复杂环境。

Abstract: Digital twins are models of real-world systems that can simulate their
dynamics in response to potential actions. In complex settings, the state and
action variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can
constantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these
changes to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they
require fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to
novel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without
re-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context
learning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the
twin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language
Model-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse
state-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned
encoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive
performance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to
adapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates.

### [4] [Enhancing Traffic Accident Classifications: Application of NLP Methods for City Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12092)
*Enes Özeren,Alexander Ulbrich,Sascha Filimon,David Rügamer,Andreas Bender*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析慕尼黑的交通事故数据，结合结构化和非结构化数据，利用NLP方法发现标签不一致性，并开发了高精度的分类模型，证明文本数据在事故分类中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升城市安全并为政策决策提供依据，通过分析交通事故模式及其特征。

Method: 结合结构化数据（如地点、时间、天气）和非结构化文本数据，应用NLP方法（主题建模和小样本学习）评估标签可靠性，并开发分类模型。

Result: 文本数据对分类最具信息量，结构化数据改进有限；模型分类准确率高。

Conclusion: 文本数据在事故分析中至关重要，基于Transformer的模型可提升分类可靠性。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents is essential for improving
city safety and informing policy decisions. In this study, we analyze traffic
incidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish
different types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular
features, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as
unstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each
accident. Each incident is categorized into one of seven predefined classes. To
assess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic
modeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling
process. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident
classification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these
insights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in
assigning accidents to their respective categories. Our results demonstrate
that textual descriptions contain the most informative features for
classification, while the inclusion of tabular data provides only marginal
improvements. These findings emphasize the critical role of free-text data in
accident analysis and highlight the potential of transformer-based models in
improving classification reliability.

### [5] [UCD: Unlearning in LLMs via Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12097)
*Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Ayush Sekhari,Ashia Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比解码的推理时间遗忘算法，通过辅助模型指导原始模型输出，显著提升了遗忘效果与模型性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从大语言模型中移除特定信息（如敏感内容）的需求，同时保持模型整体性能。

Method: 使用对比解码，结合两个辅助小模型（一个未训练遗忘集，一个训练过遗忘集），在推理时引导原始模型输出。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，遗忘质量和保留性能均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 对比解码为大规模模型的概念遗忘提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific information, e.g. sensitive or
undesirable content, from large language models (LLMs) while preserving overall
performance. We propose an inference-time unlearning algorithm that uses
contrastive decoding, leveraging two auxiliary smaller models, one trained
without the forget set and one trained with it, to guide the outputs of the
original model using their difference during inference. Our strategy
substantially improves the tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness and model
utility. We evaluate our approach on two unlearning benchmarks, TOFU and MUSE.
Results show notable gains in both forget quality and retained performance in
comparison to prior approaches, suggesting that incorporating contrastive
decoding can offer an efficient, practical avenue for unlearning concepts in
large-scale models.

### [6] [Personalized LLM Decoding via Contrasting Personal Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12109)
*Hyungjune Bu,Chanjoo Jung,Minjae Kang,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的解码时方法CoPe，通过对比个人偏好优化用户个性化生成任务，无需额外训练或外部奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的广泛部署，个性化需求日益增长，但解码时算法的开发尚未充分探索。

Method: CoPe在参数高效微调后，利用奖励引导解码，最大化用户的隐式奖励信号。

Result: 在五个开放式个性化文本生成任务中，CoPe平均提升10.57%的ROUGE-L分数。

Conclusion: CoPe是一种高效且无需额外资源的个性化解码方法，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various
real-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly
important. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based
and training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of
effective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their
demonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal
Preference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is
to leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by
maximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five
open-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results
demonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by
an average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or
additional training procedures.

### [7] [Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12115)
*Brown Ebouky,Andrea Bartezzaghi,Mattia Rigotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过认知工具增强LLM推理能力的方法，并展示了其在数学推理任务中的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索替代方法以揭示LLM推理的潜在机制，并提供可能具有互补效益的额外方法。

Method: 基于认知心理学和认知架构的文献，提出了一种通过赋予LLM一组封装特定推理操作的“认知工具”来增强推理能力的方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在标准数学推理基准上显著提升了性能，例如GPT-4.1的AIME2024 pass@1从26.7%提升至43.3%。

Conclusion: 研究不仅具有实际意义，还为LLM推理能力的来源（预训练还是后训练方法）提供了新的讨论视角。

Abstract: The recent advent of reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 was met with excited
speculation by the AI community about the mechanisms underlying these
capabilities in closed models, followed by a rush of replication efforts,
particularly from the open source community. These speculations were largely
settled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and
reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base
LLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for
theoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying
mechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer
complementary benefits.
  Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and
cognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the
orchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive
operations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic
tool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of
"cognitive tools" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by
the LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable
gains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to
base LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our
"cognitive tools" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.
  In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to
the debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning
in LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training,
and whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.

### [8] [Unsupervised Document and Template Clustering using Multimodal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12116)
*Phillipe R. Sampaio,Helene Maxcici*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用多模态嵌入作为传统聚类算法输入的无监督文档聚类新方法，旨在通过捕捉文档的文本、布局和视觉特征实现更细粒度的文档分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档聚类方法通常仅基于文本内容，难以区分同一类别中的不同模板。本文希望通过多模态嵌入提升聚类效果。

Method: 使用多种先进的多模态预训练模型（如SBERT、LayoutLMv1等）生成嵌入，并将其输入k-Means和DBSCAN等传统聚类算法。

Result: 实验表明，多模态嵌入能显著提升文档聚类效果，适用于智能文档处理、布局分析等应用。

Conclusion: 本文验证了多模态嵌入在文档聚类中的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向，并分析了不同模型的优缺点。

Abstract: This paper investigates a novel approach to unsupervised document clustering
by leveraging multimodal embeddings as input to traditional clustering
algorithms such as $k$-Means and DBSCAN. Our method aims to achieve a
finer-grained document understanding by not only grouping documents at the type
level (e.g., invoices, purchase orders), but also distinguishing between
different templates within the same document category. This is achieved by
using embeddings that capture textual content, layout information, and visual
features of documents. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using
embeddings generated by several state-of-the-art pretrained multimodal models,
including SBERT, LayoutLMv1, LayoutLMv3, DiT, Donut, and ColPali. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of multimodal embeddings to significantly enhance
document clustering, offering benefits for various applications in intelligent
document processing, document layout analysis, and unsupervised document
classification. This work provides valuable insight into the advantages and
limitations of different multimodal models for this task and opens new avenues
for future research to understand and organize document collections.

*Houyi Li,Ka Man Lo,Ziqi Wang,Zili Wang,Wenzhen Zheng,Shuigeng Zhou,Xiangyu Zhang,Daxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoE语言模型在相同资源约束下能否超越密集架构？研究发现，在最优激活率下，MoE模型可以超越密集模型，且这一结论在不同规模模型中一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE语言模型在严格相同资源（参数、计算、数据）约束下是否能超越密集架构，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出新视角和方法框架，优化MoE设计，并通过实验验证（训练200个2B模型和50个7B模型）。

Result: 在最优激活率下，MoE模型性能优于密集模型，且结论在不同规模中一致；数据量增加可通过数据重用解决。

Conclusion: MoE模型在资源约束下具有优势，最优激活率是关键，数据重用可解决性能提升的代价。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models dramatically expand model capacity
and achieve remarkable performance without increasing per-token compute.
However, can MoEs surpass dense architectures under strictly equal resource
constraints - that is, when the total parameter count, training compute, and
data budget are identical? This question remains under-explored despite its
significant practical value and potential. In this paper, we propose a novel
perspective and methodological framework to study this question thoroughly.
First, we comprehensively investigate the architecture of MoEs and achieve an
optimal model design that maximizes the performance. Based on this, we
subsequently find that an MoE model with activation rate in an optimal region
is able to outperform its dense counterpart under the same total parameter,
training compute and data resource. More importantly, this optimal region
remains consistent across different model sizes. Although additional amount of
data turns out to be a trade-off for the enhanced performance, we show that
this can be resolved via reusing data. We validate our findings through
extensive experiments, training nearly 200 language models at 2B scale and over
50 at 7B scale, cumulatively processing 50 trillion tokens. All models will be
released publicly.

*Chiara Di Bonaventura,Barbara McGillivray,Yulan He,Albert Meroño-Peñuela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言随时间变化对仇恨言论模型评估的影响，发现静态评估与时间敏感评估之间存在偏差，呼吁采用时间敏感的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论领域语言快速演变，但现有研究多关注模型训练，对模型评估的影响研究不足。

Method: 通过两个动态仇恨言论实验，评估了20种语言模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现静态评估与时间敏感评估之间存在时间偏差。

Conclusion: 建议采用时间敏感的基准来更准确可靠地评估仇恨言论领域的语言模型。

Abstract: Language changes over time, including in the hate speech domain, which
evolves quickly following social dynamics and cultural shifts. While NLP
research has investigated the impact of language evolution on model training
and has proposed several solutions for it, its impact on model benchmarking
remains under-explored. Yet, hate speech benchmarks play a crucial role to
ensure model safety. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the robustness of
20 language models across two evolving hate speech experiments, and we show the
temporal misalignment between static and time-sensitive evaluations. Our
findings call for time-sensitive linguistic benchmarks in order to correctly
and reliably evaluate language models in the hate speech domain.

*Evan Becker,Benjamin Bowman,Matthew Trager,Tian Yu Liu,Luca Zancato,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RICO的检索方法，利用LLM的梯度优化文档选择，以最小化模型不确定性，优于传统检索增强生成（RAG）和微调检索器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM在推理时无法利用所有可用信息，且受限于模型资源，需依赖外部存储。如何基于查询和模型选择相关数据成为关键问题。

Method: RICO通过LLM的梯度学习最优文档组合，无需微调，仅最小化问题困惑度。理论证明标准top-k检索可近似优化过程。

Result: 实验表明，RICO在无微调情况下性能与BM25相当，且在最终预测质量上常优于微调检索器如E5。

Conclusion: RICO通过直接反馈优化检索，显著提升推理性能，为检索增强生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Given a query and dataset, the optimal way of answering the query is to make
use all the information available. Modern LLMs exhibit impressive ability to
memorize training data, but data not deemed important during training is
forgotten, and information outside that training set cannot be made use of.
Processing an entire dataset at inference time is infeasible due to the bounded
nature of model resources (e.g. context size in transformers or states in state
space models), meaning we must resort to external memory. This constraint
naturally leads to the following problem: How can we decide based on the
present query and model, what among a virtually unbounded set of known data
matters for inference? To minimize model uncertainty for a particular query at
test-time, we introduce Retrieval In-Context Optimization (RICO), a retrieval
method that uses gradients from the LLM itself to learn the optimal mixture of
documents for answer generation. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), which relies on external heuristics for document retrieval,
our approach leverages direct feedback from the model. Theoretically, we show
that standard top-$k$ retrieval with model gradients can approximate our
optimization procedure, and provide connections to the leave-one-out loss. We
demonstrate empirically that by minimizing an unsupervised loss objective in
the form of question perplexity, we can achieve comparable retriever metric
performance to BM25 with \emph{no finetuning}. Furthermore, when evaluated on
quality of the final prediction, our method often outperforms fine-tuned dense
retrievers such as E5.

### [12] [A Rigorous Evaluation of LLM Data Generation Strategies for Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12158)
*Tatiana Ankinina,Jan Cegin,Jakub Simko,Simon Ostermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了多种生成策略在低资源语言环境下生成合成文本的效果，发现目标语言示例与LLM修订的组合表现最佳，缩小了与真实数据的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏对低资源语言环境下不同生成策略的比较研究，尤其是提示策略的效果尚不明确。

Method: 在11种语言上评估多种生成策略及其组合，使用三个NLP任务和四个开源LLM，比较生成数据与真实数据的下游模型性能。

Result: 目标语言示例与LLM修订的组合表现最优，差距缩小至5%；智能提示技术可减少大模型的优势。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言环境下，合理组合生成策略可高效生成合成数据，缩小与真实数据的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic
textual data for training smaller specialized models. However, a comparison of
various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking.
While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations,
label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness
remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and
their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several
extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs,
we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data.
Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods,
particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield
strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some
settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage
of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data
generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.

*Chenqian Le,Ziheng Gong,Chihang Wang,Haowei Ni,Panfeng Li,Xupeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了提示设计和轻量级微调对开源大语言模型在生物医学问答任务中的表现影响，发现思维链提示在零样本设置中有效，而指令微调显著提升准确性，但效果因模型和规模而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应大语言模型到生物医学推理领域具有挑战性，因领域复杂性和有限监督，研究旨在探索提示设计和微调策略的效果。

Method: 采用标准指令提示和思维链提示策略，并使用QLoRA进行参数高效的指令微调，在PubMedQA基准上测试不同模型家族和规模。

Result: 思维链提示在零样本设置中提升推理能力，指令微调显著提高准确性，但对某些大模型微调思维链提示可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 提示工程与高效微调结合对医学问答应用具有实用价值，但效果依赖模型和规模。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in medical question
answering (MedQA), yet adapting them to biomedical reasoning remains
challenging due to domain-specific complexity and limited supervision. In this
work, we study how prompt design and lightweight fine-tuning affect the
performance of open-source LLMs on PubMedQA, a benchmark for multiple-choice
biomedical questions. We focus on two widely used prompting strategies -
standard instruction prompts and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts - and apply
QLoRA for parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Across multiple model
families and sizes, our experiments show that CoT prompting alone can improve
reasoning in zero-shot settings, while instruction tuning significantly boosts
accuracy. However, fine-tuning on CoT prompts does not universally enhance
performance and may even degrade it for certain larger models. These findings
suggest that reasoning-aware prompts are useful, but their benefits are model-
and scale-dependent. Our study offers practical insights into combining prompt
engineering with efficient finetuning for medical QA applications.

### [14] [Supernova Event Dataset: Interpreting Large Language Model's Personality through Critical Event Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12189)
*Pranav Agarwal,Ioana Ciucă*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过Supernova Event Dataset评估LLMs提取和排序关键事件的能力，揭示不同模型的个性特征，提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在日常应用中的普及，理解其决策和个性特征变得至关重要。

Method: 使用Supernova Event Dataset评估多种LLMs，并设计框架让另一LLM作为评委推断模型个性。

Result: 不同模型展现出独特个性，如Orca 2侧重情感推理，Qwen 2.5更偏重战略分析。

Conclusion: 分析提升了模型的可解释性，使其更适用于多样化应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and
underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model
personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with
diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific
discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking
key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires
reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small
models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as
Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another
LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection
and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:
for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal
dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When
analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual
framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors
step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability,
making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications.

*Hao Xu,Jiacheng Liu,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith,Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infini-gram mini 是一种高效、可扩展的系统，用于搜索 PB 级文本数据，基于 FM-index 数据结构，显著提升了索引速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解互联网大规模文本数据对语言模型训练的重要性，以及现有搜索系统在存储和效率上的不足。

Method: 基于 FM-index 数据结构，设计 Infini-gram mini 系统，优化索引和压缩文本，显著减少存储和内存占用。

Result: 索引 46TB 互联网文本仅需 50 天（单节点）或 19 小时（75 节点），并发现多个核心语言模型评估基准被污染。

Conclusion: Infini-gram mini 为大规模文本搜索提供了高效解决方案，并揭示了基准污染问题，需警惕其对语言模型评估的影响。

Abstract: Language models are trained mainly on massive text data from the Internet,
and it becomes increasingly important to understand this data source.
Exact-match search engines enable searching in large text corpora -- counting
string appearances and retrieving the enclosing documents -- yet the high
storage overhead hinders their application on Internet-scale data. We present
Infini-gram mini, an efficient and scalable system that can make petabyte-level
text corpora searchable. Based on the FM-index data structure (Ferragina and
Manzini, 2000), which simultaneously indexes and compresses text, our system
creates indexes with size only 44% of the corpus. Infini-gram mini greatly
improves upon the best existing implementation of FM-index in terms of indexing
speed (18$\times$) and memory use during both indexing (3.2$\times$ reduction)
and querying (down to a negligible amount). We index 46TB of Internet text in
50 days with a single 128-core CPU node (or 19 hours if using 75 such nodes).
We show one important use case of Infini-gram mini in a large-scale analysis of
benchmark contamination. We find several core LM evaluation benchmarks to be
heavily contaminated in Internet crawls (up to 40% in SQuAD), which could lead
to overestimating the capabilities of language models if trained on such data.
We host a benchmark contamination bulletin to share the contamination rate of
many core and community-contributed benchmarks. We also release a web interface
and an API endpoint to serve general search queries on Infini-gram mini
indexes.

*Arno Simons,Michael Zichert,Adrian Wüthrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学史、哲学和社会学（HPSS）研究中的应用，分析了其机遇与挑战，并提出了整合LLMs的四点建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPSS领域强调解释性方法，而LLMs在非结构化文本处理和上下文推理方面表现出色，这为HPSS提供了新的研究工具，同时也需要审视其认知假设和基础设施影响。

Method: 文章首先为非技术读者介绍了LLM架构和训练范式，将其视为编码认知假设的基础设施，随后探讨了LLMs支持的多种计算技术在HPSS中的应用，并比较了不同模型的优缺点。

Result: 分析表明，LLMs可以支持HPSS的解释性研究，但需要权衡模型选择、提升LLM素养、定义领域基准，并确保LLMs补充而非替代传统方法。

Conclusion: 整合LLMs到HPSS需要平衡技术与解释性需求，强调LLMs应作为辅助工具，而非取代传统研究方法。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools
in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). LLMs are
remarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from
context, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between
computational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and
challenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and
understands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated.
We argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs'
capabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and
infrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on
LLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We
frame LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode
assumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their
training data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how
computational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting
patterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support
interpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and
generative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g.,
continued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and
evaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry
in HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1)
model selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is
foundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs
should enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.

### [17] [The Behavior Gap: Evaluating Zero-shot LLM Agents in Complex Task-Oriented Dialogs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12266)
*Avinash Baidya,Kamalika Das,Xiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估框架，量化了LLM代理与人类专家在任务导向对话系统中的行为差距，发现行为差距是影响性能的关键因素。随着任务复杂度增加，行为差距扩大，导致性能下降。减少行为差距可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM代理在零样本场景下性能不佳的原因，探索行为差距对任务导向对话系统的影响。

Method: 提出一个综合评估框架，量化LLM代理与人类专家在对话行为、工具使用和知识利用上的差异。

Result: 行为差距与任务复杂度高度相关（0.963），复杂任务中行为差距显著，导致性能下降。减少行为差距可平均提升性能24.3%。

Conclusion: 强调行为评估和提升对齐策略的重要性，以增强LLM代理在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have significantly impacted
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (TODS) but continue to face notable performance
challenges, especially in zero-shot scenarios. While prior work has noted this
performance gap, the behavioral factors driving the performance gap remain
under-explored. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework to
quantify the behavior gap between AI agents and human experts, focusing on
discrepancies in dialog acts, tool usage, and knowledge utilization. Our
findings reveal that this behavior gap is a critical factor negatively
impacting the performance of LLM agents. Notably, as task complexity increases,
the behavior gap widens (correlation: 0.963), leading to a degradation of agent
performance on complex task-oriented dialogs. For the most complex task in our
study, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior,
with low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool
usage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge.
Reducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3%
on average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral
evaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of
LLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏统一的医学QA框架，且现有大型语言模型在医学理解方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: Med-U1采用纯大规模强化学习，结合混合规则二元奖励函数和长度惩罚，优化多目标奖励以生成简洁可验证的推理链。

Result: Med-U1在多个医学QA基准测试中表现优异，超越专业和专有模型，并展现出对OOD任务的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Med-U1为医学LLMs提供了有效的训练策略和奖励设计，代码将开源。

Abstract: Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks,
including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and
complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for
delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress
in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their
ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely
unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust
reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from
MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure
large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward
functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With
multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and
verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly
improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing
even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1
demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.
Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain
length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代希伯来语的正字法复杂性导致现有TTS解决方案无法准确捕捉关键语音特征（如重音），Phonikud旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过轻量级适配器改进现有注音模型，生成完全指定的IPA转录，并贡献了带IPA标注的希伯来语语音数据集ILSpeech。

Result: Phonikud在音素预测准确性上优于现有方法，支持训练出速度与准确性更优的实时希伯来语TTS模型。

Conclusion: Phonikud为希伯来语TTS提供了高效的开源解决方案，代码、数据和模型已公开。

Abstract: Real-time text-to-speech (TTS) for Modern Hebrew is challenging due to the
language's orthographic complexity. Existing solutions ignore crucial phonetic
features such as stress that remain underspecified even when vowel marks are
added. To address these limitations, we introduce Phonikud, a lightweight,
open-source Hebrew grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) system that outputs
fully-specified IPA transcriptions. Our approach adapts an existing
diacritization model with lightweight adaptors, incurring negligible additional
latency. We also contribute the ILSpeech dataset of transcribed Hebrew speech
with IPA annotations, serving as a benchmark for Hebrew G2P and as training
data for TTS systems. Our results demonstrate that Phonikud G2P conversion more
accurately predicts phonemes from Hebrew text compared to prior methods, and
that this enables training of effective real-time Hebrew TTS models with
superior speed-accuracy trade-offs. We release our code, data, and models at
https://phonikud.github.io.

TL;DR: 研究构建了日本基准inter-JBBQ，用于评估大语言模型在问答设置中的交叉偏见，发现GPT-4o和Swallow的偏见输出随上下文变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一社会属性的偏见，而社会科学表明偏见常以交叉性形式出现，因此需要评估LLMs的交叉偏见。

Method: 构建日本基准inter-JBBQ，用于分析GPT-4o和Swallow在问答中的交叉偏见。

Result: 发现即使社会属性组合相同，偏见输出也会因上下文不同而变化。

Conclusion: 交叉偏见在LLMs中具有上下文依赖性，需进一步研究以改进模型公平性。

Abstract: An growing number of studies have examined the social bias of rapidly
developed large language models (LLMs). Although most of these studies have
focused on bias occurring in a single social attribute, research in social
science has shown that social bias often occurs in the form of
intersectionality -- the constitutive and contextualized perspective on bias
aroused by social attributes. In this study, we construct the Japanese
benchmark inter-JBBQ, designed to evaluate the intersectional bias in LLMs on
the question-answering setting. Using inter-JBBQ to analyze GPT-4o and Swallow,
we find that biased output varies according to its contexts even with the equal
combination of social attributes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知偏见（如确认偏见和可用性偏见）可能通过提示扭曲用户输入，导致LLM产生不忠实和误导性的输出，因此需要研究其影响。

Method: 通过系统性框架，在提示中引入多种认知偏见，并在多个基准数据集（包括通用和金融问答场景）中评估其对LLM准确性的影响。

Result: 结果表明，即使是细微的偏见也会显著改变LLM的回答选择，注意力权重分析揭示了偏见如何影响LLM内部决策过程。

Conclusion: 研究强调了偏见感知提示设计的重要性，对AI开发者和用户提升AI应用在多样化领域中的鲁棒性和可靠性具有启示意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of cognitive biases on Large Language
Models (LLMs) outputs. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation and availability
biases, can distort user inputs through prompts, potentially leading to
unfaithful and misleading outputs from LLMs. Using a systematic framework, our
study introduces various cognitive biases into prompts and assesses their
impact on LLM accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets, including general
and financial Q&A scenarios. The results demonstrate that even subtle biases
can significantly alter LLM answer choices, highlighting a critical need for
bias-aware prompt design and mitigation strategy. Additionally, our attention
weight analysis highlights how these biases can alter the internal
decision-making processes of LLMs, affecting the attention distribution in ways
that are associated with output inaccuracies. This research has implications
for Al developers and users in enhancing the robustness and reliability of Al
applications in diverse domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在长上下文大语言模型（LLM）中使用大量演示样本时，传统ICL选择策略的有效性，并提出了一种新算法Refract ICL以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM的出现使得使用数百甚至数千个演示样本进行上下文学习（ICL）成为可能，但传统ICL选择策略在此情况下是否仍然有效尚不明确。

Method: 通过实验验证传统ICL策略的局限性，并提出Refract ICL算法，通过重复挑战性样本和利用零样本预测作为错误信号来优化ICL选择。

Result: 实验表明，单纯增加演示样本数量并不能保证性能提升，而Refract ICL显著提升了长上下文模型（如Gemini 1.5 Pro）的性能，尤其是在输出类别较少的任务上。

Conclusion: 即使在大量演示样本的情况下，智能ICL选择仍然至关重要，Refract ICL为长上下文LLM的ICL提供了有效的改进方案。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) has enabled the
use of hundreds, or even thousands, of demonstrations for in-context learning
(ICL) - a previously impractical regime. This paper investigates whether
traditional ICL selection strategies, which balance the similarity of ICL
examples to the test input (using a text retriever) with diversity within the
ICL set, remain effective when utilizing a large number of demonstrations. Our
experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more
examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee
improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands
of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract
ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM
attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the
context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results
show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely
long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a
smaller number of output classes.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型推理模型中的“自我肯定反思”现象，提出了一种无需训练的抑制方法，显著减少了输出长度且不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法缺乏对推理步骤的细粒度分析，尤其是“自我肯定反思”现象，导致输出长度增加。

Method: 通过分析句子开头的概率偏差定位“自我肯定反思”，并提出抑制方法，包括无需训练和基于训练的策略。

Result: 实验显示，抑制“自我肯定反思”可将输出长度压缩18.7%（无需训练）和50.2%（基于训练），且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为高效推理提供了简单实用的方法，可直接应用于现有推理框架，推动更精确的长度压缩和步骤级优化。

Abstract: While recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance, efficient reasoning remains critical due to the rapid growth of
output length. Existing optimization approaches highlights a tendency toward
"overthinking", yet lack fine-grained analysis. In this work, we focus on
Self-Affirmation Reflections: redundant reflective steps that affirm prior
content and often occurs after the already correct reasoning steps.
Observations of both original and optimized reasoning models reveal pervasive
self-affirmation reflections. Notably, these reflections sometimes lead to
longer outputs in optimized models than their original counterparts. Through
detailed analysis, we uncover an intriguing pattern: compared to other
reflections, the leading words (i.e., the first word of sentences) in
self-affirmation reflections exhibit a distinct probability bias. Motivated by
this insight, we can locate self-affirmation reflections and conduct a
train-free experiment demonstrating that suppressing self-affirmation
reflections reduces output length without degrading accuracy across multiple
models (R1-Distill-Models, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3-32B). Furthermore, we also
improve current train-based method by explicitly suppressing such reflections.
In our experiments, we achieve length compression of 18.7\% in train-free
settings and 50.2\% in train-based settings for R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Moreover,
our improvements are simple yet practical and can be directly applied to
existing inference frameworks, such as vLLM. We believe that our findings will
provide community insights for achieving more precise length compression and
step-level efficient reasoning.

Abstract: This survey paper outlines the key developments in the field of Large
Language Models (LLMs), such as enhancing their reasoning skills, adaptability
to various tasks, increased computational efficiency, and ability to make
ethical decisions. The techniques that have been most effective in bridging the
gap between human and machine communications include the Chain-of-Thought
prompting, Instruction Tuning, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
The improvements in multimodal learning and few-shot or zero-shot techniques
have further empowered LLMs to handle complex jobs with minor input. They also
manage to do more with less by applying scaling and optimization tricks for
computing power conservation. This survey also offers a broader perspective on
recent advancements in LLMs going beyond isolated aspects such as model
architecture or ethical concerns. It categorizes emerging methods that enhance
LLM reasoning, efficiency, and ethical alignment. It also identifies
underexplored areas such as interpretability, cross-modal integration and
sustainability. With recent progress, challenges like huge computational costs,
biases, and ethical risks remain constant. Addressing these requires bias
mitigation, transparent decision-making, and clear ethical guidelines. Future
research will focus on enhancing models ability to handle multiple input,
thereby making them more intelligent, safe, and reliable.

Result: 结果显示提取性能下降时，指标偏差显著增加，且现有错误模型无法准确模拟这些偏差。

Conclusion: 结论强调了改进提取方法和错误模型的必要性，以确保下游分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are useful for analyzing social structures, community
dynamics, institutional memberships, and other complex relationships across
domains from sociology to public health. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) have improved the scalability and accessibility of
automated KG extraction from large text corpora, the impacts of extraction
errors on downstream analyses are poorly understood, especially for applied
scientists who depend on accurate KGs for real-world insights. To address this
gap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two
levels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP
evaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level
graph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and
connectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications. Focusing on
affiliation graphs of person membership in organizations extracted from social
register books, our study identifies a range of extraction performance where
biases across most downstream graph analysis metrics are near zero. However, as
extraction performance declines, we find that many metrics exhibit increasingly
pronounced biases, with each metric tending toward a consistent direction of
either over- or under-estimation. Through simulations, we further show that
error models commonly used in the literature do not capture these bias
patterns, indicating the need for more realistic error models for KG
extraction. Our findings provide actionable insights for practitioners and
underscores the importance of advancing extraction methods and error modeling
to ensure reliable and meaningful downstream analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The release of
open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen has triggered the development of numerous
fine-tuned models tailored for various tasks and languages. In this paper, we
explore an important question: is it possible to combine these specialized
models to create a unified model with multi-task capabilities. We introduces
Hierarchical Iterative Merging (Hi-Merging), a training-free method for
unifying different specialized LLMs into a single model. Specifically,
Hi-Merging employs model-wise and layer-wise pruning and scaling, guided by
contribution analysis, to mitigate parameter conflicts. Extensive experiments
on multiple-choice and question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English
validate Hi-Merging's ability for multi-task learning. The results demonstrate
that Hi-Merging consistently outperforms existing merging techniques and
surpasses the performance of models fine-tuned on combined datasets in most
scenarios. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 语言分组专家化有助于新语言适应，并减少对已有多语言知识的推理依赖。

Abstract: The curse of multilinguality phenomenon is a fundamental problem of
multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), where the competition between
massive languages results in inferior performance. It mainly comes from limited
capacity and negative transfer between dissimilar languages. To address this
issue, we propose a method to dynamically group and scale up the parameters of
multilingual LLM while boosting positive transfer among similar languages.
Specifically, the model is first tuned on monolingual corpus to determine the
parameter deviation in each layer and quantify the similarity between
languages. Layers with more deviations are extended to mixture-of-experts
layers to reduce competition between languages, where one expert module serves
one group of similar languages. Experimental results on 18 to 128 languages
show that our method reduces the negative transfer between languages and
significantly boosts multilingual performance with fewer parameters. Such
language group specialization on experts benefits the new language adaptation
and reduces the inference on the previous multilingual knowledge learned.

Motivation: 验证语言模型是否能捕捉多样化的文化道德价值观，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较不同规模的语言模型（如GPT-2、GPT-4o等），使用对数概率道德合理性评分与人类调查数据关联。

Result: 先进指令调优模型（如GPT-4o）与人类道德判断的相关性显著高于早期或小型模型。

Conclusion: 模型规模和指令调优能提升道德价值观的跨文化对齐，但某些主题和地区仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across many tasks,
but their ability to capture culturally diverse moral values remains unclear.
In this paper, we examine whether LLMs can mirror variations in moral attitudes
reported by two major cross-cultural surveys: the World Values Survey and the
PEW Research Center's Global Attitudes Survey. We compare smaller, monolingual,
and multilingual models (GPT-2, OPT, BLOOMZ, and Qwen) with more recent
instruction-tuned models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Gemma-2-9b-it, and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct). Using log-probability-based moral justifiability
scores, we correlate each model's outputs with survey data covering a broad set
of ethical topics. Our results show that many earlier or smaller models often
produce near-zero or negative correlations with human judgments. In contrast,
advanced instruction-tuned models (including GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) achieve
substantially higher positive correlations, suggesting they better reflect
real-world moral attitudes. While scaling up model size and using instruction
tuning can improve alignment with cross-cultural moral norms, challenges remain
for certain topics and regions. We discuss these findings in relation to bias
analysis, training data diversity, and strategies for improving the cultural
sensitivity of LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their
efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided
search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from
a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards
for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the
policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address
this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue
that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring
coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference
Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences.
Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework
integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial
evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments
on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM
substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement
in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.

Motivation: 探索LLMs中间层自然表示对齐的现象及其对语言特定和语言无关信息解耦的潜在影响。

Method: 通过实证分析确认对齐现象，提出Inference-Time Language Control（ITLC）方法，利用潜在注入实现跨语言控制。

Result: ITLC在跨语言控制中表现优异，同时保持目标语言的语义完整性，有效缓解语言混淆问题。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLMs表示对齐的理解，并提供了提升跨语言性能的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across tasks and languages, revolutionizing natural language
processing. This paper investigates the naturally emerging representation
alignment in LLMs, particularly in the middle layers, and its implications for
disentangling language-specific and language-agnostic information. We
empirically confirm the existence of this alignment, analyze its behavior in
comparison to explicitly designed alignment models, and demonstrate its
potential for language-specific manipulation without semantic degradation.
Building on these findings, we propose Inference-Time Language Control (ITLC),
a novel method that leverages latent injection to enable precise cross-lingual
language control and mitigate language confusion in LLMs. Our experiments
highlight ITLC's strong cross-lingual control capabilities while preserving
semantic integrity in target languages. Furthermore, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in alleviating the cross-lingual language confusion problem,
which persists even in current large-scale LLMs, leading to inconsistent
language generation. This work advances our understanding of representation
alignment in LLMs and introduces a practical solution for enhancing their
cross-lingual performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种情感感知的SDP增强模块（SSDP-SEM），通过多任务学习提升金融领域的关系抽取（RE）任务，结合情感感知和句法信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域的关系抽取受情感因素影响，但现有模型忽视了这一点。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出SSDP-SEM模块，通过可插拔的辅助情感感知任务（ASP）和多任务学习，结合情感标记和最短依赖路径（SDP）。

Result: 实验表明，大多数现有模型通过辅助任务提升了性能，验证了情感信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 情感信息在金融关系抽取中具有重要作用，SSDP-SEM模块能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) aims to extract semantic relationships in texts from
given entity pairs, and has achieved significant improvements. However, in
different domains, the RE task can be influenced by various factors. For
example, in the financial domain, sentiment can affect RE results, yet this
factor has been overlooked by modern RE models. To address this gap, this paper
proposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task
learning approach for enhancing financial RE. Specifically, SSDP-SEM integrates
the RE models with a pluggable auxiliary sentiment perception (ASP) task,
enabling the RE models to concurrently navigate their attention weights with
the text's sentiment. We first generate detailed sentiment tokens through a
sentiment model and insert these tokens into an instance. Then, the ASP task
focuses on capturing nuanced sentiment information through predicting the
sentiment token positions, combining both sentiment insights and the Shortest
Dependency Path (SDP) of syntactic information. Moreover, this work employs a
sentiment attention information bottleneck regularization method to regulate
the reasoning process. Our experiment integrates this auxiliary task with
several prevalent frameworks, and the results demonstrate that most previous
models benefit from the auxiliary task, thereby achieving better results. These
findings highlight the importance of effectively leveraging sentiment in the
financial RE task.

Abstract: Model routing allocates queries to the suitable model, improving system
performance while reducing costs. However, existing routing methods face
practical limitations that hinder scalability in large-scale applications and
struggle to keep up with the rapid growth of the large language model (LLM)
ecosystem. To tackle these challenges, we propose TagRouter, a training-free

open-domain text generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
TagRouter outperforms 13 baseline methods, increasing the accept rate of system

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过知识增强方法减少大语言模型在对话生成中的幻觉问题，并改进了事实性评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在对话生成中容易产生幻觉（不准确或虚构的内容），影响事实性，因此需要知识增强方法来提升准确性。

Method: 框架结合知识三元组检索器、对话重写和知识增强的响应生成，同时提出改进的事实分数评估方法。

Result: 在OpendialKG和HybriDialogue数据集上，该方法显著优于其他基线模型（如G-retriever）。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了对话生成的事实性，并提供了更可靠的事实性评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in many natural language processing
tasks. However, their tendency to hallucinate - generate plausible but
inconsistent or factually incorrect text - can cause problems in certain tasks,
including response generation in dialogue. To mitigate this issue,
knowledge-augmented methods have shown promise in reducing hallucinations.
Here, we introduce a novel framework designed to enhance the factuality of
dialogue response generation, as well as an approach to evaluate dialogue
factual accuracy. Our framework combines a knowledge triple retriever, a
dialogue rewrite, and knowledge-enhanced response generation to produce more
accurate and grounded dialogue responses. To further evaluate generated
responses, we propose a revised fact score that addresses the limitations of
existing fact-score methods in dialogue settings, providing a more reliable
assessment of factual consistency. We evaluate our methods using different
baselines on the OpendialKG and HybriDialogue datasets. Our methods
significantly improve factuality compared to other graph knowledge-augmentation
baselines, including the state-of-the-art G-retriever. The code will be
released on GitHub.

Result: 模型在仇恨言论检测、平均对抗公平性和群体公平性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究填补了荷兰语对抗公平性研究的空白，为提升模型性能和公平性提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Numerous studies have proposed computational methods to detect hate speech
online, yet most focus on the English language and emphasize model development.
In this study, we evaluate the counterfactual fairness of hate speech detection
models in the Dutch language, specifically examining the performance and
fairness of transformer-based models. We make the following key contributions.
First, we curate a list of Dutch Social Group Terms that reflect social
context. Second, we generate counterfactual data for Dutch hate speech using
LLMs and established strategies like Manual Group Substitution (MGS) and
Sentence Log-Likelihood (SLL). Through qualitative evaluation, we highlight the
challenges of generating realistic counterfactuals, particularly with Dutch
grammar and contextual coherence. Third, we fine-tune baseline
transformer-based models with counterfactual data and evaluate their
performance in detecting hate speech. Fourth, we assess the fairness of these
models using Counterfactual Token Fairness (CTF) and group fairness metrics,
including equality of odds and demographic parity. Our analysis shows that
models perform better in terms of hate speech detection, average counterfactual
fairness and group fairness. This work addresses a significant gap in the
literature on counterfactual fairness for hate speech detection in Dutch and
provides practical insights and recommendations for improving both model
performance and fairness.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，其性别偏见问题引发了严重的社会影响，因此检测、分类和缓解性别偏见成为关键研究方向。

Method: 采用强化学习、链式推理（CoT）和监督微调方法，分别处理不同子任务。对于子任务1和2，利用模型的内部推理能力分阶段引导多步思考；对于子任务3，使用基于强化学习的方法，通过GPT-4标注偏好数据集，并应用直接偏好优化（DPO）减少偏见。

Result: 该方法在NLPCC 2025共享任务7的所有三个子任务中均排名第一。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合强化学习和链式推理的方法能有效提升大型语言模型在性别偏见检测、分类和缓解方面的能力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they have
significantly improved efficiency across a wide range of domains. However,
recent studies have revealed that LLMs often exhibit gender bias, leading to
serious social implications. Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias
in LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025
Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and
Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in
gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement
learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to
handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the
internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a
staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response
accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach,
annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that
explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked
first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

Conclusion: 通过优化关键组件和引入新方法，论文显著提升了SLMs的性能，为跨模态对齐和高质量语音生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-language models (SLMs) offer a promising path toward unifying speech
and text understanding and generation. However, challenges remain in achieving
effective cross-modal alignment and high-quality speech generation. In this
work, we systematically investigate the impact of key components (i.e., speech
tokenizers, speech heads, and speaker modeling) on the performance of
LLM-centric SLMs. We compare coupled, semi-decoupled, and fully decoupled
speech tokenizers under a fair SLM framework and find that decoupled
tokenization significantly improves alignment and synthesis quality. To address
the information density mismatch between speech and text, we introduce
multi-token prediction (MTP) into SLMs, enabling each hidden state to decode
multiple speech tokens. This leads to up to 12$\times$ faster decoding and a
substantial drop in word error rate (from 6.07 to 3.01). Furthermore, we
propose a speaker-aware generation paradigm and introduce RoleTriviaQA, a
large-scale role-playing knowledge QA benchmark with diverse speaker
identities. Experiments demonstrate that our methods enhance both knowledge
understanding and speaker consistency.

encompassing multimodal content and diverse domains. Our evaluation framework
further introduces the Unknown Rate (UnR) metric, enabling a more nuanced
assessment of models' ability to handle uncertainty and balance between
over-conservatism and over-confidence. Extensive experiments on 7

Conclusion: 该方法为评估新闻媒体提供了有效工具，并公开了数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation
online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are
reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic
fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited
information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the
political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news
outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but
understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic
and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in
social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the
criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and
political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of
prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models
(LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating
sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with
multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media
popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation
study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these
improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DoTA-RAG (Dynamic-of-Thought Aggregation RAG), a
retrieval-augmented generation system optimized for high-throughput,
large-scale web knowledge indexes. Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from
high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG
addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting,
dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and
ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior
embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we
create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana
setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG
improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG
pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves
a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight
DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast,

Conclusion: CORGI-PM为中文性别偏见研究提供了高质量资源，推动了自动化偏见消除技术的发展。

Abstract: As natural language processing for gender bias becomes a significant
interdisciplinary topic, the prevalent data-driven techniques, such as
pre-trained language models, suffer from biased corpus. This case becomes more
obvious regarding those languages with less fairness-related computational
linguistic resources, such as Chinese. To this end, we propose a Chinese cOrpus
foR Gender bIas Probing and Mitigation (CORGI-PM), which contains 32.9k
sentences with high-quality labels derived by following an annotation scheme
specifically developed for gender bias in the Chinese context. It is worth
noting that CORGI-PM contains 5.2k gender-biased sentences along with the
corresponding bias-eliminated versions rewritten by human annotators. We pose
three challenges as a shared task to automate the mitigation of textual gender
bias, which requires the models to detect, classify, and mitigate textual
gender bias. In the literature, we present the results and analysis for the
teams participating this shared task in NLPCC 2025.

Motivation: 现有方法仅能针对预定义主题调整SAE神经元，且需参数调优。本文旨在实现更灵活、高效的对齐。

Method: 通过计算SAE神经元与对齐文本的语义相似度评分，并强调主题对齐神经元来修改SAE层输出。

Result: 在多个公开数据集（如Amazon评论、医学、奉承）上验证，相比微调，语言可接受性提高（0.25 vs. 0.5），训练时间大幅减少（333.6s vs. 62s），推理时间可接受（+0.00092s/词）。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM输出对齐提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于广泛主题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent work shows that Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) applied to large language
model (LLM) layers have neurons corresponding to interpretable concepts. These
SAE neurons can be modified to align generated outputs, but only towards
pre-identified topics and with some parameter tuning. Our approach leverages
the observational and modification properties of SAEs to enable alignment for
any topic. This method 1) scores each SAE neuron by its semantic similarity to
an alignment text and uses them to 2) modify SAE-layer-level outputs by
emphasizing topic-aligned neurons. We assess the alignment capabilities of this
approach on diverse public topic datasets including Amazon reviews, Medicine,
and Sycophancy, across the currently available open-source LLMs and SAE pairs
(GPT2 and Gemma) with multiple SAEs configurations. Experiments aligning to
medical prompts reveal several benefits over fine-tuning, including increased
average language acceptability (0.25 vs. 0.5), reduced training time across
multiple alignment topics (333.6s vs. 62s), and acceptable inference time for
many applications (+0.00092s/token). Our open-source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在结合结构化外部知识（如知识图谱、代码片段或形式逻辑）进行推理时表现不佳，缺乏系统性评估基准。

Method: 提出OneEval基准，涵盖四种结构化知识模态和五个关键领域，包含4,019个实例和1,285个高难度案例，评估了18种先进LLMs。

Result: 发现LLMs在结构化推理中存在持续局限性（最高准确率仅32.2%），性能随知识结构复杂性增加而下降，且长推理链收益递减。

Conclusion: OneEval基准揭示了LLMs在结构化知识推理中的不足，为未来研究提供了工具和方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress on
reasoning tasks involving unstructured text, yet their capabilities
significantly deteriorate when reasoning requires integrating structured
external knowledge such as knowledge graphs, code snippets, or formal logic.
This limitation is partly due to the absence of benchmarks capable of
systematically evaluating LLM performance across diverse structured knowledge
modalities. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textsc{OneEval}}, a
comprehensive benchmark explicitly designed to assess the knowledge-intensive
reasoning capabilities of LLMs across four structured knowledge modalities,
unstructured text, knowledge graphs, code, and formal logic, and five critical
domains (general knowledge, government, science, law, and programming).
\textsc{OneEval} comprises 4,019 carefully curated instances and includes a
challenging subset, \textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}, consisting of 1,285
particularly difficult cases. Through extensive evaluation of 18
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, we establish three core
findings: a) \emph{persistent limitations in structured reasoning}, with even
the strongest model achieving only 32.2\% accuracy on
\textsc{OneEval}\textsubscript{Hard}; b) \emph{performance consistently
declines as the structural complexity of the knowledge base increases}, with
accuracy dropping sharply from 53\% (textual reasoning) to 25\% (formal logic);
and c) \emph{diminishing returns from extended reasoning chains}, highlighting
the critical need for models to adapt reasoning depth appropriately to task
complexity. We release the \textsc{OneEval} datasets, evaluation scripts, and
baseline results publicly, accompanied by a leaderboard to facilitate ongoing

TL;DR: Mamba-based HuBERT模型在语音自监督学习中表现出色，尤其在长上下文ASR和流式ASR中优于Transformer模型，同时在SUPERB基准测试中表现竞争性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Mamba在语音自监督学习中的潜力，弥补现有研究仅局限于孤立任务的不足。

Method: 采用基于线性时间选择性状态空间的Mamba模型，替代传统的Transformer架构，进行HuBERT模型的训练和微调。

Result: Mamba模型在长上下文ASR中计算成本更低，流式ASR性能更优，SUPERB基准测试中表现竞争性，且量化表示质量和说话人特征捕捉更突出。

Conclusion: Mamba-based SSL为长序列建模、实时语音建模和语音单元提取提供了有前景的补充方向。

Abstract: While Mamba has demonstrated strong performance in language modeling, its
potential as a speech self-supervised (SSL) model remains underexplored, with
prior studies limited to isolated tasks. To address this, we explore
Mamba-based HuBERT models as alternatives to Transformer-based SSL
architectures. Leveraging the linear-time Selective State Space, these models
enable fine-tuning on long-context ASR with significantly lower compute.
Moreover, they show superior performance when fine-tuned for streaming ASR.
Beyond fine-tuning, these models show competitive performance on SUPERB probing
benchmarks, particularly in causal settings. Our analysis shows that they yield
higher-quality quantized representations and capture speaker-related features
more distinctly than Transformer-based models. These findings highlight
Mamba-based SSL as a promising and complementary direction for long-sequence
modeling, real-time speech modeling, and speech unit extraction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过增强语言模型对资产维护的理解来优化工程师决策的方法，结合LLM和ReAct代理，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升语言模型在工业4.0领域中对资产维护任务的理解能力，以减少资产停机时间并支持工程师决策。

Method: 构建专家知识库和任务数据集，利用LLM增强输入任务描述，结合ReAct代理进行多步推理和知识推断。

Result: 实验显示，LLM增强显著提升嵌入质量，对比损失方法表现更优，HIT@1、MAP@100和NDCG@10分别提升54.2%、50.1%和54.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持工业资产维护的复杂问题解答，提升了专家日常操作的效率。

Abstract: In this work we focus on improving language models' understanding for asset
maintenance to guide the engineer's decisions and minimize asset downtime.
Given a set of tasks expressed in natural language for Industry 4.0 domain,
each associated with queries related to a specific asset, we want to recommend
relevant items and generalize to queries of similar assets. A task may involve
identifying relevant sensors given a query about an asset's failure mode.
  Our approach begins with gathering a qualitative, expert-vetted knowledge
base to construct nine asset-specific task datasets. To create more
contextually informed embeddings, we augment the input tasks using Large
Language Models (LLMs), providing concise descriptions of the entities involved
in the queries. This embedding model is then integrated with a Reasoning and
Acting agent (ReAct), which serves as a powerful tool for answering complex
user queries that require multi-step reasoning, planning, and knowledge
inference.
  Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that: (a) LLM query augmentation
improves the quality of embeddings, (b) Contrastive loss and other methods that
avoid in-batch negatives are superior for datasets with queries related to many
items, and (c) It is crucial to balance positive and negative in-batch samples.
After training and testing on our dataset, we observe a substantial
improvement: HIT@1 increases by +54.2%, MAP@100 by +50.1%, and NDCG@10 by
+54.7%, averaged across all tasks and models. Additionally, we empirically
demonstrate the model's planning and tool invocation capabilities when
answering complex questions related to industrial asset maintenance, showcasing
its effectiveness in supporting Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in their
day-to-day operations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Konooz是一个多维阿拉伯语语料库，涵盖16种方言和10个领域，包含777k个标记，并标注了21种实体类型。论文主要评估了现有阿拉伯语命名实体识别（NER）模型的跨领域和跨方言性能，发现性能下降高达38%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补阿拉伯语多方言和多领域NER任务的资源空白，并评估现有模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用Konooz语料库对四种阿拉伯语NER模型进行基准测试，分析领域和方言差异的影响，并采用MMD度量领域和方言间的重叠。

Result: 模型在跨领域和跨方言任务中性能显著下降（高达38%），且资源稀缺性对性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: Konooz为阿拉伯语NER研究提供了宝贵资源，揭示了模型泛化的挑战，并强调了领域和方言差异的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce Konooz, a novel multi-dimensional corpus covering 16 Arabic
dialects across 10 domains, resulting in 160 distinct corpora. The corpus
comprises about 777k tokens, carefully collected and manually annotated with 21
entity types using both nested and flat annotation schemes - using the Wojood
guidelines. While Konooz is useful for various NLP tasks like domain adaptation
and transfer learning, this paper primarily focuses on benchmarking existing
Arabic Named Entity Recognition (NER) models, especially cross-domain and
cross-dialect model performance. Our benchmarking of four Arabic NER models
using Konooz reveals a significant drop in performance of up to 38% when
compared to the in-distribution data. Furthermore, we present an in-depth
analysis of domain and dialect divergence and the impact of resource scarcity.
We also measured the overlap between domains and dialects using the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, and illustrated why certain NER models perform
better on specific dialects and domains. Konooz is open-source and publicly
available at https://sina.birzeit.edu/wojood/#download

TL;DR: OpenUnlearning是一个标准化框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）的遗忘方法和指标，整合了多种算法和评估标准，并提出了新的元评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据隐私、模型安全和法规遵从的需求，LLM的稳健遗忘至关重要，但当前方法分散且评估指标不一致，阻碍了研究和复现。

Method: 开发了OpenUnlearning框架，整合了9种遗忘算法和16种评估方法，覆盖3个基准数据集，并分析了450多个检查点的遗忘行为。

Result: 提出了新的元评估基准，用于评估指标的忠实性和稳健性，并对多种遗忘方法进行了比较分析。

Conclusion: OpenUnlearning为LLM遗忘研究提供了统一的社区驱动路径，推动了该领域的严谨发展。

Abstract: Robust unlearning is crucial for safely deploying large language models
(LLMs) in environments where data privacy, model safety, and regulatory
compliance must be ensured. Yet the task is inherently challenging, partly due
to difficulties in reliably measuring whether unlearning has truly occurred.
Moreover, fragmentation in current methodologies and inconsistent evaluation
metrics hinder comparative analysis and reproducibility. To unify and
accelerate research efforts, we introduce OpenUnlearning, a standardized and
extensible framework designed explicitly for benchmarking both LLM unlearning
methods and metrics. OpenUnlearning integrates 9 unlearning algorithms and 16
diverse evaluations across 3 leading benchmarks (TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP) and also
enables analyses of forgetting behaviors across 450+ checkpoints we publicly
release. Leveraging OpenUnlearning, we propose a novel meta-evaluation
benchmark focused specifically on assessing the faithfulness and robustness of
evaluation metrics themselves. We also benchmark diverse unlearning methods and
provide a comparative analysis against an extensive evaluation suite. Overall,
we establish a clear, community-driven pathway toward rigorous development in
LLM unlearning research.

Motivation: 研究AI生成的诗句如何作为艺术创作的灵感来源，探索不同AI方法在激发创造力上的差异。

Method: 分析了LSTM-VAE和LLM生成的诗歌，通过创作一首原创诗验证LSTM-VAE的启发性。

Result: LSTM-VAE生成的句子因其语义开放性和非常规组合更能激发艺术家的创造力，而LLM的诗歌则更传统。

Conclusion: LSTM-VAE生成的句子因其开放性和非常规性，更适合作为艺术创作的起点。

Abstract: Artistic inspiration often emerges from language that is open to
interpretation. This paper explores the use of AI-generated poetic lines as
stimuli for creativity. Through analysis of two generative AI approaches--lines
generated by Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoders (LSTM-VAE) and
complete poems by Large Language Models (LLMs)--I demonstrate that LSTM-VAE
lines achieve their evocative impact through a combination of resonant imagery
and productive indeterminacy. While LLMs produce technically accomplished
poetry with conventional patterns, LSTM-VAE lines can engage the artist through
semantic openness, unconventional combinations, and fragments that resist
closure. Through the composition of an original poem, where narrative emerged
organically through engagement with LSTM-VAE generated lines rather than
following a predetermined structure, I demonstrate how these characteristics
can serve as evocative starting points for authentic artistic expression.

Motivation: 维基百科是现代自然语言处理的重要资源，但其内容的可靠性（即是否基于引用来源）是关键。本文旨在量化分析维基百科的可靠性及证据检索的便捷性。

Method: 引入PeopleProfiles数据集，对维基百科名人文章中的声明支持进行大规模、多层次的标注分析。

Result: 20%的导言声明和27%的正文声明缺乏来源支持；80%的导言声明无法通过正文追溯到来源；复杂证据检索对现有方法仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 维基百科的可靠性存在显著问题，尤其是导言部分；现有检索方法在证据支持方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Wikipedia is a critical resource for modern NLP, serving as a rich repository
of up-to-date and citation-backed information on a wide variety of subjects.
The reliability of Wikipedia -- its groundedness in its cited sources -- is
vital to this purpose. This work provides a quantitative analysis of the extent
to which Wikipedia *is* so grounded and of how readily grounding evidence may
be retrieved. To this end, we introduce PeopleProfiles -- a large-scale,
multi-level dataset of claim support annotations on Wikipedia articles of
notable people. We show that roughly 20% of claims in Wikipedia *lead* sections
are unsupported by the article body; roughly 27% of annotated claims in the
article *body* are unsupported by their (publicly accessible) cited sources;
and >80% of lead claims cannot be traced to these sources via annotated body
evidence. Further, we show that recovery of complex grounding evidence for
claims that *are* supported remains a challenge for standard retrieval methods.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在道德敏感领域中，人物特质如何影响其道德推理和说服行为。通过模拟AI-AI辩论，发现政治意识形态和人格特质对辩论结果影响最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在道德敏感领域的广泛应用，了解人物特质对其行为的影响变得至关重要。

Method: 使用6维人物特质空间（年龄、性别、国家、阶级、意识形态和人格）模拟了131个基于关系的道德困境辩论。

Result: 人物特质影响初始道德立场和辩论结果，政治意识形态和人格特质影响最强。自由派和开放性人格更容易达成共识和获胜。

Conclusion: 研究结果与心理学和文化研究一致，强调了在AI道德推理中考虑人物特质的必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in morally sensitive
domains, it is crucial to understand how persona traits affect their moral
reasoning and persuasive behavior. We present the first large-scale study of
multi-dimensional persona effects in AI-AI debates over real-world moral
dilemmas. Using a 6-dimensional persona space (age, gender, country, class,
ideology, and personality), we simulate structured debates between AI agents
over 131 relationship-based cases. Our results show that personas affect
initial moral stances and debate outcomes, with political ideology and
personality traits exerting the strongest influence. Persuasive success varies
across traits, with liberal and open personalities reaching higher consensus
and win rates. While logit-based confidence grows during debates, emotional and
credibility-based appeals diminish, indicating more tempered argumentation over
time. These trends mirror findings from psychology and cultural studies,
reinforcing the need for persona-aware evaluation frameworks for AI moral
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管临床基础模型常使用脱敏文本训练，但其影响尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 预训练多个编码器模型，分别使用脱敏文本和伪文本替换的数据集，并在去识别任务上微调。

Result: 提出的方法显著优于基线，并提供了训练建议、伪数据集生成工具和开源代码。

Conclusion: 伪文本替换方法有效，为隐私保护下的模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many models are pretrained on redacted text for privacy reasons. Clinical
foundation models are often trained on de-identified text, which uses special
syntax (masked) text in place of protected health information. Even though
these models have increased in popularity, there has been little effort in
understanding the effects of training them on redacted text. In this work, we
pretrain several encoder-only models on a dataset that contains redacted text
and a version with replaced realistic pseudo text. We then fine-tuned models
for the protected health information de-identification task and show how our
methods significantly outperform previous baselines. The contributions of this
work include: a) our novel, and yet surprising findings with training
recommendations, b) redacted text replacements used to produce the pseudo
dataset, c) pretrained embeddings and fine-tuned task specific models, and d)
freely available pseudo training dataset generation and model source code used
in our experiments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种灵活的语言模型对齐框架，支持训练和推理中对齐程度的定量控制，显著减少资源消耗并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当语言模型性能未达预期时，需重新对齐。现有方法在资源消耗和灵活性上不足，需改进。

Method: 框架包含训练时对齐（TrRa）和推理时对齐（InRa）。TrRa通过可控融合参考模型和对齐模型的logits实现高效对齐；InRa通过层适配器实现平滑推理对齐。

Result: TrRa在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上减少54.63%的token使用，性能无下降；InRa使模型支持快慢思考，甚至超越原性能。

Conclusion: 该框架灵活高效，显著提升语言模型对齐效果，适用于训练和推理阶段。

Abstract: Realignment becomes necessary when a language model (LM) fails to meet
expected performance. We propose a flexible realignment framework that supports
quantitative control of alignment degree during training and inference. This
framework incorporates Training-time Realignment (TrRa), which efficiently
realigns the reference model by leveraging the controllable fusion of logits
from both the reference and already aligned models. For example, TrRa reduces
token usage by 54.63% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B without any performance
degradation, outperforming DeepScaleR-1.5B's 33.86%. To complement TrRa during
inference, we introduce a layer adapter that enables smooth Inference-time
Realignment (InRa). This adapter is initialized to perform an identity
transformation at the bottom layer and is inserted preceding the original
layers. During inference, input embeddings are simultaneously processed by the
adapter and the original layer, followed by the remaining layers, and then
controllably interpolated at the logit level. We upgraded
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from a slow-thinking model to one that supports
both fast and slow thinking, allowing flexible alignment control even during
inference. By encouraging deeper reasoning, it even surpassed its original
performance.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在检测多语言和复杂文化背景下的仇恨言论中的优越性，并通过IndoHateMix数据集验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仇恨言论检测面临语言多样性和非正式网络表达的挑战，尤其是在涉及代码混合和音译的复杂场景中。

Method: 引入IndoHateMix数据集，比较LLMs（如LLaMA-3.1）与微调BERT模型在仇恨言论检测中的表现。

Result: LLMs在数据量较少的情况下仍显著优于BERT模型，展现了更强的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: LLMs为仇恨言论检测提供了变革性方法，未来研究可能更倾向于丰富数据集而非开发专用模型。

Abstract: Hate speech detection across contemporary social media presents unique
challenges due to linguistic diversity and the informal nature of online
discourse. These challenges are further amplified in settings involving
code-mixing, transliteration, and culturally nuanced expressions. While
fine-tuned transformer models, such as BERT, have become standard for this
task, we argue that recent large language models (LLMs) not only surpass them
but also redefine the landscape of hate speech detection more broadly. To
support this claim, we introduce IndoHateMix, a diverse, high-quality dataset
capturing Hindi-English code-mixing and transliteration in the Indian context,
providing a realistic benchmark to evaluate model robustness in complex
multilingual scenarios where existing NLP methods often struggle. Our extensive
experiments show that cutting-edge LLMs (such as LLaMA-3.1) consistently
outperform task-specific BERT-based models, even when fine-tuned on
significantly less data. With their superior generalization and adaptability,
LLMs offer a transformative approach to mitigating online hate in diverse
environments. This raises the question of whether future works should
prioritize developing specialized models or focus on curating richer and more
varied datasets to further enhance the effectiveness of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在全球政治意识形态中的潜在偏见，尤其是民主与威权主义价值体系的倾向性，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 结合F-scale（测量威权倾向的心理测量工具）、FavScore（评估模型对世界领导人好感度的新指标）和角色模型探测方法。

Result: LLMs总体上偏向民主价值观，但在中文提示下对威权主义人物表现出更高的好感度，并常将威权人物作为角色模型引用。

Conclusion: LLMs可能反映并强化全球政治意识形态，强调了超越传统社会政治轴线的偏见评估的重要性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into everyday
life and information ecosystems, concerns about their implicit biases continue
to persist. While prior work has primarily examined socio-demographic and
left--right political dimensions, little attention has been paid to how LLMs
align with broader geopolitical value systems, particularly the
democracy--authoritarianism spectrum. In this paper, we propose a novel
methodology to assess such alignment, combining (1) the F-scale, a psychometric
tool for measuring authoritarian tendencies, (2) FavScore, a newly introduced
metric for evaluating model favorability toward world leaders, and (3)
role-model probing to assess which figures are cited as general role-models by
LLMs. We find that LLMs generally favor democratic values and leaders, but
exhibit increases favorability toward authoritarian figures when prompted in
Mandarin. Further, models are found to often cite authoritarian figures as role
models, even outside explicit political contexts. These results shed light on
ways LLMs may reflect and potentially reinforce global political ideologies,
highlighting the importance of evaluating bias beyond conventional
socio-political axes. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习（ICL）在大语言模型中表现出色，但易受先验知识和上下文示例的偏见影响，现有方法难以适应动态上下文。

Method: 采用隐式顺序贝叶斯推理框架，提出SC方法，利用“惊讶”信号捕捉类别先验的动态变化。

Result: 实验表明，SC在多种自然语言处理任务中优于现有偏见校准技术。

Conclusion: SC为上下文学习提供了更自适应且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for task
adaptation in large language models (LLMs), where models infer underlying task
structures from a few demonstrations. However, ICL remains susceptible to
biases that arise from prior knowledge and contextual demonstrations, which can
degrade the performance of LLMs. Existing bias calibration methods typically
apply fixed class priors across all inputs, limiting their efficacy in dynamic
ICL settings where the context for each query differs. To address these
limitations, we adopt implicit sequential Bayesian inference as a framework for
interpreting ICL, identify "surprise" as an informative signal for class prior
shift, and introduce a novel method--Surprise Calibration (SC). SC leverages
the notion of surprise to capture the temporal dynamics of class priors,
providing a more adaptive and computationally efficient solution for in-context
learning. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of SC over existing bias
calibration techniques across a range of benchmark natural language processing
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）的发展，区分人类与AI生成文本的界限变得模糊。本文旨在通过对抗性修改GPT生成文本，使其更难被检测。

Method: 使用T5-small和BART等Seq2Seq模型对GPT生成的文本进行修改，增加语言、结构和语义上更接近人类写作的特征。

Result: 实验表明，修改后的文本显著降低了分类模型的检测准确率；但重新训练分类模型后，其能高精度区分修改后的GPT文本与人类文本。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了文本变换技术在攻击（欺骗分类模型）和防御（改进分类器）中的双重作用，深化了对AI生成文本的理解。

Abstract: Due to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the boundary
between human-written text and AI-generated text has become blurred.
Nevertheless, recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to reliably
detect GPT-generated text. In this paper, we adopt a novel strategy to
adversarially transform GPT-generated text using sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
models, with the goal of making the text more human-like. We experiment with
the Seq2Seq models T5-small and BART which serve to modify GPT-generated
sentences to include linguistic, structural, and semantic components that may
be more typical of human-authored text. Experiments show that classification
models trained to distinguish GPT-generated text are significantly less
accurate when tested on text that has been modified by these Seq2Seq models.
However, after retraining classification models on data generated by our
Seq2Seq technique, the models are able to distinguish the transformed
GPT-generated text from human-generated text with high accuracy. This work adds
to the accumulating knowledge of text transformation as a tool for both attack
-- in the sense of defeating classification models -- and defense -- in the
sense of improved classifiers -- thereby advancing our understanding of
AI-generated text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链推理模型在处理简单问题时存在过度推理问题，而短链推理模式在简单任务中更高效。研究旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出Question-Free Fine-Tuning (QFFT)，在训练中移除输入问题，仅从长链推理响应中学习，使模型能自适应选择推理模式。

Result: QFFT在数学数据集上平均减少50%以上的响应长度，性能与监督微调相当，且在噪声、域外和低资源场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: QFFT有效结合长短链推理模式，显著减少冗余推理，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning models have
improved performance on complex tasks, but they suffer from overthinking, which
generates redundant reasoning steps, especially for simple questions. This
paper revisits the reasoning patterns of Long and Short CoT models, observing
that the Short CoT patterns offer concise reasoning efficiently, while the Long
CoT patterns excel in challenging scenarios where the Short CoT patterns
struggle. To enable models to leverage both patterns, we propose Question-Free
Fine-Tuning (QFFT), a fine-tuning approach that removes the input question
during training and learns exclusively from Long CoT responses. This approach
enables the model to adaptively employ both reasoning patterns: it prioritizes
the Short CoT patterns and activates the Long CoT patterns only when necessary.
Experiments on various mathematical datasets demonstrate that QFFT reduces
average response length by more than 50\%, while achieving performance
comparable to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, QFFT exhibits
superior performance compared to SFT in noisy, out-of-domain, and low-resource
scenarios.

Abstract: This work presents three different approaches to address the ArchEHR-QA 2025
Shared Task on automated patient question answering. We introduce an end-to-end
prompt-based baseline and two two-step methods to divide the task, without
utilizing any external knowledge. Both two step approaches first extract
essential sentences from the clinical text, by prompt or similarity ranking,
and then generate the final answer from these notes. Results indicate that the
re-ranker based two-step system performs best, highlighting the importance of
selecting the right approach for each subtask. Our best run achieved an overall
score of 0.44, ranking 8th out of 30 on the leaderboard, securing the top
position in overall factuality.

Abstract: Legal passage retrieval is an important task that assists legal practitioners
in the time-intensive process of finding relevant precedents to support legal
arguments. This study investigates the task of retrieving legal passages or
paragraphs from decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU),
whose language is highly structured and formulaic, leading to repetitive
patterns. Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at
handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval
systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal
domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better
suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical
features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic
and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three
complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in
scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better
than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and
verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also
show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4
out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on
domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most
metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on
the model's performance and temporal robustness. The code, dataset and appendix

Conclusion: JEBS任务和数据集为生物医学术语替换系统的开发和评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Online medical literature has made health information more available than
ever, however, the barrier of complex medical jargon prevents the general
public from understanding it. Though parallel and comparable corpora for
Biomedical Text Simplification have been introduced, these conflate the many
syntactic and lexical operations involved in simplification. To enable more
targeted development and evaluation, we present a fine-grained lexical
simplification task and dataset, Jargon Explanations for Biomedical
Simplification (JEBS, https://github.com/bill-from-ri/JEBS-data ). The JEBS
task involves identifying complex terms, classifying how to replace them, and
generating replacement text. The JEBS dataset contains 21,595 replacements for
10,314 terms across 400 biomedical abstracts and their manually simplified
versions. Additionally, we provide baseline results for a variety of rule-based
and transformer-based systems for the three sub-tasks. The JEBS task, data, and
baseline results pave the way for development and rigorous evaluation of
systems for replacing or explaining complex biomedical terms.

Abstract: Advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning capabilities enables
them to solve scientific problems with enhanced efficacy. Thereby, a
high-quality benchmark for comprehensive and appropriate assessment holds
significance, while existing ones either confront the risk of data
contamination or lack involved disciplines. To be specific, due to the data
source overlap of LLMs training and static benchmark, the keys or number
pattern of answers inadvertently memorized (i.e. data contamination), leading
to systematic overestimation of their reasoning capabilities, especially
numerical reasoning. We propose SciDA, a multidisciplinary benchmark that
consists exclusively of over 1k Olympic-level numerical computation problems,
allowing randomized numerical initializations for each inference round to avoid
reliance on fixed numerical patterns. We conduct a series of experiments with
both closed-source and open-source top-performing LLMs, and it is observed that
the performance of LLMs drop significantly under random numerical
initialization. Thus, we provide truthful and unbiased assessments of the
numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The data is available at

Motivation: 随着LLM能力的提升，个性化响应成为重要研究方向，但缺乏高质量评估基准阻碍了进展。

Method: 提出PersonaFeedback基准，直接评估LLM基于明确用户角色的个性化响应能力，避免隐含角色推断的干扰。

Result: 实验显示，现有LLM在复杂个性化任务中表现不足，检索增强框架并非万能解决方案。

Conclusion: PersonaBenchmark为LLM个性化研究提供了公开数据和评估工具，推动领域发展。

Abstract: With the rapid improvement in the general capabilities of LLMs, LLM
personalization, i.e., how to build LLM systems that can generate personalized
responses or services that are tailored to distinct user personas, has become
an increasingly important research and engineering problem. However, unlike
many new challenging benchmarks being released for evaluating the
general/reasoning capabilities, the lack of high-quality benchmarks for
evaluating LLM personalization greatly hinders progress in this field. To
address this, we introduce PersonaFeedback, a new benchmark that directly
evaluates LLMs' ability to provide personalized responses given pre-defined
user personas and queries. Unlike existing benchmarks that require models to
infer implicit user personas from historical interactions, PersonaFeedback
decouples persona inference from personalization, focusing on evaluating the
model's ability to generate responses tailored to explicit personas.
PersonaFeedback consists of 8298 human-annotated test cases, which are
categorized into easy, medium, and hard tiers based on the contextual
complexity of the user personas and the difficulty in distinguishing subtle
differences between two personalized responses. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across a wide range of models. The empirical results reveal that
even state-of-the-art LLMs that can solve complex real-world reasoning tasks
could fall short on the hard tier of PersonaFeedback where even human
evaluators may find the distinctions challenging. Furthermore, we conduct an
in-depth analysis of failure modes across various types of systems,
demonstrating that the current retrieval-augmented framework should not be seen
as a de facto solution for personalization tasks. All benchmark data,
annotation protocols, and the evaluation pipeline will be publicly available to
facilitate future research on LLM personalization.

Result: 该方法在音频逻辑推理任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 结合高质量数据集和专用强化学习技术，推动了音频智能的前沿发展。

Abstract: While large language models have shown reasoning capabilities, their
application to the audio modality, particularly in large audio-language models
(ALMs), remains significantly underdeveloped. Addressing this gap requires a
systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality
reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this
study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical

specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource,
we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training
Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights
the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with
specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in

Abstract: In clinical operations, teamwork can be the crucial factor that determines
the final outcome. Prior studies have shown that sufficient collaboration is
the key factor that determines the outcome of an operation. To understand how
the team practices teamwork during the operation, we collected CliniDial from
simulations of medical operations. CliniDial includes the audio data and its
transcriptions, the simulated physiology signals of the patient manikins, and
how the team operates from two camera angles. We annotate behavior codes
following an existing framework to understand the teamwork process for
CliniDial. We pinpoint three main characteristics of our dataset, including its
label imbalances, rich and natural interactions, and multiple modalities, and
conduct experiments to test existing LLMs' capabilities on handling data with
these characteristics. Experimental results show that CliniDial poses
significant challenges to the existing models, inviting future effort on
developing methods that can deal with real-world clinical data. We open-source

Abstract: Bilingual and multilingual language models offer a promising path toward
scaling NLP systems across diverse languages and users. However, their
performance often varies wildly between languages as prior works show that
adding more languages can degrade performance for some languages (such as
English), while improving others (typically more data constrained languages).
In this work, we investigate causes of these inconsistencies by comparing
bilingual and monolingual language models. Our analysis reveals that unequal
data quality, not just data quantity, is a major driver of performance
degradation in bilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective data
filtering strategy to select higher-quality bilingual training data with only
high quality English data. Applied to French, German, and Chinese, our approach
improves monolingual performance by 2-4% and reduces bilingual model
performance gaps to 1%. These results highlight the overlooked importance of
data quality in multilingual pretraining and offer a practical recipe for
balancing performance.

Result: 自动和人工评估表明，该方法有效减少了词汇和信息层面的媒体偏见，同时提升了内容保留度。

Conclusion: 通过事件关系图引导的摘要生成方法能有效缓解媒体偏见，并保持内容完整性。

Abstract: Media outlets are becoming more partisan and polarized nowadays. Most
previous work focused on detecting media bias. In this paper, we aim to
mitigate media bias by generating a neutralized summary given multiple articles
presenting different ideological views. Motivated by the critical role of
events and event relations in media bias detection, we propose to increase
awareness of bias in LLMs via multi-document events reasoning and use a
multi-document event relation graph to guide the summarization process. This
graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types
of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event
coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral
opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two
strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for
neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language
descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text
prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert
the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt. Both automatic evaluation and
human evaluation confirm that our approach effectively mitigates both lexical
and informational media bias, and meanwhile improves content preservation.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线和其他方法，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下的ABSA提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，同时展示了句法知识在情感分析中的重要性。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) generally requires a deep
understanding of the contextual information, including the words associated
with the aspect terms and their syntactic dependencies. Most existing studies
employ advanced encoders (e.g., pre-trained models) to capture such context,
especially large language models (LLMs). However, training these encoders is
resource-intensive, and in many cases, the available data is insufficient for
necessary fine-tuning. Therefore it is challenging for learning LLMs within
such restricted environments and computation efficiency requirement. As a
result, it motivates the exploration of plug-and-play methods that adapt LLMs
to ABSA with minimal effort. In this paper, we propose an approach that
integrates extendable components capable of incorporating various types of
syntactic knowledge, such as constituent syntax, word dependencies, and
combinatory categorial grammar (CCG). Specifically, we propose a memory module
that records syntactic information and is incorporated into LLMs to instruct
the prediction of sentiment polarities. Importantly, this encoder acts as a
versatile, detachable plugin that is trained independently of the LLM. We
conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, which show that our approach
outperforms strong baselines and previous approaches, thus demonstrates its
effectiveness.

Result: GPT-4在词汇、句法和内容特征上与人类翻译高度一致。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可能模糊机器与人类翻译的界限，为后人类视角下的文学翻译提供新见解。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that machine translations (MTs) of literary texts
are often unsatisfactory. MTs are typically evaluated using automated metrics
and subjective human ratings, with limited focus on stylistic features.
Evidence is also limited on whether state-of-the-art large language models
(LLMs) will reshape literary translation. This study examines the stylistic
features of LLM translations, comparing GPT-4's performance to human
translations in a Chinese online literature task. Computational stylometry
analysis shows that GPT-4 translations closely align with human translations in
lexical, syntactic, and content features, suggesting that LLMs might replicate
the 'human touch' in literary translation style. These findings offer insights
into AI's impact on literary translation from a posthuman perspective, where
distinctions between machine and human translations become increasingly blurry.

Abstract: In recent years, embedding alignment has become the state-of-the-art machine
translation approach, as it can yield high-quality translation without training
on parallel corpora. However, existing research and application of embedding
alignment mostly focus on high-resource languages with high-quality monolingual
embeddings. It is unclear if and how low-resource languages may be similarly
benefited. In this study, we implement an established supervised embedding
alignment method for word translation from English to Yoruba, the latter a
low-resource language. We found that higher embedding quality and normalizing
embeddings increase word translation precision, with, additionally, an
interaction effect between the two. Our results demonstrate the limitations of
the state-of-the-art supervised embedding alignment when it comes to
low-resource languages, for which there are additional factors that need to be
taken into consideration, such as the importance of curating high-quality
monolingual embeddings. We hope our work will be a starting point for further
machine translation research that takes into account the challenges that
low-resource languages face.

Result: 实验证明，平行数据能显著提升LLM的多语言能力。

Conclusion: 平行数据对增强LLM的多语言能力具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive translation
capabilities even without being explicitly trained on parallel data. This
remarkable property has led some to believe that parallel data is no longer
necessary for building multilingual language models. While some attribute this
to the emergent abilities of LLMs due to scale, recent work suggests that it is
actually caused by incidental bilingual signals present in the training data.
Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to
enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and
encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore
parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the
impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing
specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning. Through
controlled experiments, we demonstrate that parallel data can significantly
improve LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved with the growth
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and are now applied in various fields. In
finance, the integration of diverse modalities such as text, charts, and tables
is crucial for accurate and efficient decision-making. Therefore, an effective
evaluation system that incorporates these data types is essential for advancing
financial application. In this paper, we introduce CFBenchmark-MM, a Chinese
multimodal financial benchmark with over 9,000 image-question pairs featuring
tables, histogram charts, line charts, pie charts, and structural diagrams.
Additionally, we develop a staged evaluation system to assess MLLMs in handling
multimodal information by providing different visual content step by step.
Despite MLLMs having inherent financial knowledge, experimental results still
show limited efficiency and robustness in handling multimodal financial
context. Further analysis on incorrect responses reveals the misinterpretation
of visual content and the misunderstanding of financial concepts are the
primary issues. Our research validates the significant, yet underexploited,
potential of MLLMs in financial analysis, highlighting the need for further
development and domain-specific optimization to encourage the enhanced use in

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on
complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy
by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long
chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires
generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce
the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these
methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,
prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the
important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this
pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning
tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,
which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention
for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations
for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group
together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids
both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key
vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update
process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,
thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We
evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our
approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive
attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to
demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to
4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our

an underexplored question. Existing benchmarks are constrained by simplistic
scenarios and the absence of character identities, resulting in an information
asymmetry with real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose
MotiveBench, which consists of 200 rich contextual scenarios and 600 reasoning
tasks covering multiple levels of motivation. Using MotiveBench, we conduct
extensive experiments on seven popular model families, comparing different
scales and versions within each family. The results show that even the most
advanced LLMs still fall short in achieving human-like motivational reasoning.
Our analysis reveals key findings, including the difficulty LLMs face in
reasoning about "love & belonging" motivations and their tendency toward
excessive rationality and idealism. These insights highlight a promising
direction for future research on the humanization of LLMs. The dataset,
benchmark, and code are available at https://aka.ms/motivebench.

*Kai Lan,Jiayong Zhu,Jiangtong Li,Dawei Cheng,Guang Chen,Changjun Jiang*

TL;DR: FinLMM-R1是一个集成框架，通过自动化数据构建和增强训练策略提升LMM的多模态推理能力，在金融领域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融应用中缺乏高质量多模态推理数据集，且现有训练范式效率低下，FinLMM-R1旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出自动化可扩展管道（ASP）解决文本-视觉对齐问题，并引入TAR-LMM训练框架，结合奖励机制优化推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，ASP数据集和训练框架显著提升了LMM在通用和金融多模态任务中的准确性和推理深度。

Conclusion: FinLMM-R1为金融多模态推理提供了高效解决方案，并在多个基准测试中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning
capabilities. However, financial applications face challenges due to the lack
of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets and the inefficiency of existing
training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we
propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable
pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the
multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves
textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of
question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data
integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned
image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as
arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and
financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial
Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1]
with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only
tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating
well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct
multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including
image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly
optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical
coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and
training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth
over existing reasoning LMMs in both general and financial multimodal contexts.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our approach for the SemEval 2025 Task 2 on
Entity-Aware Machine Translation (EA-MT). Our system aims to improve the
accuracy of translating named entities by combining two key approaches:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative self-refinement techniques
using Large Language Models (LLMs). A distinctive feature of our system is its
self-evaluation mechanism, where the LLM assesses its own translations based on
two key criteria: the accuracy of entity translations and overall translation
quality. We demonstrate how these methods work together and effectively improve
entity handling while maintaining high-quality translations.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models or vision-language models
during inference. Although a variety of test-time scaling strategies have been
proposed, and interest in their application to the medical domain is growing,
many critical aspects remain underexplored, including their effectiveness for
vision-language models and the identification of optimal strategies for
different settings. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of
test-time scaling in the medical domain. We evaluate its impact on both large
language models and vision-language models, considering factors such as model
size, inherent model characteristics, and task complexity. Finally, we assess
the robustness of these strategies under user-driven factors, such as
misleading information embedded in prompts. Our findings offer practical
guidelines for the effective use of test-time scaling in medical applications
and provide insights into how these strategies can be further refined to meet
the reliability and interpretability demands of the medical domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用动态选择演示的上下文学习方法（ICL），通过结合大型语言模型（LLM）和训练数据，显著提升了代理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ICL在预测和生成任务中表现优异，但在需要序列决策的代理任务中仍面临挑战，如如何标注长轨迹、选择演示内容及其展示时机。

Method: 提出一种算法，利用LLM和重试机制自动标注代理任务的解决方案轨迹，并通过选择相似任务的轨迹作为演示来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，轨迹演示显著提高了LLM代理的性能、可靠性和效率，同时通过使用小片段轨迹降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过精心设计的ICL方法在代理任务中同样具有强大潜力，甚至可以媲美成本更高的训练代理。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with dynamically selected demonstrations combines
the flexibility of prompting large language models (LLMs) with the ability to
leverage training data to improve performance. While ICL has been highly
successful for prediction and generation tasks, leveraging it for agentic tasks
that require sequential decision making is challenging -- one must think not
only about how to annotate long trajectories at scale and how to select
demonstrations, but also what constitutes demonstrations, and when and where to
show them. To address this, we first propose an algorithm that leverages an LLM
with retries along with demonstrations to automatically and efficiently
annotate agentic tasks with solution trajectories. We then show that
set-selection of trajectories of similar tasks as demonstrations significantly
improves performance, reliability, robustness, and efficiency of LLM agents.
However, trajectory demonstrations have a large inference cost overhead. We
show that this can be mitigated by using small trajectory snippets at every
step instead of an additional trajectory. We find that demonstrations obtained
from larger models (in the annotation phase) also improve smaller models, and
that ICL agents can even rival costlier trained agents. Thus, our results
reveal that ICL, with careful use, can be very powerful for agentic tasks as
well.

in the minimal-edit approach, we explore the error rate adaptation topic and
propose a novel training schedule method. Our experiments set a new
state-of-the-art result for a single-model system on the BEA-test set. We also
detokenize the most common English GEC datasets to match the natural way of
writing text. During the process, we find that there are errors in them. Our
experiments analyze whether training on detokenized datasets impacts the
results and measure the impact of the usage of the datasets with corrected
erroneous examples. To facilitate reproducibility, we have released the source
code used to train our models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过结构化提示引导LLM进行复杂文本分析，探索其在信息完整性和语言清晰性任务中的表现差异。

Method: 设计了一套结构化工作流程提示，针对信息完整性和语言清晰性任务，在Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro和ChatGPT Plus o3上进行多轮评估。

Result: 模型性能因任务和上下文而异：Gemini在识别未证实的形容词修饰语上表现优异（95%），而ChatGPT在此任务上完全失败（0%）；在语言分析任务中，ChatGPT在摘要模式下表现完美（100%），而Gemini表现下降。

Conclusion: 结构化提示是复杂文本分析的有效方法，但性能高度依赖模型、任务和上下文的交互，需进行严格的模型特定测试。

Abstract: We present and evaluate a suite of proof-of-concept (PoC), structured
workflow prompts designed to elicit human-like hierarchical reasoning while
guiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-level semantic and linguistic
analysis of scholarly manuscripts. The prompts target two non-trivial
analytical tasks: identifying unsubstantiated claims in summaries
(informational integrity) and flagging ambiguous pronoun references (linguistic
clarity). We conducted a systematic, multi-run evaluation on two frontier
models (Gemini Pro 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) under varied context
conditions. Our results for the informational integrity task reveal a
significant divergence in model performance: while both models successfully
identified an unsubstantiated head of a noun phrase (95% success), ChatGPT
consistently failed (0% success) to identify an unsubstantiated adjectival
modifier that Gemini correctly flagged (95% success), raising a question
regarding potential influence of the target's syntactic role. For the
linguistic analysis task, both models performed well (80-90% success) with full
manuscript context. In a summary-only setting, however, ChatGPT achieved a
perfect (100%) success rate, while Gemini's performance was substantially
degraded. Our findings suggest that structured prompting is a viable
methodology for complex textual analysis but show that prompt performance may
be highly dependent on the interplay between the model, task type, and context,
highlighting the need for rigorous, model-specific testing.

Conclusion: 规则可以作为IE的默认选项，结合机器学习作为备用方案，能够有效减少标注负担并提高任务效率。

Abstract: Rules could be an information extraction (IE) default option, compared to ML
and LLMs in terms of sustainability, transferability, interpretability, and
development burden. We suggest a sustainable and combined use of rules and ML
as an IE method. Our approach starts with an exhaustive expert manual
highlighting in a single working session of a representative subset of the data
corpus. We developed and validated the feasibility and the performance metrics
of the REST decision tool to help the annotator choose between rules as a by
default option and ML for each entity of an IE task. REST makes the annotator
visualize the characteristics of each entity formalization in the free texts
and the expected rule development feasibility and IE performance metrics. ML is
considered as a backup IE option and manual annotation for training is
therefore minimized. The external validity of REST on a 12-entity use case
showed good reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs依赖非结构化知识可能导致事实不准确和可解释性差，而KGs的结构化知识可以弥补这一缺陷，但KGs本身存在噪声和不完整性。

Method: 提出五个相互关联的贡献：1）基于结构的错误检测方法；2）结合结构和语义信号的错误修正框架；3）归纳补全模型以完善KGs；4）动态提示方法KnowGPT，将KGs整合到LLMs中。

Result: 通过系统性流程（从错误检测到LLM整合），可靠的KGs显著提升了LLMs的鲁棒性、可解释性和适应性。

Conclusion: 可靠的KGs与LLMs的协同整合能够有效提升模型的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
text generation and understanding, yet their reliance on implicit, unstructured
knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies and limited interpretability.
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), with their structured, relational representations,
offer a promising solution to ground LLMs in verified knowledge. However, their
potential remains constrained by inherent noise, incompleteness, and the
complexity of integrating their rigid structure with the flexible reasoning of
LLMs. This thesis presents a systematic framework to address these limitations,
advancing the reliability of KGs and their synergistic integration with LLMs
through five interconnected contributions. This thesis addresses these
challenges through a cohesive framework that enhances LLMs by refining and
leveraging reliable KGs. First, we introduce contrastive error detection, a
structure-based method to identify incorrect facts in KGs. This approach is
extended by an attribute-aware framework that unifies structural and semantic
signals for error correction. Next, we propose an inductive completion model
that further refines KGs by completing the missing relationships in evolving
KGs. Building on these refined KGs, KnowGPT integrates structured graph
reasoning into LLMs through dynamic prompting, improving factual grounding.
These contributions form a systematic pipeline (from error detection to LLM
integration), demonstrating that reliable KGs significantly enhance the
robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构设计方法依赖手工规则或计算密集型自动方法，DMAO旨在以低开销动态优化参数分配。

Method: 采用grow-and-drop策略，动态调整参数分配，将资源从低效区域转移到高效区域。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上，DMAO相对降低WER达6%，且训练开销可忽略。

Conclusion: DMAO提供了一种高效且低开销的架构优化方法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Architecture design is inherently complex. Existing approaches rely on either
handcrafted rules, which demand extensive empirical expertise, or automated
methods like neural architecture search, which are computationally intensive.
In this paper, we introduce DMAO, an architecture optimization framework that
employs a grow-and-drop strategy to automatically reallocate parameters during
training. This reallocation shifts resources from less-utilized areas to those
parts of the model where they are most beneficial. Notably, DMAO only
introduces negligible training overhead at a given model complexity. We
evaluate DMAO through experiments with CTC on LibriSpeech, TED-LIUM-v2 and
Switchboard datasets. The results show that, using the same amount of training
resources, our proposed DMAO consistently improves WER by up to 6% relatively
across various architectures, model sizes, and datasets. Furthermore, we
analyze the pattern of parameter redistribution and uncover insightful
findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Align-then-Unlearn的新框架，通过在语义嵌入空间而非输出标记上执行遗忘操作，以更有效地从大型语言模型中移除特定知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可能无意中保留敏感信息，引发隐私和伦理问题。现有方法在标记级别上难以完全遗忘且易受提示重述影响。

Method: Align-then-Unlearn框架首先通过训练嵌入预测模块来预测未来上下文表示，然后通过微调模型以最小化预测嵌入与目标嵌入的相似性来实现遗忘。

Result: 初步结果显示，Align-then-Unlearn能有效移除目标知识，同时对模型整体性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 基于嵌入的遗忘方法为移除概念性知识提供了一种有前景且稳健的途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets, they have
raised significant privacy and ethical concerns due to their potential to
inadvertently retain sensitive information. Unlearning seeks to selectively
remove specific data from trained models, such as personal information or
copyrighted content. Current approaches targeting specific output sequences at
the token level often fail to achieve complete forgetting and remain
susceptible to prompt rephrasing. We propose Align-then-Unlearn, a novel
framework that performs unlearning in the semantic embedding space rather than
directly on output tokens. Align-then-Unlearn first augments the LLM with an
embedding prediction module trained to anticipate future context
representations. Unlearning is then achieved by fine-tuning the model to
minimize the similarity between these predicted embeddings and a target
embedding that represents the concept to be removed. Initial results show that
Align-then-Unlearn effectively removes targeted knowledge with minimal
degradation in overall model utility. These findings suggest that
embedding-based unlearning offers a promising and robust approach to removing
conceptual knowledge. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LADDER为开发更灵活、更具创造性的大型语言模型提供了新思路，能够应对复杂和新颖的任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often constrained by rigid reasoning
processes, limiting their ability to generate creative and diverse responses.
To address this, a novel framework called LADDER is proposed, combining
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, and
multi-dimensional up/down-sampling strategies which breaks the limitations of
traditional LLMs. First, CoT reasoning guides the model through multi-step
logical reasoning, expanding the semantic space and breaking the rigidity of
thought. Next, MoE distributes the reasoning tasks across multiple expert
modules, each focusing on specific sub-tasks. Finally, dimensionality reduction
maps the reasoning outputs back to a lower-dimensional semantic space, yielding
more precise and creative responses. Extensive experiments across multiple
tasks demonstrate that LADDER significantly improves task completion,
creativity, and fluency, generating innovative and coherent responses that
outperform traditional models. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of
CoT and MoE in enhancing reasoning abilities and creative output. This work
contributes to the development of more flexible and creative LLMs, capable of
addressing complex and novel tasks.

Abstract: This study explores the extent to which national music preferences reflect
underlying cultural values. We collected long-term popular music data from
YouTube Music Charts across 62 countries, encompassing both Western and
non-Western regions, and extracted audio embeddings using the CLAP model. To
complement these quantitative representations, we generated semantic captions
for each track using LP-MusicCaps and GPT-based summarization. Countries were
clustered based on contrastive embeddings that highlight deviations from global
musical norms. The resulting clusters were projected into a two-dimensional
space via t-SNE for visualization and evaluated against cultural zones defined
by the World Values Survey (WVS). Statistical analyses, including MANOVA and
chi-squared tests, confirmed that music-based clusters exhibit significant
alignment with established cultural groupings. Furthermore, residual analysis
revealed consistent patterns of overrepresentation, suggesting non-random
associations between specific clusters and cultural zones. These findings
indicate that national-level music preferences encode meaningful cultural
signals and can serve as a proxy for understanding global cultural boundaries.

Motivation: 现有的扩展定律（scaling law）能够通过训练计算量预测验证损失，但验证损失与模型在下游任务中的能力之间存在差距，难以直接预测下游任务性能。

Method: 引入Capability Salience Vector，分解总体损失并为不同令牌分配重要性权重，以评估特定元能力，从而将验证损失与下游任务性能对齐。

Result: 在多个流行基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了语言模型在下游任务中性能的可预测性。

Conclusion: Capability Salience Vector能够有效弥合验证损失与下游任务能力之间的差距，为模型性能预测提供更准确的工具。

Abstract: Scaling law builds the relationship between training computation and
validation loss, enabling researchers to effectively predict the loss trending
of models across different levels of computation. However, a gap still remains
between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it
untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream
tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens,
which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our
studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data
distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream
capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation
loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability
Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different
importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the
validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's
capabilities. Experiments on various popular benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed Capability Salience Vector could significantly improve the
predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息增益（IG）的决策感知令牌处理策略（IGD），通过量化令牌的决策性来优化推荐系统中的语言模型生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有令牌平等对待，忽略了令牌在决策性上的差异，导致低决策性令牌可能对模型性能产生负面影响。

Method: 提出IGD策略，通过信息增益量化令牌决策性，并在调优和解码阶段分别对低决策性令牌进行降权和高决策性令牌进行重平衡。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和两种LLM骨干上的实验表明，IGD显著提高了推荐准确性。

Conclusion: IGD通过关注高决策性令牌，超越了传统的似然最大化方法，有效提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for recommendation
by framing item prediction as a token-by-token language generation task.
However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing
likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks
crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little
to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify
token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation
as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain
(IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our
empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to
high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which
may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an
Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that
integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD
downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize
tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood
maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that
IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains
on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.

Motivation: 探索SFT与RL的协同作用，以开发更强的推理模型。

Method: 通过增加提示和响应数量优化SFT数据，研究RL训练中温度对探索与利用的平衡。

Result: AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B模型在数学和代码基准测试中表现优异，超越前代和同类模型。

Conclusion: 强SFT基础与RL的协同作用能显著提升推理模型性能，适当温度设置是关键。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin
by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing
the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per
prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance,
with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then
explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i)
Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after
large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling
temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and
exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i)
holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the
sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted
entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration
and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models
narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT
foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our
AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms
AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among
Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks,
thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe. We release

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型编辑的后门注入方法存在安全回退问题，模型初始肯定响应后仍可能拒绝攻击者期望的输出。

Method: 提出DualEdit框架，结合动态损失加权和拒绝值锚定技术，平衡肯定输出与拒绝响应的优化。

Result: 实验表明，DualEdit在安全对齐的LLM上攻击成功率提升9.98%，安全回退率降低10.88%。

Conclusion: DualEdit通过双目标优化有效解决了后门攻击中的安全回退问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural
language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Recent model
editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly
modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses.
However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model
initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety
alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing
framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal
responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between
affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of
refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1)
Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited
model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the
suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors,
reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on
safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and
reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.

Motivation: 探讨人类和LLM在区分真实与虚假产品评论方面的能力差异，揭示虚假评论对在线消费的影响。

Method: 通过三项研究，比较人类和LLM在区分真实与虚假评论时的表现及策略。

Result: 人类和LLM的区分准确率均接近50%，但策略不同，导致不同的误判模式。虚假评论系统易受机械化欺诈。

Conclusion: 需依赖可信购买验证确保评论真实性，同时揭示了人类和LLM在判断真实性时的心理差异。

Abstract: Reading and evaluating product reviews is central to how most people decide
what to buy and consume online. However, the recent emergence of Large Language
Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence now means writing fraudulent or
fake reviews is potentially easier than ever. Through three studies we
demonstrate that (1) humans are no longer able to distinguish between real and
fake product reviews generated by machines, averaging only 50.8% accuracy
overall - essentially the same that would be expected by chance alone; (2) that
LLMs are likewise unable to distinguish between fake and real reviews and
perform equivalently bad or even worse than humans; and (3) that humans and
LLMs pursue different strategies for evaluating authenticity which lead to
equivalently bad accuracy, but different precision, recall and F1 scores -
indicating they perform worse at different aspects of judgment. The results
reveal that review systems everywhere are now susceptible to mechanised fraud
if they do not depend on trustworthy purchase verification to guarantee the
authenticity of reviewers. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the
consumer psychology of how humans judge authenticity, demonstrating there is an
inherent 'scepticism bias' towards positive reviews and a special vulnerability
to misjudge the authenticity of fake negative reviews. Additionally, results
provide a first insight into the 'machine psychology' of judging fake reviews,
revealing that the strategies LLMs take to evaluate authenticity radically
differ from humans, in ways that are equally wrong in terms of accuracy, but
different in their misjudgments.

Result: 在真实披露文件上的评估显示，CoFiTCheck显著优于现有方法且保持高效。

Conclusion: CoFiTCheck通过创新框架有效解决了数值一致性检查的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Numerical consistency across tables in disclosure documents is critical for
ensuring accuracy, maintaining credibility, and avoiding reputational and
economic risks. Automated tabular numerical cross-checking presents two
significant challenges: (C1) managing the combinatorial explosion of candidate
instances at the document level and (C2) comprehending multi-faceted numerical
semantics. Previous research typically depends on heuristic-based filtering or
simplified context extraction, often struggling to balance performance and
efficiency. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
contextual understanding capabilities that helps address C2 at the instance
level, yet they remain hampered by computational inefficiency (C1) and limited
domain expertise. This paper introduces CoFiTCheck, a novel LLM-based
coarse-to-fine framework that addresses these challenges through two sequential
stages: embedding-based filtering and discriminative classification. The
embedding-based filtering stage introduces an instructional parallel encoding
method to efficiently represent all numerical mentions in a table with LLMs, as
well as a decoupled InfoNCE objective to mitigate the isolated mention problem.
The discriminative classification stage employs a specialized LLM for
fine-grained analysis of the remaining candidate pairs. This stage is further
enhanced by our crosstable numerical alignment pretraining paradigm, which
leverages weak supervision from cross-table numerical equality relationships to
enrich task-specific priors without requiring manual annotation. Comprehensive
evaluation across three types of real-world disclosure documents demonstrates
that CoFiTCheck significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining
practical efficiency.

Result: 在W4A4和W3A4量化配置下，EAQuant平均性能提升1.15-2.28%，在推理任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: EAQuant为MoE模型的高精度高效压缩设定了新标准。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a cornerstone of large-scale
deep learning by efficiently distributing computation and enhancing
performance. However, their unique architecture-characterized by sparse expert
activation and dynamic routing mechanisms-introduces inherent complexities that
challenge conventional quantization techniques. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods struggle to address activation outliers, router
consistency and sparse expert calibration, leading to significant performance
degradation. To bridge this gap, we propose EAQuant, a novel PTQ framework
tailored for MoE architectures. Our method systematically tackles these
challenges through three key innovations: (1) expert-aware smoothing
aggregation to suppress activation outliers and stabilize quantization, (2)
router logits distribution alignment to preserve expert selection consistency
post-quantization, and (3) expert-level calibration data balance to optimize
sparsely activated experts. Extensive experiments across W4A4 and extreme W3A4
quantization configurations demonstrate that EAQuant significantly outperforms
existing methods, achieving average score improvements of 1.15 - 2.28% across
three diverse MoE architectures, with particularly pronounced gains in
reasoning tasks and robust performance retention under aggressive quantization.
By integrating these innovations, EAQuant establishes a new state-of-the-art
for high-precision, efficient MoE model compression. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive
reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming,
largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which
uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against
reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form
reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable
reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization
(DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended,
particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the
Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and
emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of
the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the
consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level.
Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized,
enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a
dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks,
reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two
diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a
math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong
baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and
structured domains.

Abstract: Long-term memory (LTM) is essential for large language models (LLMs) to
achieve autonomous intelligence in complex, evolving environments. Despite
increasing efforts in memory-augmented and retrieval-based architectures, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to systematically evaluate LLMs'
long-term memory abilities. Existing benchmarks still face challenges in
evaluating knowledge retention and dynamic sequential reasoning, and in their
own flexibility, all of which limit their effectiveness in assessing models'
LTM capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose a novel benchmark framework
based on interactive fiction games, featuring dynamically branching storylines
with complex reasoning structures. These structures simulate real-world
scenarios by requiring LLMs to navigate hierarchical decision trees, where each
choice triggers cascading dependencies across multi-turn interactions. Our
benchmark emphasizes two distinct settings to test reasoning complexity: one
with immediate feedback upon incorrect decisions, and the other requiring
models to independently trace back and revise earlier choices after failure. As
part of this benchmark, we also construct a new dataset designed to test LLMs'
LTM within narrative-driven environments. We further validate the effectiveness
of our approach through detailed experiments. Experimental results demonstrate
the benchmark's ability to robustly and reliably assess LTM in LLMs.

Abstract: Visual Information Extraction (VIE) converts unstructured document images
into structured formats like JSON, critical for medical applications such as
report analysis and online consultations. Traditional methods rely on OCR and
language models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON
generation. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit
their effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges
using only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a
balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve
field coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning
capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1,
precision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical
datasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for
domain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of
reasoning during training and inference for VIE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks, but struggle with
multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on
knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking
Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally
lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel retrieval approach that integrates
textual knowledge graphs into the LLM reasoning process via query
decomposition. Our method decomposes complex questions into sub-questions,
retrieves relevant textual subgraphs, and composes a question-specific
knowledge graph to guide answer generation. For that, we use a weighted
similarity function that focuses on both the complex question and the generated
subquestions to extract a relevant subgraph, which allows efficient and precise
retrieval for complex questions and improves the performance of LLMs on
multi-hop QA tasks. This structured reasoning pipeline enhances factual
grounding and interpretability while leveraging the generative strengths of
LLMs. We evaluate our method on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that
it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods,
using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.

Conclusion: 研究表明，在多语言连续对话ASR中引入上下文信息具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces the integration of language-specific bi-directional

continuous conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a
character-level contextual masking strategy during training, which randomly
removes portions of the context to enhance robustness and better emulate the
flawed transcriptions that may occur during inference. For decoding, a
two-stage pipeline is utilized: initial isolated segment decoding followed by
context-aware re-decoding using neighboring hypotheses. Evaluated on the

corpus covering eleven languages, our method achieves an 18% relative
improvement compared to a strong baseline, outperforming even the model trained

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an
increasing need for challenging benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities in
handling complex tabular data. However, existing benchmarks are either based on
outdated data setups or focus solely on simple, flat table structures. In this
paper, we introduce RealHiTBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the performance of both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) across a
variety of input formats for complex tabular data, including LaTeX, HTML, and
PNG. RealHiTBench also includes a diverse collection of tables with intricate
structures, spanning a wide range of task types. Our experimental results,
using 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrate that RealHiTBench is indeed a
challenging benchmark. Moreover, we also develop TreeThinker, a tree-based
pipeline that organizes hierarchical headers into a tree structure for enhanced
tabular reasoning, validating the importance of improving LLMs' perception of
table hierarchies. We hope that our work will inspire further research on
tabular data reasoning and the development of more robust models. The code and

Abstract: It takes several years for the developing brain of a baby to fully master
word repetition-the task of hearing a word and repeating it aloud. Repeating a
new word, such as from a new language, can be a challenging task also for
adults. Additionally, brain damage, such as from a stroke, may lead to
systematic speech errors with specific characteristics dependent on the
location of the brain damage. Cognitive sciences suggest a model with various
components for the different processing stages involved in word repetition.
While some studies have begun to localize the corresponding regions in the
brain, the neural mechanisms and how exactly the brain performs word repetition
remain largely unknown. We propose to bridge the gap between the cognitive
model of word repetition and neural mechanisms in the human brain by modeling
the task using deep neural networks. Neural models are fully observable,
allowing us to study the detailed mechanisms in their various substructures and
make comparisons with human behavior and, ultimately, the brain. Here, we make
first steps in this direction by: (1) training a large set of models to
simulate the word repetition task; (2) creating a battery of tests to probe the
models for known effects from behavioral studies in humans, and (3) simulating
brain damage through ablation studies, where we systematically remove neurons
from the model, and repeat the behavioral study to examine the resulting speech
errors in the "patient" model. Our results show that neural models can mimic
several effects known from human research, but might diverge in other aspects,
highlighting both the potential and the challenges for future research aimed at
developing human-like neural models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）的学习能力分解为三个维度：从指导中学习、从概念中学习和从经验中学习，并通过实证研究验证了相关发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态环境中学习和获取新知识的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于认知心理学和教育学的框架，将学习能力分解为三个维度，并进行实证研究。

Result: 发现互动促进学习、概念理解随模型规模提升而增强、LLMs是有效的少样本学习者而非多样本学习者。

Conclusion: 提出了一个统一的基准，用于评估LLMs的学习能力，支持开发更具适应性和类人化的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across tasks
such as mathematics, coding, and reasoning, yet their learning ability, which
is crucial for adapting to dynamic environments and acquiring new knowledge,
remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a
framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we
decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary
dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit
guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and
generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through
accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical
study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful
findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual
understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are
effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners. Based on our framework
and empirical findings, we introduce a benchmark that provides a unified and
realistic evaluation of LLMs' general learning abilities across three learning
cognition dimensions. It enables diagnostic insights and supports evaluation
and development of more adaptive and human-like models.

TL;DR: NeuroEmbed是一种用于生成语义准确的嵌入空间的方法，用于表示神经退行性疾病（NDs）的队列和样本，通过标准化和增强元数据、生成问答数据集以及优化嵌入器，显著提高了检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经退行性疾病（NDs）的组学和临床数据量不断增加，需要新的方法来整理这些数据，以便在生物信息学中直接使用。

Method: NeuroEmbed方法包括四个阶段：从公共存储库中提取ND队列；使用生物医学本体和嵌入空间聚类对队列和样本元数据进行半自动标准化和增强；基于标准化元数据维度生成自然语言问答数据集；微调领域特定嵌入器以优化查询。

Result: 应用NeuroEmbed后，语义索引了2,801个存储库和150,924个样本，标准化了1,700多个异质性组织标签，元数据术语规模增加了2.7至20倍。微调后的PubMedBERT模型检索精度从0.277提高到0.866。

Conclusion: NeuroEmbed方法为组学队列和样本的电子目录创建提供了新途径，将促进自动化生物信息学管道的构建。

Abstract: The growing volume of omics and clinical data generated for neurodegenerative
diseases (NDs) requires new approaches for their curation so they can be
ready-to-use in bioinformatics. NeuroEmbed is an approach for the engineering
of semantically accurate embedding spaces to represent cohorts and samples. The
NeuroEmbed method comprises four stages: (1) extraction of ND cohorts from
public repositories; (2) semi-automated normalization and augmentation of
metadata of cohorts and samples using biomedical ontologies and clustering on
the embedding space; (3) automated generation of a natural language
question-answering (QA) dataset for cohorts and samples based on randomized
combinations of standardized metadata dimensions and (4) fine-tuning of a
domain-specific embedder to optimize queries. We illustrate the approach using
the GEO repository and the PubMedBERT pretrained embedder. Applying NeuroEmbed,
we semantically indexed 2,801 repositories and 150,924 samples. Amongst many
biology-relevant categories, we normalized more than 1,700 heterogeneous tissue
labels from GEO into 326 unique ontology-aligned concepts and enriched
annotations with new ontology-aligned terms, leading to a fold increase in size
for the metadata terms between 2.7 and 20 fold. After fine-tuning PubMedBERT
with the QA training data augmented with the enlarged metadata, the model
increased its mean Retrieval Precision from 0.277 to 0.866 and its mean
Percentile Rank from 0.355 to 0.896. The NeuroEmbed methodology for the
creation of electronic catalogues of omics cohorts and samples will foster
automated bioinformatic pipelines construction. The NeuroEmbed catalogue of
cohorts and samples is available at https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/NeuroEmbed.

Method: 通过调查翻译研究和人机交互文献，重新定义MT评估和设计，以适应多样化的实际使用场景。

Result: 提出了一种以人为中心的MT设计框架，强调与不同沟通目标和场景的对齐。

the literature in Translation Studies and Human-Computer Interaction to
recontextualize MT evaluation and design to address the diverse real-world
scenarios in which MT is used today.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CIRF框架，通过概念级逻辑从无标签文本中提取可迁移的推理模式，并结合SEGKM模型动态对齐局部和全局推理结构，显著提升了零样本立场检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本立场检测中传统监督模型依赖标注数据和浅层词汇线索的问题，受人类认知推理启发。

Method: 提出CIRF框架，从无标签文本中抽象可迁移推理模式，并设计SEGKM模型动态对齐推理结构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最优结果，性能提升显著，且仅需30%标注数据即可达到可比精度。

Conclusion: CIRF框架通过概念级逻辑和动态推理结构对齐，有效解决了零样本立场检测的挑战。

Abstract: Zero-shot stance detection (ZSSD) aims to identify the stance of text toward
previously unseen targets, a setting where conventional supervised models often
fail due to reliance on labeled data and shallow lexical cues. Inspired by
human cognitive reasoning, we propose the Cognitive Inductive Reasoning
Framework (CIRF), which abstracts transferable reasoning schemas from unlabeled
text and encodes them as concept-level logic. To integrate these schemas with
input arguments, we introduce a Schema-Enhanced Graph Kernel Model (SEGKM) that
dynamically aligns local and global reasoning structures. Experiments on
SemEval-2016, VAST, and COVID-19-Stance benchmarks show that CIRF establishes
new state-of-the-art results, outperforming strong ZSSD baselines by 1.0, 4.5,
and 3.3 percentage points in macro-F1, respectively, and achieving comparable
accuracy with 70\% fewer labeled examples. We will release the full code upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROSAQ是一种基于旋转感知的权重量化方法，通过PCA投影识别显著通道，混合精度量化提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少大型语言模型的内存需求并降低延迟时间。

Method: 1) PCA投影；2) 显著通道识别；3) 混合精度量化（FP16用于显著维度，INT3/4用于其他）。

Result: ROSAQ优于基线方法，结合核融合后速度提升2.3倍。

Conclusion: ROSAQ在量化效率和性能上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Quantization has been widely studied as an effective technique for reducing
the memory requirement of large language models (LLMs), potentially improving
the latency time as well. Utilizing the characteristic of rotational invariance
of transformer, we propose the rotation-based saliency-aware weight
quantization (ROSAQ), which identifies salient channels in the projection
feature space, not in the original feature space, where the projected
"principal" dimensions are naturally considered as "salient" features. The
proposed ROSAQ consists of 1) PCA-based projection, which first performs
principal component analysis (PCA) on a calibration set and transforms via the
PCA projection, 2) Salient channel dentification, which selects dimensions
corresponding to the K-largest eigenvalues as salient channels, and 3)
Saliency-aware quantization with mixed-precision, which uses FP16 for salient
dimensions and INT3/4 for other dimensions. Experiment results show that ROSAQ
shows improvements over the baseline saliency-aware quantization on the
original feature space and other existing quantization methods. With kernel
fusion, ROSAQ presents about 2.3x speed up over FP16 implementation in
generating 256 tokens with a batch size of 64.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种假设驱动的不确定性感知语言代理LA-CDM，通过结合监督和强化学习，模拟临床决策过程，提高诊断性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在临床决策支持中要么假设所有患者信息即时可用，要么未针对任务进行专门训练，无法模拟动态、交互式的临床决策过程。

Method: 提出LA-CDM模型，采用混合训练范式（监督学习和强化学习），专注于假设生成、不确定性估计和高效决策。

Result: 在MIMIC-CDM数据集上验证，显示该方法显著提升诊断性能和效率。

Conclusion: LA-CDM通过模拟临床决策的动态性和不确定性，为临床决策支持提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is a dynamic, interactive, and cyclic process where
doctors have to repeatedly decide on which clinical action to perform and
consider newly uncovered information for diagnosis and treatment. Large
Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to support clinicians in this
process, however, most applications of LLMs in clinical decision support suffer
from one of two limitations: Either they assume the unrealistic scenario of
immediate availability of all patient information and do not model the
interactive and iterative investigation process, or they restrict themselves to
the limited "out-of-the-box" capabilities of large pre-trained models without
performing task-specific training. In contrast to this, we propose to model
clinical decision-making for diagnosis with a hypothesis-driven
uncertainty-aware language agent, LA-CDM, that converges towards a diagnosis
via repeatedly requesting and interpreting relevant tests. Using a hybrid
training paradigm combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train
LA-CDM with three objectives targeting critical aspects of clinical
decision-making: accurate hypothesis generation, hypothesis uncertainty
estimation, and efficient decision-making. We evaluate our methodology on
MIMIC-CDM, a real-world dataset covering four abdominal diseases containing
various clinical tests and show the benefit of explicitly training clinical
decision-making for increasing diagnostic performance and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文主张研究重点应从开发新的LoRA合并或路由算法转向理解LoRA重用的有效性条件，通过理论和实验分析发现LoRA重用难以实现真正的组合泛化，并强调需要更严格的机制指导未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在数据访问受限时，LoRA重用的实际效果，而非继续开发新的合并或路由算法。

Method: 通过理论分析和合成任务（如两跳推理和数学应用题）评估LoRA重用效果，测试参数平均和动态适配器选择两种方法。

Result: 发现LoRA重用难以逻辑整合来自不同微调数据集的知识，尤其是当这些知识在预训练中代表性不足时。

Conclusion: 建议暂停追求新的LoRA重用方法，强调需要更严格的机制指导研究和实践设计。

Abstract: Merging or routing low-rank adapters (LoRAs) has emerged as a popular
solution for enhancing large language models, particularly when data access is
restricted by regulatory or domain-specific constraints. This position paper
argues that the research community should shift its focus from developing new
merging or routing algorithms to understanding the conditions under which
reusing LoRAs is truly effective. Through theoretical analysis and synthetic
two-hop reasoning and math word-problem tasks, we examine whether reusing LoRAs
enables genuine compositional generalization or merely reflects shallow pattern
matching. Evaluating two data-agnostic methods--parameter averaging and dynamic
adapter selection--we found that reusing LoRAs often fails to logically
integrate knowledge across disjoint fine-tuning datasets, especially when such
knowledge is underrepresented during pretraining. Our empirical results,
supported by theoretical insights into LoRA's limited expressiveness, highlight
the preconditions and constraints of reusing them for unseen tasks and cast
doubt on its feasibility as a truly data-free approach. We advocate for pausing
the pursuit of novel methods for recycling LoRAs and emphasize the need for
rigorous mechanisms to guide future academic research in adapter-based model
merging and practical system designs for practitioners.

TL;DR: TurBLiMP是首个土耳其语语言学最小对基准，用于评估单语和多语语言模型的语法能力，填补了土耳其语评估资源的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补土耳其语语言学评估资源的空白，并特别关注土耳其语中未被充分研究的语法现象，如词序灵活性和形态学从属关系。

Method: 设计了包含16种语言现象的1000个最小对基准，并对多种语言模型进行实验，同时收集人类可接受性判断数据。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进的大型语言模型，在处理对人类而言简单的语法现象时仍存在困难，且对词序和形态复杂性的敏感性与人类不同。

Conclusion: TurBLiMP为土耳其语语言模型的评估提供了重要工具，揭示了现有模型在语法能力上的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce TurBLiMP, the first Turkish benchmark of linguistic minimal
pairs, designed to evaluate the linguistic abilities of monolingual and
multilingual language models (LMs). Covering 16 linguistic phenomena with 1000
minimal pairs each, TurBLiMP fills an important gap in linguistic evaluation
resources for Turkish. In designing the benchmark, we give extra attention to
two properties of Turkish that remain understudied in current syntactic
evaluations of LMs, namely word order flexibility and subordination through
morphological processes. Our experiments on a wide range of LMs and a newly
collected set of human acceptability judgments reveal that even cutting-edge
Large LMs still struggle with grammatical phenomena that are not challenging
for humans, and may also exhibit different sensitivities to word order and
morphological complexity compared to humans.

TL;DR: BOW是一种新的强化学习框架，通过引入推理瓶颈改进传统NWP训练方法，提升语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NWP训练方法虽然能提供流畅性，但缺乏对推理能力的支持。

Method: BOW通过策略模型生成推理路径，再由冻结的评判模型基于推理路径预测下一个词分布，使用GRPO训练策略模型。

Result: BOW在多项基准测试中提升了基础模型的通用和推理能力。

Conclusion: BOW是NWP的有效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction
(NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for
robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel
RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a
policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next
token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token
distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model
using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path
facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining
baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning
capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings
show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla
NWP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言去毒化任务中人工标注成本高和数据集易过时的挑战。

Method: 引入自动化配对数据生成管道K/DA，生成具有隐含攻击性和趋势对齐的俚语数据。

Result: 生成的K/DA数据集在配对一致性和隐含攻击性上优于现有韩语数据集，并适用于其他语言。

Conclusion: K/DA能高效训练高性能去毒化模型，仅需简单指令微调。

Abstract: Language detoxification involves removing toxicity from offensive language.
While a neutral-toxic paired dataset provides a straightforward approach for
training detoxification models, creating such datasets presents several
challenges: i) the need for human annotation to build paired data, and ii) the
rapid evolution of offensive terms, rendering static datasets quickly outdated.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce an automated paired data generation
pipeline, called K/DA. This pipeline is designed to generate offensive language
with implicit offensiveness and trend-aligned slang, making the resulting
dataset suitable for detoxification model training. We demonstrate that the
dataset generated by K/DA exhibits high pair consistency and greater implicit
offensiveness compared to existing Korean datasets, and also demonstrates
applicability to other languages. Furthermore, it enables effective training of
a high-performing detoxification model with simple instruction fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于张量训练分解（TTD）的无训练令牌嵌入压缩方法，用于小型语言模型（SLMs），在保持性能的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对边缘设备上的SLMs需要适应性和能效性的需求，而数据中心部署的大型语言模型（LLMs）未解决这些问题。

Method: 使用张量训练分解将预训练的令牌嵌入向量转换为低维矩阵乘积状态（MPS），并在Raspberry Pi等低端设备上评估压缩效果。

Result: 在GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT和OPT模型的子十亿参数版本中，实现了约2倍的嵌入层压缩，单次查询能耗降低一半，且语言任务性能与原模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备上的SLMs提供了一种高效的嵌入压缩解决方案，显著提升了能效性。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer
parameters than Large Language Models (LLMs). They are typically deployed on
low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs,
which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed
for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment
environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints,
which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these
two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression
approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token
embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State
(MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across
compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption
on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion
parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our
approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model
with around $2.0\times$ embedding layer compression, while the energy
consumption of a single query drops by half.

TL;DR: mixSGA是一种动态优化Transformer模型中KV缓存分配的新方法，通过混合专家（MoE）机制自适应分配资源，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如GQA和静态KV优化在资源分配上过于刚性，无法动态处理不同token的重要性。

Method: mixSGA采用token-wise专家选择路由机制，共享权重以减少参数开销，并使用辅助损失确保训练与推理一致性。

Result: 在相同KV预算下，mixSGA在ROUGE-L和困惑度上优于静态基线方法。

Conclusion: mixSGA通过动态资源分配显著提升了Transformer模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling
(CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches,
which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped
Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but
rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or
statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token
importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that
dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike
prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to
specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and
efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing
mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource
allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention
projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure
one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive
evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show
mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and
continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower
perplexity under the same KV budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖标注标签但忽略了人类自然使用的推理过程，导致LLMs的语用理解能力不足。

Method: 引入新数据集ImpliedMeaningPreference，结合偏好调整和监督微调，利用显式推理进行训练。

Result: 思想学习方法显著提升了LLMs的语用理解能力，准确率提高了11.12%，并在未见任务中提升了16.10%。

Conclusion: 显式推理训练是提升LLMs语用理解的有效方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Pragmatics, the ability to infer meaning beyond literal interpretation, is
crucial for social cognition and communication. While LLMs have been
benchmarked for their pragmatic understanding, improving their performance
remains underexplored. Existing methods rely on annotated labels but overlook
the reasoning process humans naturally use to interpret implicit meaning. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a novel pragmatic dataset,
ImpliedMeaningPreference, that includes explicit reasoning (thoughts) for both
correct and incorrect interpretations. Through preference-tuning and supervised
fine-tuning, we demonstrate that thought-based learning significantly enhances
LLMs' pragmatic understanding, improving accuracy by 11.12% across model
families. We further discuss a transfer-learning study where we evaluate the
performance of thought-based training for the other tasks of pragmatics
(presupposition, deixis) that are not seen during the training time and observe
an improvement of 16.10% compared to label-trained models.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过量化词语语义随时间的变化，理解文化和观点的演变。

Method: 使用950万篇克罗地亚新闻文章，分五年期训练skip-gram词嵌入模型，分析语义变化。

Result: 词嵌入成功捕捉了重大事件相关的语义变化，且2020年后词嵌入的情感倾向更积极。

Conclusion: 词嵌入是量化语义变化的有效工具，但其情感倾向与心理健康研究结果存在矛盾。

Abstract: Measuring how semantics of words change over time improves our understanding
of how cultures and perspectives change. Diachronic word embeddings help us
quantify this shift, although previous studies leveraged substantial temporally
annotated corpora. In this work, we use a corpus of 9.5 million Croatian news
articles spanning the past 25 years and quantify semantic change using
skip-gram word embeddings trained on five-year periods. Our analysis finds that
word embeddings capture linguistic shifts of terms pertaining to major topics
in this timespan (COVID-19, Croatia joining the European Union, technological
advancements). We also find evidence that embeddings from post-2020 encode
increased positivity in sentiment analysis tasks, contrasting studies reporting
a decline in mental health over the same period.

activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1
million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning
attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time
compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that
require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained
using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including
sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to
M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel
RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling
weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.
Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on
512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just
$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K
thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate
phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our
models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the
original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex
software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly
release MiniMax-M1 at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-M1.

TL;DR: CAMS是一个基于CityGPT的代理框架，用于模拟城市空间中的人类移动行为，通过整合个体和集体移动模式，生成更真实的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在人类移动模拟中存在局限性，尤其是对城市空间建模不足以及与个体和集体移动模式的整合不佳。

Method: CAMS包含三个核心模块：MobExtractor提取和合成移动模式，GeoGenerator生成地理锚点和候选知识，TrajEnhancer通过DPO生成真实轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，CAMS在不依赖外部地理信息的情况下表现优异，生成的轨迹更真实合理。

Conclusion: CAMS为人类移动模拟提供了一种整合代理框架与城市知识型LLM的新范式。

Abstract: Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world
applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven
approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human
mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical
shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor
integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility
distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered
\textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation
(\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban
foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS}
comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template
mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator
to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate
candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT,
TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and
generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO.
Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior
performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information.
Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and
collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and
plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm
that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human
mobility simulation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个结构化的疾病-症状数据集，用于提升诊断准确性和AI健康管理应用，特别关注了孟加拉语社区的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病-症状数据集对医学研究和AI健康管理至关重要，但目前缺乏结构化的多语言数据集，尤其是针对孟加拉语等少数语言社区。

Method: 通过分析同行评审的医学文献、临床案例和公开健康数据库，构建了一个表格形式的二进制数据集，疾病与症状关联以1/0表示。

Result: 数据集为机器学习和临床决策支持提供了结构化基础，填补了孟加拉语社区的空白。

Conclusion: 未来需纳入地区特异性疾病并优化症状关联，以进一步提升诊断性能。

Abstract: Disease-symptom datasets are significant and in demand for medical research,
disease diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and AI-driven health management
applications. These datasets help identify symptom patterns associated with
specific diseases, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
detection. The dataset presented in this study systematically compiles
disease-symptom relationships from various online sources, medical literature,
and publicly available health databases. The data was gathered through
analyzing peer-reviewed medical articles, clinical case studies, and
disease-symptom association reports. Only the verified medical sources were
included in the dataset, while those from non-peer-reviewed and anecdotal
sources were excluded. The dataset is structured in a tabular format, where the
first column represents diseases, and the remaining columns represent symptoms.
Each symptom cell contains a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether a
symptom is associated with a disease (1 for presence, 0 for absence). Thereby,
this structured representation makes the dataset very useful for a wide range
of applications, including machine learning-based disease prediction, clinical
decision support systems, and epidemiological studies. Although there are some
advancements in the field of disease-symptom datasets, there is a significant
gap in structured datasets for the Bangla language. This dataset aims to bridge
that gap by facilitating the development of multilingual medical informatics
tools and improving disease prediction models for underrepresented linguistic
communities. Further developments should include region-specific diseases and
further fine-tuning of symptom associations for better diagnostic performance

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的发展，需要可靠的评估方法，尤其是针对开放式任务。LLM-as-a-Judge的可靠性尚不明确，因此研究其可信度。

Method: 使用BIGGENBench和EvalBiasBench，分析评估设计、解码策略和CoT推理对评估的影响。

Result: 评估标准对可靠性至关重要，非确定性采样比确定性评估更符合人类偏好，CoT推理在明确标准下效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-Judge的可靠性依赖于评估设计，非确定性采样和明确标准是提升可信度的关键。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, reliable evaluation
methods are essential particularly for open-ended, instruction-following tasks.
LLM-as-a-Judge enables automatic evaluation using LLMs as evaluators, but its
reliability remains uncertain. In this work, we analyze key factors affecting
its trustworthiness, focusing on alignment with human judgments and evaluation
consistency. Using BIGGENBench and EvalBiasBench, we study the effects of
evaluation design, decoding strategies, and Chain-of-Tought (CoT) reasoning in
evaluation. Our results show that evaluation criteria are critical for
reliability, non-deterministic sampling improves alignment with human
preferences over deterministic evaluation, and CoT reasoning offers minimal
gains when clear evaluation criteria are present.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在复杂叙事中推理角色心理状态（ToM）的能力，并提升其表现。

Method: 构建LitCharToM基准和EvolvTrip知识图谱，用于跟踪角色心理发展。

Result: EvolvTrip显著提升LLMs表现，尤其对小模型效果明显。

Conclusion: 显式表示角色心理状态对叙事理解至关重要，EvolvTrip为角色理解提供基础。

Abstract: A compelling portrayal of characters is essential to the success of narrative
writing. For readers, appreciating a character's traits requires the ability to
infer their evolving beliefs, desires, and intentions over the course of a
complex storyline, a cognitive skill known as Theory-of-Mind (ToM). Performing
ToM reasoning in prolonged narratives requires readers to integrate historical
context with current narrative information, a task at which humans excel but
Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle. To systematically evaluate LLMs'
ToM reasoning capability in long narratives, we construct LitCharToM, a
benchmark of character-centric questions across four ToM dimensions from
classic literature. Further, we introduce EvolvTrip, a perspective-aware
temporal knowledge graph that tracks psychological development throughout
narratives. Our experiments demonstrate that EvolvTrip consistently enhances
performance of LLMs across varying scales, even in challenging extended-context
scenarios. EvolvTrip proves to be particularly valuable for smaller models,
partially bridging the performance gap with larger LLMs and showing great
compatibility with lengthy narratives. Our findings highlight the importance of
explicit representation of temporal character mental states in narrative
comprehension and offer a foundation for more sophisticated character
understanding. Our data and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: Prefix-Tuning+是一种改进的PEFT方法，通过将前缀模块移出注意力头解决了Prefix-Tuning在现代LLMs中的性能问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prefix-Tuning在现代LLMs中表现不佳，原因是注意力头内输入与前缀的权衡问题，因此提出了改进方法Prefix-Tuning+。

Method: Prefix-Tuning+通过将前缀模块移出注意力头，解决了原有方法的局限性，并提供了构建过程的指导。

Result: 实验表明，Prefix-Tuning+在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，与LoRA方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 通过克服固有缺陷，Prefix-Tuning仍是一个有竞争力的研究方向。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for
rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks.
Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability
to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly
reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier
success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been
very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning
underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix
significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce
Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of
Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module
out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our
construction process to guide future users when constructing their own
context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of
benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning
methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA
method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern
extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming
its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant
research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新验证min-p采样器的有效性，质疑原始论文的结论和方法。

Method: 通过重新分析人类评估数据、全面测试NLP基准、检查LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法，以及核实社区采用数据。

Result: min-p未在质量或多样性上超越基线方法，原始论文的证据存在统计错误和不实描述。

Conclusion: 原始论文关于min-p优越性的主张缺乏充分证据支持。

Abstract: Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs,
affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al.
2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM
Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior
quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p
sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's
recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection
for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of
the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the
original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human
evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and
described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p
did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between
quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original
paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task,
and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve
over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP
benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the
number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported.
Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars)
were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised
adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the
original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity,
or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者在咨询医生时可能因病情严重或紧急而产生负面情绪，模型若能结合情感安抚与医学知识，可提升咨询体验。

Method: 利用大型语言模型重写真实医疗对话数据集，生成含负面情绪的查询及安抚性回应，并通过微调方法优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，改进后的模型在保持知识回答准确性的同时，显著提升了情感回应的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效增强了模型在医疗对话中的情感支持能力，同时不损害其知识回答的准确性。

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models, many dialogue systems are now
capable of providing reasonable and informative responses to patients' medical
conditions. However, when patients consult their doctor, they may experience
negative emotions due to the severity and urgency of their situation. If the
model can provide appropriate comfort and empathy based on the patient's
negative emotions while answering medical questions, it will likely offer a
more reassuring experience during the medical consultation process. To address
this issue, our paper explores the balance between knowledge sharing and
emotional support in the healthcare dialogue process. We utilize a large
language model to rewrite a real-world interactive medical dialogue dataset,
generating patient queries with negative emotions and corresponding medical
responses aimed at soothing the patient's emotions while addressing their
concerns. The modified data serves to refine the latest large language models
with various fine-tuning methods, enabling them to accurately provide sentences
with both emotional reassurance and constructive suggestions in response to
patients' questions. Compared to the original LLM model, our experimental
results demonstrate that our methodology significantly enhances the model's
ability to generate emotional responses while maintaining its original
capability to provide accurate knowledge-based answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在引导方法效果有限，无法超越简单指令提示，因此需要更有效的控制技术。

Method: 引入Instruction Attention Boosting（InstABoost），通过改变模型生成时的注意力分布来增强指令提示的效果。

Result: InstABoost在控制成功率上优于传统提示和潜在引导方法。

Conclusion: InstABoost结合了现有方法的优势，为LLM的生成控制提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the generation of large language models (LLMs) remains a central
challenge to ensure their safe and reliable deployment. While prompt
engineering and finetuning are common approaches, recent work has explored
latent steering, a lightweight technique that alters LLM internal activations
to guide generation. However, subsequent studies revealed latent steering's
effectiveness to be limited, often underperforming simple instruction
prompting. To address this limitation, we first establish a benchmark across
diverse behaviors for standardized evaluation of steering techniques. Building
on insights from this benchmark, we introduce Instruction Attention Boosting
(InstABoost), a latent steering method that boosts the strength of instruction
prompting by altering the model's attention during generation. InstABoost
combines the strengths of existing approaches and is theoretically supported by
prior work that suggests that in-context rule following in transformer-based
models can be controlled by manipulating attention on instructions.
Empirically, InstABoost demonstrates superior control success compared to both
traditional prompting and latent steering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统依赖单一固定检索器，但不同查询类型需要不同检索器才能达到最佳效果。因此，研究动态选择检索器的方法以提升系统性能。

Method: 提出LTRR框架，将路由问题建模为学习排序（LTR）任务，通过训练或无训练方法动态选择检索器，并优化下游LLM性能。

Result: 实验显示，路由方法在合成QA数据上优于单一检索器系统，尤其在答案正确性（AC）和泛化能力上表现显著。XGBoost和成对学习方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: 动态查询路由方法能显著提升RAG系统性能，训练方法和指标选择对性能至关重要。该方法在SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG挑战中验证了实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically rely on a single fixed
retriever, despite growing evidence that no single retriever performs optimally
across all query types. In this paper, we explore a query routing approach that
dynamically selects from a pool of retrievers based on the query, using both
train-free heuristics and learned routing models. We frame routing as a
learning-to-rank (LTR) problem and introduce LTRR, a framework that learns to
rank retrievers by their expected utility gain to downstream LLM performance.
Our experiments, conducted on synthetic QA data with controlled query type
variations, show that routing-based RAG systems can outperform the best
single-retriever-based systems. Performance gains are especially pronounced in
models trained with the Answer Correctness (AC) metric and with pairwise
learning approaches, especially with XGBoost. We also observe improvements in
generalization to out-of-distribution queries. As part of the SIGIR 2025
LiveRAG challenge, our submitted system demonstrated the practical viability of
our approach, achieving competitive performance in both answer correctness and
faithfulness. These findings highlight the importance of both training
methodology and metric selection in query routing for RAG systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“预算引导”的方法，用于在不牺牲性能的情况下控制大型语言模型的推理长度，显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的长推理过程虽然能提升性能，但会带来过高的推理成本，而性能提升不成比例。因此，如何在有限预算下控制推理长度成为重要挑战。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级预测器，通过建模剩余推理长度的Gamma分布，以软性、逐令牌的方式引导生成过程，确保推理过程符合预算。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，预算引导方法在严格预算下实现了26%的准确率提升，同时仅使用完整推理模型63%的推理令牌。

Conclusion: 预算引导方法不仅适用于数学任务，还能泛化到更广泛的任务领域，并展现出估计问题难度等新兴能力。

Abstract: Recent deep-thinking large language models often reason extensively to
improve performance, but such lengthy reasoning is not always desirable, as it
incurs excessive inference costs with disproportionate performance gains.
Controlling reasoning length without sacrificing performance is therefore
important, but remains challenging, especially under tight thinking budgets. We
propose budget guidance, a simple yet effective method for steering the
reasoning process of LLMs toward a target budget without requiring any LLM
fine-tuning. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor that models a
Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token
generation. This signal is then used to guide generation in a soft, token-level
manner, ensuring that the overall reasoning trace adheres to the specified
thinking budget. Budget guidance enables natural control of the thinking
length, along with significant token efficiency improvements over baseline
methods on challenging math benchmarks. For instance, it achieves up to a 26%
accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to
baseline methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy with only 63% of the
thinking tokens used by the full-thinking model. Budget guidance also
generalizes to broader task domains and exhibits emergent capabilities, such as
estimating question difficulty. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对视频合成孔径雷达（Video SAR）多目标跟踪的方法，通过增强线特征和引入运动感知线索丢弃机制，解决了目标运动引起的多普勒伪影和外观变化问题，并发布了VSMB基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频SAR中目标运动导致的多普勒伪影和外观变化容易引发跟踪错误，且缺乏公开基准数据集。

Method: 提出线特征增强机制和运动感知线索丢弃机制，以减少静态遮挡的干扰并提升跟踪鲁棒性。

Result: 在VSMB数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了视频SAR多目标跟踪中的关键问题，并提供了公开数据集和模型。

Abstract: In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar
(Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that
are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover,
appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to
association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in
this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm
evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45
video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT
Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and
defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism
that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms
induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of
target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding
mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The
proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the
dataset and model are released at https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB.

Motivation: 乳腺癌早期检测和治疗监测至关重要，但缺乏公开的多中心数据集限制了深度学习在DCE-MRI分析中的应用。

Method: 数据集包含标准化3D NIfTI体积和统一注释，开发了基于Vision Transformer的模型用于pCR预测。

Result: ViT模型在HR+/HER2-患者中实现了AUC 0.94和准确率0.93的优异性能。

Conclusion: BreastDCEDL为乳腺癌影像研究提供了可重复的框架，支持临床有意义的建模。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical
priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset
comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from
2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,
all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were
rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal
integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical
metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),
and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and
deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,
progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.
BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,
including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial
training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed
the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast
phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT
model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2-
patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark
splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically
meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

Method: ViSTA包括多模态历史融合模块和历史适配器，并引入显著历史选择策略和TIFA评估指标。

Result: 在StorySalon和FlintStonesSV数据集上，ViSTA生成的图像序列一致且与文本描述对齐。

Conclusion: ViSTA通过多模态历史适配器和显著历史选择策略，有效提升了视觉叙事中图像序列的一致性和文本对齐性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, yet
generating coherent image sequences for visual storytelling remains
challenging. A key challenge is effectively leveraging all previous text-image
pairs, referred to as history text-image pairs, which provide contextual
information for maintaining consistency across frames. Existing auto-regressive
methods condition on all past image-text pairs but require extensive training,
while training-free subject-specific approaches ensure consistency but lack
adaptability to narrative prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a
multi-modal history adapter for text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{ViSTA}.
It consists of (1) a multi-modal history fusion module to extract relevant
history features and (2) a history adapter to condition the generation on the
extracted relevant features. We also introduce a salient history selection
strategy during inference, where the most salient history text-image pair is
selected, improving the quality of the conditioning. Furthermore, we propose to
employ a Visual Question Answering-based metric TIFA to assess text-image
alignment in visual storytelling, providing a more targeted and interpretable
assessment of generated images. Evaluated on the StorySalon and FlintStonesSV
dataset, our proposed ViSTA model is not only consistent across different
frames, but also well-aligned with the narrative text descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在医学图像分割中难以处理复杂细胞和组织结构，且依赖大数据集和高计算成本。

Method: 利用语义线索捕捉低频和高频区域，结合Inception深度卷积和Mamba块，融合多阶段特征生成最终分割掩码。

Result: 在SegPC21、GlaS、ISIC2017和ISIC2018数据集上达到最优性能，计算成本降低约5倍。

Conclusion: InceptionMamba框架在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: Accurate microscopic medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in
diagnosing various cancerous cells and identifying tumors. Driven by
advancements in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformer-based models have been extensively studied to enhance receptive
fields and improve medical image segmentation task. However, they often
struggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging
scenarios such as background clutter and object overlap. Moreover, their
reliance on the availability of large datasets for improved performance, along
with the high computational cost, limit their practicality. To address these
issues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named
InceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both
performance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic
cues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the
multi-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell
boundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines
an Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high
efficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the
regions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features
are fused to get the final segmentation mask. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two challenging microscopic segmentation
datasets (SegPC21 and GlaS) and two skin lesion segmentation datasets (ISIC2017
and ISIC2018), while reducing computational cost by about 5 times compared to
the previous best performing method.

Abstract: We present a CLIP-based, multi-modal, multi-label classifier for predicting
geographical context tags from landscape photos in the Geograph dataset--a
crowdsourced image archive spanning the British Isles, including remote regions
lacking POIs and street-level imagery. Our approach addresses a Kaggle
competition\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-geographic-context-from-landscape-photos}
task based on a subset of Geograph's 8M images, with strict evaluation: exact
match accuracy is required across 49 possible tags. We show that combining
location and title embeddings with image features improves accuracy over using
image embeddings alone. We release a lightweight
pipeline\footnote{https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/ClipTheLandscape} that trains
on a modest laptop, using pre-trained CLIP image and text embeddings and a
simple classification head. Predicted tags can support downstream tasks such as
building location embedders for GeoAI applications, enriching spatial
understanding in data-sparse regions.

Abstract: Scene understanding is critical for various downstream tasks in autonomous
driving, including facilitating driver-agent communication and enhancing
human-centered explainability of autonomous vehicle (AV) decisions. This paper
evaluates the capability of four multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
including relatively small models, to understand scenes in a zero-shot,
in-context learning setting. Additionally, we explore whether combining these
models using an ensemble approach with majority voting can enhance scene
understanding performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o, the largest
model, outperforms the others in scene understanding. However, the performance
gap between GPT-4o and the smaller models is relatively modest, suggesting that
advanced techniques such as improved in-context learning, retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), or fine-tuning could further optimize the smaller models'
performance. We also observe mixed results with the ensemble approach: while
some scene attributes show improvement in performance metrics such as F1-score,
others experience a decline. These findings highlight the need for more
sophisticated ensemble techniques to achieve consistent gains across all scene
attributes. This study underscores the potential of leveraging MLLMs for scene
understanding and provides insights into optimizing their performance for
autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end
robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their
scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for
generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to
ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware.
To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization
strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and
rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input
cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry
around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art
neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over
current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer
tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same
open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop
driving simulations.

Result: 实验表明，基础模型在零样本设置下可高效恢复穿戴者身份、场景、性别和种族等信息，准确率达70-80%。

Conclusion: 第一人称视频中的隐私信息极易泄露，需引起重视并采取防护措施。

Abstract: While the rapid proliferation of wearable cameras has raised significant
concerns about egocentric video privacy, prior work has largely overlooked the
unique privacy threats posed to the camera wearer. This work investigates the
core question: How much privacy information about the camera wearer can be
inferred from their first-person view videos? We introduce EgoPrivacy, the
first large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks
in egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic,
individual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private
information ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to
coarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats
inherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel
attack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of
exocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An
extensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models
is presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly
susceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation
models can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by
recovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80%
accuracy. Our code and data are available at

supporting data-driven decision-making in plant breeding. This study presents
MatchPlant, a modular, graphical user interface-supported, open-source Python
pipeline for UAV-based single-plant detection and geospatial trait extraction.
MatchPlant enables end-to-end workflows by integrating UAV image processing,
user-guided annotation, Convolutional Neural Network model training for object
detection, forward projection of bounding boxes onto an orthomosaic, and
shapefile generation for spatial phenotypic analysis. In an early-season maize
case study, MatchPlant achieved reliable detection performance (validation AP:
89.6%, test AP: 85.9%) and effectively projected bounding boxes, covering 89.8%
of manually annotated boxes with 87.5% of projections achieving an Intersection
over Union (IoU) greater than 0.5. Trait values extracted from predicted
bounding instances showed high agreement with manual annotations (r =
0.87-0.97, IoU >= 0.4). Detection outputs were reused across time points to
extract plant height and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with minimal
additional annotation, facilitating efficient temporal phenotyping. By
combining modular design, reproducibility, and geospatial precision, MatchPlant
offers a scalable framework for UAV-based plant-level analysis with broad
applicability in agricultural and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: MAGIC框架有效结合专家知识与AI，生成高质量的医学图像，为数据增强提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Paucity of medical data severely limits the generalizability of diagnostic ML
models, as the full spectrum of disease variability can not be represented by a
small clinical dataset. To address this, diffusion models (DMs) have been
considered as a promising avenue for synthetic image generation and
augmentation. However, they frequently produce medically inaccurate images,
deteriorating the model performance. Expert domain knowledge is critical for
synthesizing images that correctly encode clinical information, especially when
data is scarce and quality outweighs quantity. Existing approaches for
incorporating human feedback, such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), rely on robust reward functions or demand
labor-intensive expert evaluations. Recent progress in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) reveals their strong visual reasoning capabilities,
making them adept candidates as evaluators. In this work, we propose a novel
framework, coined MAGIC (Medically Accurate Generation of Images through
AI-Expert Collaboration), that synthesizes clinically accurate skin disease
images for data augmentation. Our method creatively translates expert-defined
criteria into actionable feedback for image synthesis of DMs, significantly
improving clinical accuracy while reducing the direct human workload.
Experiments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the clinical quality
of synthesized skin disease images, with outputs aligning with dermatologist
assessments. Additionally, augmenting training data with these synthesized
images improves diagnostic accuracy by +9.02% on a challenging 20-condition
skin disease classification task, and by +13.89% in the few-shot setting.

Conclusion: UniDet-D展示了在现实世界中部署的潜力，能够统一处理多种恶劣天气条件下的目标检测任务。

Abstract: Real-world object detection is a challenging task where the captured
images/videos often suffer from complex degradations due to various adverse
weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, low-light, etc. Despite extensive
prior efforts, most existing methods are designed for one specific type of
adverse weather with constraints of poor generalization, under-utilization of
visual features while handling various image degradations. Leveraging a
theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather
images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of
object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object
detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the
proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that
adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing
irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation
across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D
achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather
degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards
unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures,
highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: GroupNL有效提升了CNN模型的鲁棒性和训练效率，适用于IoT设备部署。

Abstract: It has become mainstream to deploy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models
on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the help of the cloud to
provide users with a variety of high-quality services. Most existing methods
have two limitations: (i) low robustness in handling corrupted image data
collected by IoT devices; and (ii) high consumption of computational and
transmission resources. To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear
transformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature
maps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to
improve the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution
filters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small
set of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on
vanilla convolution operation. Then, we split seed feature maps into several
groups, each with a set of different NLFs, to generate corresponding diverse
feature maps with in-place nonlinear processing. Moreover, GroupNL effectively
reduces the parameter transmission between multiple nodes during model training
by setting the hyperparameters of NLFs to random initialization and not
updating them during model training, and reduces the computing resources by
using NLFs to generate feature maps instead of most feature maps generated
based on sliding windows. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, CIFAR-10-C,
Icons50, and ImageNet-1K datasets in NVIDIA RTX GPU platforms show that the
proposed GroupNL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in model robust and
training acceleration. Specifically, on the Icons-50 dataset, the accuracy of
GroupNL-ResNet-18 achieves approximately 2.86% higher than the vanilla
ResNet-18. GroupNL improves training speed by about 53% compared to vanilla CNN
when trained on a cluster of 8 NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video
understanding (videoLLMs) have improved their ability to process dynamic
multimodal data. However, trustworthiness challenges factual inaccuracies,
harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks, undermine
reliability due to video data's spatiotemporal complexities. This study
introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating videoLLMs
across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and
privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the
framework assesses dynamic visual scenarios, cross-modal interactions, and
real-world safety concerns. Our evaluation of 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5
commercial,18 open-source) reveals significant limitations in dynamic visual
scene understanding and cross-modal perturbation resilience. Open-source
videoLLMs show occasional truthfulness advantages but inferior overall
credibility compared to commercial models, with data diversity outperforming
scale effects. These findings highlight the need for advanced safety alignment
to enhance capabilities. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available,
extensible toolbox for standardized trustworthiness assessments, bridging the
gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and critical demands for robustness,
safety, fairness, and privacy.

Result: 实验验证了所提方法在两种设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: ICIMIA是一种简单而有效的成员推理攻击方法，适用于不同知识水平的攻击场景。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance in many downstream tasks. However, LVLMs are trained on large-scale
datasets, which can pose privacy risks if training images contain sensitive
information. Therefore, it is important to detect whether an image is used to
train the LVLM. Recent studies have investigated membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against LVLMs, including detecting image-text pairs and single-modality
content. In this work, we focus on detecting whether a target image is used to
train the target LVLM. We design simple yet effective Image Corruption-Inspired
Membership Inference Attacks (ICIMIA) against LLVLMs, which are inspired by
LVLM's different sensitivity to image corruption for member and non-member
images. We first perform an MIA method under the white-box setting, where we
can obtain the embeddings of the image through the vision part of the target
LVLM. The attacks are based on the embedding similarity between the image and
its corrupted version. We further explore a more practical scenario where we
have no knowledge about target LVLMs and we can only query the target LVLMs
with an image and a question. We then conduct the attack by utilizing the
output text embeddings' similarity. Experiments on existing datasets validate
the effectiveness of our proposed attack methods under those two different
settings.

Result: 在五个CIL基准测试中，EKPC表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EKPC有效平衡了知识保留和模型灵活性，提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to enable AI models to continuously
learn from sequentially arriving data of different classes over time while
retaining previously acquired knowledge. Recently, Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, like prompt pool-based approaches and adapter
tuning, have shown great attraction in CIL. However, these methods either
introduce additional parameters that increase memory usage, or rely on rigid
regularization techniques which reduce forgetting but compromise model
flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Elastic Knowledge
Preservation and Compensation (EKPC) method, integrating Importance-aware
Parameter Regularization (IPR) and Trainable Semantic Drift Compensation (TSDC)
for CIL. Specifically, the IPR method assesses the sensitivity of network
parameters to prior tasks using a novel parameter-importance algorithm. It then
selectively constrains updates within the shared adapter according to these
importance values, thereby preserving previously acquired knowledge while
maintaining the model's flexibility. However, it still exhibits slight semantic
differences in previous knowledge to accommodate new incremental tasks, leading
to decision boundaries confusion in classifier. To eliminate this confusion,
TSDC trains a unified classifier by compensating prototypes with trainable
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on five CIL benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performances to existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is crucial in medical imaging to ensure
reliable diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This study introduces a
novel double ensembling framework that synergistically combines pre-trained
deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction with optimized machine
learning (ML) classifiers for robust classification. The framework incorporates
comprehensive preprocessing and data augmentation of brain magnetic resonance
images (MRI), followed by deep feature extraction using transfer learning with
pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) networks. The novelty lies in the
dual-level ensembling strategy: feature-level ensembling, which integrates deep
features from the top-performing ViT models, and classifier-level ensembling,
which aggregates predictions from hyperparameter-optimized ML classifiers.
Experiments on two public Kaggle MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrate that this
approach significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the
importance of feature and classifier fusion. The proposed methodology also
highlights the critical roles of hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and advanced
preprocessing techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability,
advancing the integration of DL and ML for clinically relevant medical image
analysis.

Abstract: The advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has significantly
reduced the computational burden of adapting large-scale pretrained models to
diverse downstream tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle to
achieve robust performance under domain shifts while maintaining computational
efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Low-rAnk Regulated Gradient
Projection (LARGO) algorithm that integrates dynamic constraints into low-rank
adaptation methods. Specifically, LARGO incorporates parallel trainable
gradient projections to dynamically regulate layer-wise updates, retaining the
Out-Of-Distribution robustness of pretrained model while preserving inter-layer
independence. Additionally, it ensures computational efficiency by mitigating
the influence of gradient dependencies across layers during weight updates.
Besides, through leveraging singular value decomposition of pretrained weights
for structured initialization, we incorporate an SVD-based initialization
strategy that minimizing deviation from pretrained knowledge. Through extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks, LARGO achieves state-of-the-art performance
across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrating improved
robustness under domain shifts with significantly lower computational overhead
compared to existing PEFT methods. The source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: Perceptual-GS通过感知敏感优化，显著提升了3DGS的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel
view synthesis. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively optimize the
distribution of Gaussian primitives based on scene characteristics, making it
challenging to balance reconstruction quality and efficiency. Inspired by human
perception, we propose scene-adaptive perceptual densification for Gaussian
Splatting (Perceptual-GS), a novel framework that integrates perceptual
sensitivity into the 3DGS training process to address this challenge. We first
introduce a perception-aware representation that models human visual
sensitivity while constraining the number of Gaussian primitives. Building on
this foundation, we develop a \cameraready{perceptual sensitivity-adaptive
distribution} to allocate finer Gaussian granularity to visually critical
regions, enhancing reconstruction quality and robustness. Extensive evaluations
on multiple datasets, including BungeeNeRF for large-scale scenes, demonstrate
that Perceptual-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction
quality, efficiency, and robustness. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和ViT的局部-全局特征互补网络（LGCN），通过动态特征融合模块（DFM）和轻量级频率-空间融合适配器提升视觉地点识别（VPR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中CNN和ViT各有优势但难以结合，VPR需要同时捕捉局部细节和全局上下文。

Method: 提出LGCN，结合并行CNN-ViT架构和DFM模块，并引入轻量级适配器增强ViT分支的适应性。

Result: 在多个VPR基准数据集上，LGCN在定位精度和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGCN通过结合CNN和ViT的优势，显著提升了VPR任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) plays a crucial role in robotic localization
and navigation. The key challenge lies in constructing feature representations
that are robust to environmental changes. Existing methods typically adopt
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision Transformers (ViTs) as feature
extractors. However, these architectures excel in different aspects -- CNNs are
effective at capturing local details. At the same time, ViTs are better suited
for modeling global context, making it difficult to leverage the strengths of
both. To address this issue, we propose a local-global feature complementation
network (LGCN) for VPR which integrates a parallel CNN-ViT hybrid architecture
with a dynamic feature fusion module (DFM). The DFM performs dynamic feature
fusion through joint modeling of spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the ViT branch
for VPR tasks, we introduce lightweight frequency-to-spatial fusion adapters
into the frozen ViT backbone. These adapters enable task-specific adaptation
with controlled parameter overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple VPR
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed LGCN consistently outperforms
existing approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中持续学习在参数效率、内存消耗和优化稳定性方面的挑战，避免一阶优化（FO）的局部最优和高内存开销问题。

Method: 选择性应用ZO到视觉或语言模态，保留FO在互补分支；提出分层优化策略，结合ZO和FO；引入梯度符号归一化机制。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现最佳，内存消耗减少89.1%。

Conclusion: ZO优化在VLCL中具有潜力，通过模态和分层优化策略显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Continual learning in vision-language models (VLMs) faces critical challenges
in balancing parameter efficiency, memory consumption, and optimization
stability. While First-Order (FO) optimization (e.g., SGD) dominate current
approaches, their deterministic gradients often trap models in suboptimal local
minima and incur substantial memory overhead. This paper pioneers a systematic
exploration of Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization for vision-language continual
learning (VLCL). We first identify the incompatibility of naive full-ZO
adoption in VLCL due to modality-specific instability. To resolve this, we
selectively applying ZO to either vision or language modalities while retaining
FO in the complementary branch. Furthermore, we develop a layer-wise
optimization paradigm that interleaves ZO and FO across network layers,
capitalizing on the heterogeneous learning dynamics of shallow versus deep
representations. A key theoretical insight reveals that ZO perturbations in
vision branches exhibit higher variance than language counterparts, prompting a
gradient sign normalization mechanism with modality-specific perturbation
constraints. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing memory consumption by
89.1% compared to baselines. Code will be available upon publication.

Result: 总结了DG-ReID的研究进展，提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: DG-ReID是一个新兴且具挑战性的领域，需进一步探索以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Person Re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same
individual captured across non-overlapping camera views, making it a critical
component of intelligent surveillance systems. Traditional ReID methods assume
that the training and test domains share similar characteristics and primarily
focus on learning discriminative features within a given domain. However, they
often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to domain shifts caused by
variations in viewpoint, background, and lighting conditions. To address this
issue, Domain-Adaptive ReID (DA-ReID) methods have been proposed. These
approaches incorporate unlabeled target domain data during training and improve
performance by aligning feature distributions between source and target
domains. Domain-Generalizable ReID (DG-ReID) tackles a more realistic and
challenging setting by aiming to learn domain-invariant features without
relying on any target domain data. Recent methods have explored various
strategies to enhance generalization across diverse environments, but the field
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
survey of DG-ReID. We first review the architectural components of DG-ReID
including the overall setting, commonly used backbone networks and multi-source
input configurations. Then, we categorize and analyze domain generalization
modules that explicitly aim to learn domain-invariant and
identity-discriminative representations. To examine the broader applicability
of these techniques, we further conduct a case study on a related task that
also involves distribution shifts. Finally, we discuss recent trends, open
challenges, and promising directions for future research in DG-ReID. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey dedicated to
DG-ReID.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have become popular in medical image
segmentation due to their lightweight design and long-range dependency modeling
capabilities. However, current segmentation methods frequently encounter
challenges in fetal ultrasound images, such as enclosed anatomical structures,
blurred boundaries, and small anatomical structures. To address the need for

strengths and convolutional layers' local representation advantages to enhance
feature learning. In addition, we also propose an efficient multi-scale feature
fusion module that integrates spatial attention mechanisms, which Integrating
feature information from different layers enhances the feature representation
ability of the model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a non-public

performance in segmentation performance.

Result: 在两个大型多民族手部数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-HandID为刑事调查提供了一种高效的手部图像识别方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to person identification based on hand
images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is
particularly valuable in serious crimes like sexual abuse, where hand images
are often the sole identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method,
CLIP-HandID, leverages pre-trained foundational vision-language model,
particularly CLIP, to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature
representations from hand images given as input to the image encoder of CLIP
using textual prompts as semantic guidance. We propose to learn pseudo-tokens
that represent specific visual contexts or appearance attributes using textual
inversion network since labels of hand images are indexes instead text
descriptions. The learned pseudo-tokens are incorporated into textual prompts
which are given as input to the text encoder of the CLIP to leverage its
multi-modal reasoning to enhance its generalization for identification. Through
extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with
multi-ethnic representation, we show that our method substantially surpasses
existing approaches.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了预测性能，还为城市和交通规划提供了多模态数据集，支持物理景观与社会人口模式的关联研究。

Abstract: This study presents a novel demographics informed deep learning framework
designed to forecast urban spatial transformations by jointly modeling
geographic satellite imagery, socio-demographics, and travel behavior dynamics.
The proposed model employs an encoder-decoder architecture with temporal gated
residual connections, integrating satellite imagery and demographic data to
accurately forecast future spatial transformations. The study also introduces a
demographics prediction component which ensures that predicted satellite
imagery are consistent with demographic features, significantly enhancing
physiological realism and socioeconomic accuracy. The framework is enhanced by
a proposed multi-objective loss function complemented by a semantic loss
function that balances visual realism with temporal coherence. The experimental
results from this study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
model compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving higher structural
similarity (SSIM: 0.8342) and significantly improved demographic consistency
(Demo-loss: 0.14 versus 0.95 and 0.96 for baseline models). Additionally, the
study validates co-evolutionary theories of urban development, demonstrating
quantifiable bidirectional influences between built environment characteristics
and population patterns. The study also contributes a comprehensive multimodal
dataset pairing satellite imagery sequences (2012-2023) with corresponding
demographic and travel behavior attributes, addressing existing gaps in urban
and transportation planning resources by explicitly connecting physical
landscape evolution with socio-demographic patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像边缘检测中，训练使用连续值输出而评估使用二值预测，这种不匹配削弱了学习目标与实际任务性能的联系。

Method: 提出基于距离权重函数(DWF)的损失调整机制，根据像素的正确性和决策边界距离重新加权，并引入自适应过程估计最优二值化阈值。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上的实验证明了BAA的有效性。

Conclusion: BAA为结构化预测任务中连续优化与离散评估之间的差距提供了一种通用策略。

Abstract: Image edge detection (ED) faces a fundamental mismatch between training and
inference: models are trained using continuous-valued outputs but evaluated
using binary predictions. This misalignment, caused by the
non-differentiability of binarization, weakens the link between learning
objectives and actual task performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical
method to design a Binarization-Aware Adjuster (BAA), which explicitly
incorporates binarization behavior into gradient-based optimization. At the
core of BAA is a novel loss adjustment mechanism based on a Distance Weight
Function (DWF), which reweights pixel-wise contributions according to their
correctness and proximity to the decision boundary. This emphasizes
decision-critical regions while down-weighting less influential ones. We also
introduce a self-adaptive procedure to estimate the optimal binarization
threshold for BAA, further aligning training dynamics with inference behavior.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Beyond ED, BAA offers a generalizable strategy
for bridging the gap between continuous optimization and discrete evaluation in
structured prediction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频TTA方法主要依赖视觉信号，忽略了音频数据的潜在贡献，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过预训练音频模型分类视频中的音频信号，并利用大语言模型将音频预测映射到视频标签空间，生成音频辅助伪标签；设计灵活的适应周期以优化每个样本的自适应过程。

Result: 在多个数据集（包括新构建的音频-视频TTA数据集）上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了视频分类模型的适应性能。

Conclusion: 本文为音频信息在视频TTA中的应用提供了创新方法，展示了音频辅助伪标签的有效性，推动了多模态TTA的发展。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to boost the generalization capability of a
trained model by conducting self-/unsupervised learning during the testing
phase. While most existing TTA methods for video primarily utilize visual
supervisory signals, they often overlook the potential contribution of inherent
audio data. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that incorporates
audio information into video TTA. Our method capitalizes on the rich semantic
content of audio to generate audio-assisted pseudo-labels, a new concept in the
context of video TTA. Specifically, we propose an audio-to-video label mapping
method by first employing pre-trained audio models to classify audio signals
extracted from videos and then mapping the audio-based predictions to video
label spaces through large language models, thereby establishing a connection
between the audio categories and video labels. To effectively leverage the
generated pseudo-labels, we present a flexible adaptation cycle that determines
the optimal number of adaptation iterations for each sample, based on changes
in loss and consistency across different views. This enables a customized
adaptation process for each sample. Experimental results on two widely used
datasets (UCF101-C and Kinetics-Sounds-C), as well as on two newly constructed
audio-video TTA datasets (AVE-C and AVMIT-C) with various corruption types,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method consistently improves
adaptation performance across different video classification models and
represents a significant step forward in integrating audio information into
video TTA. Code: https://github.com/keikeiqi/Audio-Assisted-TTA.

Method: 比较了自定义CNN、预训练Transformer模型和AutoML解决方案，并分析了数据增强对不同架构的影响。

Result: 数据增强显著提升纯ViT模型的性能，但对混合ViT-CNN模型有负面影响；小patch尺寸的ViT在增强数据上表现更好；DINOv2模型在增强数据下表现改善。

Conclusion: 模型架构与数据增强策略需根据数据集特点选择，过大的模型在小数据集上表现不佳。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning strategies for
detecting hypertensive retinopathy from fundus images, a central task in the
HRDC challenge~\cite{qian2025hrdc}. We investigate three distinct approaches: a
custom CNN, a suite of pre-trained transformer-based models, and an AutoML
solution. Our findings reveal a stark, architecture-dependent response to data
augmentation. Augmentation significantly boosts the performance of pure Vision
Transformers (ViTs), which we hypothesize is due to their weaker inductive
biases, forcing them to learn robust spatial and structural features.
Conversely, the same augmentation strategy degrades the performance of hybrid
ViT-CNN models, whose stronger, pre-existing biases from the CNN component may
be "confused" by the transformations. We show that smaller patch sizes
(ViT-B/8) excel on augmented data, enhancing fine-grained detail capture.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a powerful self-supervised model like DINOv2
fails on the original, limited dataset but is "rescued" by augmentation,
highlighting the critical need for data diversity to unlock its potential.
Preliminary tests with a ViT-Large model show poor performance, underscoring
the risk of using overly-capacitive models on specialized, smaller datasets.
This work provides critical insights into the interplay between model
architecture, data augmentation, and dataset size for medical image
classification.

Motivation: HDR和WCG技术提升了图像质量，但增加了数据需求，需要更精确的图像质量评估方法。

Method: 构建包含100张测试图像的AIC-HDR2025数据集，使用JPEG AIC-3测试方法进行主观研究，收集34,560个评分。

Result: AIC-3方法能精确估计HDR质量，95%置信区间平均宽度为0.27。

Conclusion: AIC-HDR2025数据集公开可用，为HDR图像质量评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG) technologies
significantly improve color reproduction compared to standard dynamic range
(SDR) and standard color gamuts, resulting in more accurate, richer, and more
immersive images. However, HDR increases data demands, posing challenges for
bandwidth efficiency and compression techniques.
  Advances in compression and display technologies require more precise image
quality assessment, particularly in the high-fidelity range where perceptual
differences are subtle.
  To address this gap, we introduce AIC-HDR2025, the first such HDR dataset,
comprising 100 test images generated from five HDR sources, each compressed
using four codecs at five compression levels. It covers the high-fidelity
range, from visible distortions to compression levels below the visually
lossless threshold.
  A subjective study was conducted using the JPEG AIC-3 test methodology,
combining plain and boosted triplet comparisons. In total, 34,560 ratings were
collected from 151 participants across four fully controlled labs. The results
confirm that AIC-3 enables precise HDR quality estimation, with 95\% confidence
intervals averaging a width of 0.27 at 1 JND. In addition, several recently
proposed objective metrics were evaluated based on their correlation with
subjective ratings. The dataset is publicly available.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法在缺乏额外信息时存在模糊性，用户可能希望基于不同标准（如形状或颜色）对同一数据进行聚类。文本引导的图像聚类方法旨在通过自然语言指令解决这一问题。

Method: ITGC采用迭代发现过程，结合无监督聚类目标，生成与用户指令更匹配的可解释视觉概念。

Result: 在多种图像聚类和细粒度分类基准测试中，ITGC表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITGC通过文本引导的迭代聚类方法，显著提升了聚类结果与用户意图的对齐度。

Abstract: Traditional clustering methods aim to group unlabeled data points based on
their similarity to each other. However, clustering, in the absence of
additional information, is an ill-posed problem as there may be many different,
yet equally valid, ways to partition a dataset. Distinct users may want to use
different criteria to form clusters in the same data, e.g. shape v.s. color.
Recently introduced text-guided image clustering methods aim to address this
ambiguity by allowing users to specify the criteria of interest using natural
language instructions. This instruction provides the necessary context and
control needed to obtain clusters that are more aligned with the users' intent.
We propose a new text-guided clustering approach named ITGC that uses an
iterative discovery process, guided by an unsupervised clustering objective, to
generate interpretable visual concepts that better capture the criteria
expressed in a user's instructions. We report superior performance compared to
existing methods across a wide variety of image clustering and fine-grained
classification benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
under a long-tailed distribution, which involves discovering novel categories
in an unlabelled dataset using knowledge from a set of labelled categories.
Existing works assume a uniform distribution for both datasets, but real-world
data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, where a few categories contain
most examples, while others have only a few. While the long-tailed distribution
is well-studied in supervised and semi-supervised settings, it remains
unexplored in the GCD context. We identify two challenges in this setting -
balancing classifier learning and estimating category numbers - and propose a
framework based on confident sample selection and density-based clustering to
tackle them. Our experiments on both long-tailed and conventional GCD datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的推理时间优化框架，通过后处理模块提升事件眼动追踪的准确性，适用于微表情分析和精神状态解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件眼动追踪在认知状态推断中具有高时间分辨率和抗运动伪影的优势，但现有模型的输出需要进一步优化以提高一致性。

Method: 框架包含两个后处理模块：运动感知中值滤波和基于光流的局部细化，并提出了新的抖动度量标准。

Result: 在多个基线模型上显著提升了事件眼动信号的时空一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来多模态情感识别系统的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive
state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion
artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as
attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic,
inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing
event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or
requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i)
Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while
preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement,
which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial
jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy
metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness
of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal
complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency
of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks
such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on
controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with
multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新方法改进基于扩散模型的图像修复技术，解决了颜色不匹配和内容不连贯的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在图像修复中取得了显著进展，但实现无缝连续性仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 引入改进的变分自编码器以校正颜色失衡；2. 提出两步训练策略优化扩散过程中的内容融合。

Result: 实验表明，新方法有效减少了不连续性，生成了高质量且视觉连贯的修复结果。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了图像修复的连贯性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Image inpainting is the task of reconstructing missing or damaged parts of an
image in a way that seamlessly blends with the surrounding content. With the
advent of advanced generative models, especially diffusion models and
generative adversarial networks, inpainting has achieved remarkable
improvements in visual quality and coherence. However, achieving seamless
continuity remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose two novel
methods to address discrepancy issues in diffusion-based inpainting models.
First, we introduce a modified Variational Autoencoder that corrects color
imbalances, ensuring that the final inpainted results are free of color
mismatches. Second, we propose a two-step training strategy that improves the
blending of generated and existing image content during the diffusion process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods effectively
reduce discontinuity and produce high-quality inpainting results that are
coherent and visually appealing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态（FoG）是帕金森病患者的常见症状，实时识别FoG有助于改善患者的治疗和管理方案。

Method: 采用Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM融合模型分析加速度计数据，区分FoG事件和正常运动。

Result: 在Kaggle数据集上，模型准确率为92.6%，F1分数为80.9%，平均精度为52.06%。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在FoG识别领域具有潜力，可为帕金森病患者提供更好的治疗方案。

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a special symptom found in patients with
Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients who have FoG abruptly lose the capacity to
walk as they normally would. Accelerometers worn by patients can record
movement data during these episodes, and machine learning algorithms can be
useful to categorize this information. Thus, the combination may be able to
identify FoG in real time. In order to identify FoG events in accelerometer
data, we introduce the Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model in this paper.
The model's capability to differentiate between FoG episodes and normal
movement was used to evaluate its performance, and on the Kaggle Parkinson's
Freezing of Gait dataset, the proposed Transformer Encoder-Bi-LSTM fusion model
produced 92.6% accuracy, 80.9% F1 score, and 52.06% in terms of mean average
precision. The findings highlight how Deep Learning-based approaches may
progress the field of FoG identification and help PD patients receive better
treatments and management plans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 传统图像相似度指标在评估真实场景图像与人工生成视角图像时效果不佳。研究评估了新的感知相似度指标DreamSim及三种传统指标（SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS）在新视角合成（NVS）中的表现。结果表明，DreamSim对轻微缺陷更鲁棒，能更有效评估图像的高层相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像相似度指标无法有效区分轻微像素变化与严重损坏的图像，而DreamSim能更好地评估真实场景中常见但轻微的渲染缺陷。

Method: 通过创建人工损坏图像集，量化各相似度指标的敏感性和区分能力。

Result: 传统指标难以区分轻微与严重损坏的图像，而DreamSim对轻微缺陷更鲁棒，能更有效评估NVS渲染质量。

Conclusion: DreamSim在评估NVS渲染质量时更有效，尤其适用于真实场景中轻微渲染缺陷不影响图像实用性的情况。

Abstract: Traditional image similarity metrics are ineffective at evaluating the
similarity between a real image of a scene and an artificially generated
version of that viewpoint [6, 9, 13, 14]. Our research evaluates the
effectiveness of a new, perceptual-based similarity metric, DreamSim [2], and
three popular image similarity metrics: Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS) [18, 19] in novel view synthesis (NVS) applications. We create a corpus
of artificially corrupted images to quantify the sensitivity and discriminative
power of each of the image similarity metrics. These tests reveal that
traditional metrics are unable to effectively differentiate between images with
minor pixel-level changes and those with substantial corruption, whereas
DreamSim is more robust to minor defects and can effectively evaluate the
high-level similarity of the image. Additionally, our results demonstrate that
DreamSim provides a more effective and useful evaluation of render quality,
especially for evaluating NVS renders in real-world use cases where slight
rendering corruptions are common, but do not affect image utility for human
tasks.

TL;DR: MVP-CBM通过多层视觉偏好建模提升概念瓶颈模型的解释性和准确性，解决了传统方法仅依赖最后一层特征的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型（CBM）仅关联视觉编码器的最后一层特征与概念，忽视了概念在不同层的偏好变化，导致解释性不足。

Method: 提出MVP-CBM，包含两个模块：1）层内概念偏好建模，捕捉概念在不同层的偏好；2）多层概念稀疏激活融合，稀疏聚合多层概念激活以提升性能。

Result: 在多个医学分类基准测试中，MVP-CBM实现了最先进的准确性和解释性。

Conclusion: MVP-CBM通过显式建模概念偏好，全面利用多层视觉信息，提供了更准确和细致的模型解释。

Abstract: The concept bottleneck model (CBM), as a technique improving interpretability
via linking predictions to human-understandable concepts, makes high-risk and
life-critical medical image classification credible. Typically, existing CBM
methods associate the final layer of visual encoders with concepts to explain
the model's predictions. However, we empirically discover the phenomenon of
concept preference variation, that is, the concepts are preferably associated
with the features at different layers than those only at the final layer; yet a
blind last-layer-based association neglects such a preference variation and
thus weakens the accurate correspondences between features and concepts,
impairing model interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Multi-layer Visual Preference-enhanced Concept Bottleneck Model (MVP-CBM),
which comprises two key novel modules: (1) intra-layer concept preference
modeling, which captures the preferred association of different concepts with
features at various visual layers, and (2) multi-layer concept sparse
activation fusion, which sparsely aggregates concept activations from multiple
layers to enhance performance. Thus, by explicitly modeling concept
preferences, MVP-CBM can comprehensively leverage multi-layer visual
information to provide a more nuanced and accurate explanation of model
decisions. Extensive experiments on several public medical classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MVP-CBM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
interoperability, verifying its superiority. Code is available at

TL;DR: DejaVid是一种无需重新训练或修改架构的编码器无关方法，通过将视频转换为可变长度的多变量时间序列（MTS）并学习时间步和特征的权重，显著提升了视频分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视频编码器模型通过平均多个片段的嵌入输出生成固定长度表示，未能有效捕捉时间相关特征（如视频时长、事件顺序和特征重要性变化）。现有方法需要昂贵的架构修改和重新训练。

Method: DejaVid将视频转换为保留时序的MTS，并学习每个时间步和特征的权重。采用受传统时间序列对齐算法启发的神经网络架构。

Result: 在Something-Something V2、Kinetics-400和HMDB51数据集上分别达到77.2%、89.1%和88.6%的Top-1准确率，仅增加1.8%的可学习参数和不到3小时的训练时间。

Conclusion: DejaVid通过简单高效的方式提升了视频编码器的性能，无需重新训练或修改架构，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In recent years, large transformer-based video encoder models have greatly
advanced state-of-the-art performance on video classification tasks. However,
these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from
multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach
fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video
durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature
significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require
significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them
impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model
performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our
framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of
embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally
preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then
learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing
us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a
new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment
algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid
substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder,
achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on
Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional
learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time. Our code
is available at https://github.com/darrylho/DejaVid.

TL;DR: VisFlow是一种无需训练的高效框架，通过调整注意力模式减少视觉语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在视觉幻觉问题，导致错误描述视觉内容。

Method: VisFlow通过分析三种病态注意力行为（视觉基础弱、语言先验主导、提示冗余），提出两种推理时干预方法：TAI和HAI。

Result: 实验表明，VisFlow显著减少幻觉并提升视觉事实性，计算成本极低。

Conclusion: VisFlow为缓解视觉幻觉提供了一种高效且无需修改模型的解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of multimodal tasks. However, they remain prone to visual
hallucination (VH), often producing confident but incorrect descriptions of
visual content. We present VisFlow, an efficient and training-free framework
designed to mitigate VH by directly manipulating attention patterns during
inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify three key pathological
attention behaviors in LVLMs: (1) weak visual grounding, where attention to
visual tokens is insufficient or misallocated, over-focusing on uninformative
regions; (2) language prior dominance, where excessive attention to prior
response tokens reinforces autoregressive patterns and impairs multimodal
alignment; (3) prompt redundancy, where many attention heads fixate on system
prompt tokens, disrupting the integration of image, instruction, and response
content. To address these issues, we introduce two inference-time
interventions: token-level attention intervention (TAI), which enhances focus
on salient visual content, and head-level attention intervention (HAI), which
suppresses over-attention to prompt and nearby text tokens. VisFlow operates
without additional training or model modifications. Extensive experiments
across models and benchmarks show that VisFlow effectively reduces
hallucinations and improves visual factuality, with negligible computational
cost.

Conclusion: OscNet v1.5是一种高效节能的机器学习框架，适用于CMOS振荡器计算。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable advancements but at the cost of
significant computational resources. This has created an urgent need for a
novel and energy-efficient computational fabric. CMOS Oscillator Networks
(OscNet) is a brain inspired and specially designed hardware for low energy
consumption. In this paper, we propose a Hopfield Network based machine
learning algorithm that can be implemented on OscNet. The network is trained
using forward propagation alone to learn sparsely connected weights, yet
achieves an 8% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deep learning
models on MNIST dataset. OscNet v1.5 achieves competitive accuracy on MNIST and
is well-suited for implementation using CMOS-compatible ring oscillator arrays
with SHIL. In oscillator-based implementation, we utilize only 24% of the
connections used in a fully connected Hopfield network, with merely a 0.1% drop
in accuracy. OscNet v1.5 relies solely on forward propagation and employs
sparse connections, making it an energy-efficient machine learning pipeline
designed for CMOS oscillator computing. The repository for OscNet family is:

Method: 收集并标注了2,413个UI教学视频数据集（MS4UI），涵盖视频分割、文本摘要和视频摘要任务，用于全面评估。

Result: 实验显示，现有最先进的多模态摘要方法在UI视频摘要任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法以更好地支持UI教学视频的多模态摘要任务。

Abstract: We study multi-modal summarization for instructional videos, whose goal is to
provide users an efficient way to learn skills in the form of text instructions
and key video frames. We observe that existing benchmarks focus on generic
semantic-level video summarization, and are not suitable for providing
step-by-step executable instructions and illustrations, both of which are
crucial for instructional videos. We propose a novel benchmark for user
interface (UI) instructional video summarization to fill the gap. We collect a
dataset of 2,413 UI instructional videos, which spans over 167 hours. These
videos are manually annotated for video segmentation, text summarization, and
video summarization, which enable the comprehensive evaluations for concise and
executable video summarization. We conduct extensive experiments on our
collected MS4UI dataset, which suggest that state-of-the-art multi-modal
summarization methods struggle on UI video summarization, and highlight the
importance of new methods for UI instructional video summarization.

Result: 实验表明性能快速达到平台期，少量优化步骤即可实现最佳性能。

Conclusion: 优化初始噪声的方法在小VRAM GPU上高效且有效。

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that investing computing resources in searching
for good initial noise for a text-to-image diffusion model helps improve
performance. However, previous studies required external models to evaluate the
resulting images, which is impossible on GPUs with small VRAM. For these
reasons, we apply Best-of-N inference-time scaling to algorithms that optimize
the initial noise of a diffusion model without external models across multiple
datasets and backbones. We demonstrate that inference-time scaling for
text-to-image diffusion models in this setting quickly reaches a performance
plateau, and a relatively small number of optimization steps suffices to
achieve the maximum achievable performance with each algorithm.

Conclusion: 提出的3D网格引导框架显著提升了手部修复的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: The malformed hands in the AI-generated images seriously affect the
authenticity of the images. To refine malformed hands, existing depth-based
approaches use a hand depth estimator to guide the refinement of malformed
hands. Due to the performance limitations of the hand depth estimator, many
hand details cannot be represented, resulting in errors in the generated hands,
such as confusing the palm and the back of the hand. To solve this problem, we
propose a 3D mesh-guided refinement framework using a diffusion pipeline. We
use a state-of-the-art 3D hand mesh estimator, which provides more details of
the hands. For training, we collect and reannotate a dataset consisting of RGB
images and 3D hand mesh. Then we design a diffusion inpainting model to
generate refined outputs guided by 3D hand meshes. For inference, we propose a
double check algorithm to facilitate the 3D hand mesh estimator to obtain
robust hand mesh guidance to obtain our refined results. Beyond malformed hand
refinement, we propose a novel hand pose transformation method. It increases
the flexibility and diversity of the malformed hand refinement task. We made
the restored images mimic the hand poses of the reference images. The pose
transformation requires no additional training. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的小目标检测面临目标尺寸小、信噪比低和特征提取有限等挑战，现有方法计算负担重且细节模糊。

Method: MGDFIS包含三个模块：FusionLock-TSS注意力模块、全局-细节集成模块和动态像素注意力模块，分别用于高效特征提取、多尺度上下文融合和像素级权重分配。

Result: 在VisDrone基准测试中，MGDFIS优于现有方法，实现了高精度和低推理时间。

Conclusion: MGDFIS在准确性和资源消耗之间取得了平衡，为资源受限的无人机平台提供了实用的小目标检测解决方案。

Abstract: Small object detection in UAV imagery is crucial for applications such as
search-and-rescue, traffic monitoring, and environmental surveillance, but it
is hampered by tiny object size, low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited
feature extraction. Existing multi-scale fusion methods help, but add
computational burden and blur fine details, making small object detection in
cluttered scenes difficult. To overcome these challenges, we propose the
Multi-scale Global-detail Feature Integration Strategy (MGDFIS), a unified
fusion framework that tightly couples global context with local detail to boost
detection performance while maintaining efficiency. MGDFIS comprises three
synergistic modules: the FusionLock-TSS Attention Module, which marries
token-statistics self-attention with DynamicTanh normalization to highlight
spectral and spatial cues at minimal cost; the Global-detail Integration
Module, which fuses multi-scale context via directional convolution and
parallel attention while preserving subtle shape and texture variations; and
the Dynamic Pixel Attention Module, which generates pixel-wise weighting maps
to rebalance uneven foreground and background distributions and sharpen
responses to true object regions. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone
benchmark demonstrate that MGDFIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across diverse backbone architectures and detection frameworks,
achieving superior precision and recall with low inference time. By striking an
optimal balance between accuracy and resource usage, MGDFIS provides a
practical solution for small-object detection on resource-constrained UAV
platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法通过学习平衡且分离良好的表示，显著提升了自监督学习在长尾数据集上的性能。

Abstract: This work addresses the task of self-supervised learning (SSL) on a
long-tailed dataset that aims to learn balanced and well-separated
representations for downstream tasks such as image classification. This task is
crucial because the real world contains numerous object categories, and their
distributions are inherently imbalanced. Towards robust SSL on a
class-imbalanced dataset, we investigate leveraging a network trained using
unlabeled out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are prevalently available online.
We first train a network using both in-domain (ID) and sampled OOD data by
back-propagating the proposed pseudo semantic discrimination loss alongside a
domain discrimination loss. The OOD data sampling and loss functions are
designed to learn a balanced and well-separated embedding space. Subsequently,
we further optimize the network on ID data by unsupervised contrastive learning
while using the previously trained network as a guiding network. The guiding
network is utilized to select positive/negative samples and to control the
strengths of attractive/repulsive forces in contrastive learning. We also
distil and transfer its embedding space to the training network to maintain
balancedness and separability. Through experiments on four publicly available
long-tailed datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in understanding relationships between visual and textual data
through joint embedding spaces. Despite their effectiveness, these models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality,
posing significant security concerns. Building upon our previous work on
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), which introduced learnable text prompts to
enhance adversarial robustness in VLMs without extensive parameter training, we
present a significant extension by introducing the Neural Augmentor framework
for Multi-modal Adversarial Prompt Tuning (NAP-Tuning).Our key innovations
include: (1) extending AdvPT from text-only to multi-modal prompting across
both text and visual modalities, (2) expanding from single-layer to multi-layer
prompt architectures, and (3) proposing a novel architecture-level redesign
through our Neural Augmentor approach, which implements feature purification to
directly address the distortions introduced by adversarial attacks in feature
space. Our NAP-Tuning approach incorporates token refiners that learn to
reconstruct purified features through residual connections, allowing for
modality-specific and layer-specific feature correction.Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that NAP-Tuning significantly outperforms existing
methods across various datasets and attack types. Notably, our approach shows
significant improvements over the strongest baselines under the challenging
AutoAttack benchmark, outperforming them by 33.5% on ViT-B16 and 33.0% on
ViT-B32 architectures while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: The segmentation of coal maceral groups can be described as a semantic
segmentation process of coal maceral group images, which is of great
significance for studying the chemical properties of coal. Generally, existing
semantic segmentation models of coal maceral groups use the method of stacking
parameters to achieve higher accuracy. It leads to increased computational
requirements and impacts model training efficiency. At the same time, due to
the professionalism and diversity of coal maceral group images sampling,
obtaining the number of samples for model training requires a long time and
professional personnel operation. To address these issues, We have innovatively
developed an IoT-based DA-VIT parallel network model. By utilizing this model,
we can continuously broaden the dataset through IoT and achieving sustained
improvement in the accuracy of coal maceral groups segmentation. Besides, we
decouple the parallel network from the backbone network to ensure the normal
using of the backbone network during model data updates. Secondly, DCSA
mechanism of DA-VIT is introduced to enhance the local feature information of
coal microscopic images. This DCSA can decompose the large kernels of
convolutional attention into multiple scales and reduce 81.18% of
parameters.Finally, we performed the contrast experiment and ablation
experiment between DA-VIT and state-of-the-art methods at lots of evaluation
metrics. Experimental results show that DA-VIT-Base achieves 92.14% pixel
accuracy and 63.18% mIoU. Params and FLOPs of DA-VIT-Tiny are 4.95M and 8.99G,
respectively. All of the evaluation metrics of the proposed DA-VIT are better
than other state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型在孤立对象的新视角合成上表现良好，但在复杂、遮挡严重的场景中表现不佳。GenMOJO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: GenMOJO将场景分解为独立对象，为每个对象优化可变形高斯集，利用对象中心扩散模型推断新视角中的未观测区域，并通过联合高斯溅射渲染完整场景。

Result: GenMOJO生成了空间和时间上的4D对象重建，并从单目输入中生成准确的2D和3D点轨迹。定量评估和人类感知研究证实其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenMOJO在复杂场景的新视角合成和点轨迹生成方面表现更优，为动态场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular,
multi-object videos with heavy occlusions, and introduce GenMOJO, a novel
approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization
with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing models perform well
on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to
complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into
individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per
object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric
diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs
joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object
occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between
object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos,
GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering
constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object
reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point
tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human
studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and
produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型因高计算成本和低执行频率，难以满足实时任务需求，且现有加速方法未解决时空冗余问题。

Result: 实验显示，SP-VLA在精度下降小于3%的情况下，实现1.5倍加速，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SP-VLA通过联合优化时空冗余，显著提升VLA模型的实时性能，适用于机器人操作等任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for
their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and
low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as
robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration
methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that
these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result,
temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in
visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified
framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning
tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that
reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a
lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key
decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA
actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model
and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive
execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial
redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning
method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based
on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two
mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and
salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining
high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves up to
1.5$\times$ acceleration with less than 3% drop in accuracy, outperforming
existing approaches in multiple tasks.

Motivation: 现有多模态大模型采用静态模态融合策略，忽视模态的实例级可靠性或语义贡献，导致性能不佳。

Method: DMS通过置信度、不确定性和语义一致性评估模态，结合可学习或基于规则的调度器生成软模态权重，并引入模态权重一致性损失以稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明，DMS在VQA、图像-文本检索和字幕生成任务中显著提升了性能，尤其在模态损坏或丢失条件下。

Conclusion: DMS为多模态建模提供了一种通用且有效的机制，增强了实例感知和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
vision-language understanding and generation tasks. However, existing MLLMs
typically rely on static modality fusion strategies, which treat all modalities
equally regardless of their instance-level reliability or semantic
contribution. This often leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
scenarios with noisy, missing, or misaligned modalities.
  In this paper, we propose Dynamic Modality Scheduling (DMS), a novel
framework that adaptively adjusts the contribution of each modality at a
per-sample level. DMS evaluates each modality based on three key factors: (1)
\textit{confidence}, estimated from predictive entropy; (2)
\textit{uncertainty}, obtained via Monte Carlo dropout; and (3)
\textit{semantic consistency}, computed through inter-modal similarity. These
signals are combined through a learnable or rule-based scheduler to generate
soft modality weights used in downstream fusion.To ensure stable training, we
further introduce a \textit{Modality Weight Consistency Loss}, which
regularizes the fused representation to stay close to unimodal embeddings
proportionally to their assigned weights. Our method is model-agnostic and can
be integrated into existing MLLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVA. Experimental
results on VQA, image-text retrieval, and captioning tasks show that DMS
significantly improves both clean and robust performance, especially under
modality corruption or dropout conditions. This work provides a general and
effective mechanism to enable instance-aware and robustness-enhanced multimodal
modeling.

Motivation: 单视图训练在3DGS中导致梯度方差大和优化效果差，而多视图训练虽能解决此问题，但直接实现会带来高开销和密度控制问题。

Method: 改进光栅化以减少多视图训练开销，提出3D距离感知D-SSIM损失和多视图自适应密度控制。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著提升3DGS及其变体的性能，使其摆脱单视图训练的限制。

Conclusion: 多视图训练结合提出的改进方法，有效解决了3DGS的优化问题，提升了其性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a preferred choice alongside
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in inverse rendering due to its superior
rendering speed. Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize
"single-view" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per
iteration, in contrast to NeRF's "multi-view" mini-batch training, which
leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead
to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic
gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However,
implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering
multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in
suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view
assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to
minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D
distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better
suits multi-view scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
methods significantly enhance the performance of 3DGS and its variants, freeing
3DGS from the constraints of single-view training.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have achieved impressive progress across a wide
range of vision-language tasks. However, existing approaches often adopt fixed
or task-specific fusion strategies, neglecting the intrinsic variability of
modality reliability and sample complexity. In this paper, we propose
Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Scheduling (MA-AFS), a general framework that
learns to dynamically modulate the contribution of each modality on a
per-instance basis. MA-AFS introduces a lightweight neural scheduler that
predicts modality fusion weights by integrating visual and textual entropy
signals along with cross-modal agreement cues. This enables the model to
adaptively emphasize more reliable modalities, especially under noisy, missing,
or misaligned inputs. We formulate the fusion process as a differentiable
scheduling mechanism, analyze its theoretical consistency and regularization
effect, and demonstrate that it improves robustness without increasing model
capacity significantly. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval,
captioning, and visual question answering show that MA-AFS achieves consistent
performance gains over strong baselines such as CLIP, ALBEF, and BLIP.
Moreover, MA-AFS exhibits improved robustness under modality corruption and
enhanced generalization under domain shifts. Our work highlights the importance
of adaptive fusion and opens a promising direction toward reliable and
uncertainty-aware multimodal learning.

Motivation: 现有特征编码方法多为架构特定，无法适应CNN和Transformer特征共存的现实场景，因此需要研究跨架构的统一编码方法。

Method: 提出两步分布对齐方法：1）格式对齐，统一特征为2D token格式；2）特征值对齐，通过截断和归一化协调统计分布。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，该方法在率-精度权衡上优于架构特定基线。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨异构模型架构的通用特征压缩迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Feature coding has become increasingly important in scenarios where semantic
representations rather than raw pixels are transmitted and stored. However,
most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or
Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios
where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we
introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding
(CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress
features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment
method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token
format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes
statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt
to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This
work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across
heterogeneous model architectures.

Conclusion: 自适应Dropout有效解决了盲超分辨率任务中的特征正则化问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Blind Super-Resolution (blind SR) aims to enhance the model's generalization
ability with unknown degradation, yet it still encounters severe overfitting
issues. Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances
generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind
SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before
the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at
intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at
intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized
feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying
dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which
we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it
introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method
for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates
application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for
training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate
the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in
generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an
adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise
annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past
regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets,
also highly effective in other image restoration tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Existing segmentation models trained on a single medical imaging dataset
often lack robustness when encountering unseen organs or tumors. Developing a
robust model capable of identifying rare or novel tumor categories not present
during training is crucial for advancing medical imaging applications. We
propose DSM, a novel framework that leverages diffusion and state space models
to segment unseen tumor categories beyond the training data. DSM utilizes two
sets of object queries trained within modified attention decoders to enhance
classification accuracy. Initially, the model learns organ queries using an
object-aware feature grouping strategy to capture organ-level visual features.
It then refines tumor queries by focusing on diffusion-based visual prompts,
enabling precise segmentation of previously unseen tumors. Furthermore, we
incorporate diffusion-guided feature fusion to improve semantic segmentation
performance. By integrating CLIP text embeddings, DSM captures
category-sensitive classes to improve linguistic transfer knowledge, thereby
enhancing the model's robustness across diverse scenarios and multi-label
tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DSM in
various tumor segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Infrared small target (IRST) detection is challenging in simultaneously
achieving precise, universal, robust and efficient performance due to extremely
dim targets and strong interference. Current learning-based methods attempt to
leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal
domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while
incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more
essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through
theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and
correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant
superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate
whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks,
we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the
importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above
conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal
anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network
(DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST
detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the
effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our
DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on
widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a
significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a
new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which
can promote the development of IRST detection. Codes are available at

Abstract: DL based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection has tremendous
advantages in numerous areas. However, it still faces some problems, such as
the lack of prior knowledge, which seriously affects detection accuracy. In
order to solve this problem, we propose a scene-aware SAR ship detection method
based on unsupervised sea-land segmentation. This method follows a classical
two-stage framework and is enhanced by two models: the unsupervised land and
sea segmentation module (ULSM) and the land attention suppression module
(LASM). ULSM and LASM can adaptively guide the network to reduce attention on
land according to the type of scenes (inshore scene and offshore scene) and add
prior knowledge (sea land segmentation information) to the network, thereby
reducing the network's attention to land directly and enhancing offshore
detection performance relatively. This increases the accuracy of ship detection
and enhances the interpretability of the model. Specifically, in consideration
of the lack of land sea segmentation labels in existing deep learning-based SAR
ship detection datasets, ULSM uses an unsupervised approach to classify the
input data scene into inshore and offshore types and performs sea-land
segmentation for inshore scenes. LASM uses the sea-land segmentation
information as prior knowledge to reduce the network's attention to land. We
conducted our experiments using the publicly available SSDD dataset, which
demonstrated the effectiveness of our network.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face significant challenges when dealing with
the diverse resolutions and aspect ratios of real-world images, as most
existing models rely on fixed, low-resolution inputs. While recent studies have
explored integrating native resolution visual encoding to improve model
performance, such efforts remain fragmented and lack a systematic framework
within the open-source community. Moreover, existing benchmarks fall short in
evaluating VLMs under varied visual conditions, often neglecting resolution as
a critical factor. To address the "Resolution Dilemma" stemming from both model
design and benchmark limitations, we introduce RC-Bench, a novel benchmark
specifically designed to systematically evaluate VLM capabilities under extreme
visual conditions, with an emphasis on resolution and aspect ratio variations.
In conjunction, we propose NativeRes-LLaVA, an open-source training framework
that empowers VLMs to effectively process images at their native resolutions
and aspect ratios. Based on RC-Bench and NativeRes-LLaVA, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on existing visual encoding strategies. The results
show that Native Resolution Visual Encoding significantly improves the
performance of VLMs on RC-Bench as well as other resolution-centric benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的深度联合源信道编码（JSCC）框架，专为资源受限的6G网络设计，通过智能语义感知传输提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要更高的智能和效率，传统静态配置的无线图像传输框架在动态信道条件下难以平衡计算效率、鲁棒性和质量。

Method: 结合关键信息提取和自适应背景合成，利用Mediapipe和Rembg动态分离前景特征并匹配预训练背景库，减少数据负载。

Result: 实验显示，与传统JSCC方法相比，该方法在低信噪比条件下显著提升了峰值信噪比（PSNR）。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的移动通信中的多媒体服务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of 6G networks demands unprecedented levels of intelligence,
adaptability, and efficiency to address challenges such as ultra-high-speed
data transmission, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity in dynamic
environments. Traditional wireless image transmission frameworks, reliant on
static configurations and isolated source-channel coding, struggle to balance
computational efficiency, robustness, and quality under fluctuating channel
conditions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an AI-native deep joint
source-channel coding (JSCC) framework tailored for resource-constrained 6G
networks. Our approach integrates key information extraction and adaptive
background synthesis to enable intelligent, semantic-aware transmission.
Leveraging AI-driven tools, Mediapipe for human pose detection and Rembg for
background removal, the model dynamically isolates foreground features and
matches backgrounds from a pre-trained library, reducing data payloads while
preserving visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared with traditional
JSCC method, especially under low-SNR conditions. This approach offers a
practical solution for multimedia services in resource-constrained mobile
communications.

TL;DR: SwiftWRF利用高斯泼溅技术高效建模无线辐射场，实现快速准确的频谱合成，适用于实时通信任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在无线辐射场建模中精度不足或依赖强场景先验，而基于NeRF的方法因计算量大难以实时部署。

Method: 提出SwiftWRF框架，采用可变形2D高斯泼溅和CUDA加速光栅化，结合轻量级MLP建模变形，实现高效频谱合成。

Result: 实验显示SwiftWRF比现有方法快500倍，信号质量显著提升，适用于AoA和RSSI预测。

Conclusion: SwiftWRF为无线辐射场建模提供了高效解决方案，适用于实时通信和感知任务。

Abstract: Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern
communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and
channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or
physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong
scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve
reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their
reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries
hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in
modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF
reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian
splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under
single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated
rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP
to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing
mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the
efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in
angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor
scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster
than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its
signal quality. Code and datasets will be released.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，SEHR表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SEHR通过结合几何先验和法线图优化，显著提升了单视角3D人体重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-view textured human reconstruction aims to reconstruct a clothed 3D
digital human by inputting a monocular 2D image. Existing approaches include
feed-forward methods, limited by scarce 3D human data, and diffusion-based
methods, prone to erroneous 2D hallucinations. To address these issues, we
propose a novel SMPL normal map Equipped 3D Human Reconstruction (SEHR)
framework, integrating a pretrained large 3D reconstruction model with human
geometry prior. SEHR performs single-view human reconstruction without using a
preset diffusion model in one forward propagation. Concretely, SEHR consists of
two key components: SMPL Normal Map Guidance (SNMG) and SMPL Normal Map
Constraint (SNMC). SNMG incorporates SMPL normal maps into an auxiliary network
to provide improved body shape guidance. SNMC enhances invisible body parts by
constraining the model to predict an extra SMPL normal Gaussians. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEHR outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) datasets have become
the Kernel of Digital Health Research by providing freely accessible,
deidentified records from tens of thousands of critical care admissions,
enabling a broad spectrum of applications in clinical decision support, outcome
prediction, and healthcare analytics. Although numerous studies and surveys

critical challenges in data integration, representation, and interoperability
remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that focuses
uniquely on open problems. We identify persistent issues such as data
granularity, cardinality limitations, heterogeneous coding schemes, and ethical
constraints that hinder the generalizability and real-time implementation of
machine learning models. We highlight key progress in dimensionality reduction,
temporal modelling, causal inference, and privacy preserving analytics, while
also outlining promising directions including hybrid modelling, federated
learning, and standardized preprocessing pipelines. By critically examining
these structural limitations and their implications, this survey offers
actionable insights to guide the next generation of MIMIC powered digital

Conclusion: Rehazy策略有效提升了去雾性能和训练稳定性，为图像去雾领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Overfitting to synthetic training pairs remains a critical challenge in image
dehazing, leading to poor generalization capability to real-world scenarios. To
address this issue, existing approaches utilize unpaired realistic data for
training, employing CycleGAN or contrastive learning frameworks. Despite their
progress, these methods often suffer from training instability, resulting in
limited dehazing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training
strategy for unpaired image dehazing, termed Rehazy, to improve both dehazing
performance and training stability. This strategy explores the consistency of
the underlying clean images across hazy images and utilizes hazy-rehazy pairs
for effective learning of real haze characteristics. To favorably construct
hazy-rehazy pairs, we develop a physics-based rehazy generation pipeline, which
is theoretically validated to reliably produce high-quality rehazy images.
Additionally, leveraging the rehazy strategy, we introduce a dual-branch
framework for dehazing network training, where a clean branch provides a basic
dehazing capability in a synthetic manner, and a hazy branch enhances the
generalization ability with hazy-rehazy pairs. Moreover, we design a new
dehazing network within these branches to improve the efficiency, which
progressively restores clean scenes from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments
on four benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach,
exceeding the previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.58 dB on the SOTS-Indoor
dataset and by 1.85 dB on the SOTS-Outdoor dataset in PSNR. Our code will be
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前剪枝方法通常通过迭代搜索确定最优策略，导致计算开销大，难以适应多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的需求。

Method: LOP训练自回归神经网络（NNs），直接从目标剪枝约束预测分层剪枝策略，无需耗时迭代搜索。

Result: 实验表明，LOP在多项任务中优于现有剪枝方法，且速度提升高达三个数量级。

Conclusion: LOP为MLLMs的高效部署提供了一种快速且性能优越的剪枝解决方案。

Abstract: Structural pruning techniques are essential for deploying multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) across various hardware platforms, from edge devices to
cloud servers. However, current pruning methods typically determine optimal
strategies through iterative search processes, resulting in substantial
computational overhead for on-demand MLLMs adaptation. To address this
challenge, we propose LOP, an efficient neural pruning framework that learns
optimal pruning strategies from the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
need for computationally expensive search-based methods. LOP approach trains
autoregressive neural networks (NNs) to directly predict layer-wise pruning
strategies adaptive to the target pruning constraint, eliminating the
time-consuming iterative searches. Experimental results across multiple tasks
show that LOP outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in various metrics
while achieving up to three orders of magnitude speedup.

Result: 实验证明ComplexBench-Edit能有效区分模型能力，且CoT方法显著提升了复杂编辑任务的表现。

Conclusion: ComplexBench-Edit和CoT方法为复杂图像编辑任务提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing has achieved remarkable success in following single
instructions. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex, multi-step
instructions, particularly ``chain'' instructions where operations are
interdependent. Current models struggle with these intricate directives, and
existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they
often overlook multi-instruction and chain-instruction complexities, and common
consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce
ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model
performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing
tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation
method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based
approach that significantly enhances the ability of existing models to follow
complex instructions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ComplexBench-Edit's
efficacy in differentiating model capabilities and highlight the superior
performance of our CoT-based method in handling complex edits. The data and
code are released at https://github.com/llllly26/ComplexBench-Edit.

Conclusion: DiffS-NOCS通过多视图融合和扩散模型，显著提升了从草图到3D点云的生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: Reconstructing a 3D point cloud from a given conditional sketch is
challenging. Existing methods often work directly in 3D space, but domain
variability and difficulty in reconstructing accurate 3D structures from 2D
sketches remain significant obstacles. Moreover, ideal models should also
accept prompts for control, in addition with the sparse sketch, posing
challenges in multi-modal fusion. We propose DiffS-NOCS (Diffusion-based
Sketch-to-NOCS Map), which leverages ControlNet with a modified multi-view
decoder to generate NOCS maps with embedded 3D structure and position
information in 2D space from sketches. The 3D point cloud is reconstructed by
combining multiple NOCS maps from different views. To enhance sketch
understanding, we integrate a viewpoint encoder for extracting viewpoint
features. Additionally, we design a feature-level multi-view aggregation
network as the denoising module, facilitating cross-view information exchange
and improving 3D consistency in NOCS map generation. Experiments on ShapeNet
demonstrate that DiffS-NOCS achieves controllable and fine-grained point cloud
reconstruction aligned with sketches.

Result: 在三个挑战性CD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HyRet-Change框架有效整合卷积和保留机制，提升了复杂场景下的变化检测能力。

Abstract: Recently convolution and transformer-based change detection (CD) methods
provide promising performance. However, it remains unclear how the local and
global dependencies interact to effectively alleviate the pseudo changes.
Moreover, directly utilizing standard self-attention presents intrinsic
limitations including governing global feature representations limit to capture
subtle changes, quadratic complexity, and restricted training parallelism. To
address these limitations, we propose a Siamese-based framework, called
HyRet-Change, which can seamlessly integrate the merits of convolution and
retention mechanisms at multi-scale features to preserve critical information
and enhance adaptability in complex scenes. Specifically, we introduce a novel
feature difference module to exploit both convolutions and multi-head retention
mechanisms in a parallel manner to capture complementary information.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive local-global interactive context awareness
mechanism that enables mutual learning and enhances discrimination capability
through information exchange. We perform experiments on three challenging CD
datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present our solution to the MiGA Challenge at IJCAI 2025, which aims to
recognize micro-gestures (MGs) from skeleton sequences for the purpose of

three key enhancements: (1) a topology-aware skeleton representation
specifically designed for the iMiGUE dataset to better capture fine-grained
motion patterns; (2) an improved temporal processing strategy that facilitates
smoother and more temporally consistent motion modeling; and (3) the
incorporation of semantic label embeddings as auxiliary supervision to improve
the model generalization. Our method achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 67.01\% on

Conclusion: CAPO框架和Med-Zero-17K数据集有效解决了医学视觉问答中的关键挑战，提升了模型性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), achieving accurate responses
relies on three critical steps: precise perception of medical imaging data,
logical reasoning grounded in visual input and textual questions, and coherent
answer derivation from the reasoning process. Recent advances in general
vision-language models (VLMs) show that large-scale reinforcement learning (RL)
could significantly enhance both reasoning capabilities and overall model
performance. However, their application in medical domains is hindered by two
fundamental challenges: 1) misalignment between perceptual understanding and
reasoning stages, and 2) inconsistency between reasoning pathways and answer
generation, both compounded by the scarcity of high-quality medical datasets
for effective large-scale RL. In this paper, we first introduce Med-Zero-17K, a
curated dataset for pure RL-based training, encompassing over 30 medical image
modalities and 24 clinical tasks. Moreover, we propose a novel large-scale RL
framework for Med-VLMs, Consistency-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which
integrates rewards to ensure fidelity between perception and reasoning,
consistency in reasoning-to-answer derivation, and rule-based accuracy for
final responses. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong VLM baselines,
showcasing strong generalization capability to 3D Med-VQA benchmarks and
R1-like training paradigms.

Abstract: Video object removal and inpainting are critical tasks in the fields of
computer vision and multimedia processing, aimed at restoring missing or
corrupted regions in video sequences. Traditional methods predominantly rely on
flow-based propagation and spatio-temporal Transformers, but these approaches
face limitations in effectively leveraging long-term temporal features and
ensuring temporal consistency in the completion results, particularly when
dealing with large masks. Consequently, performance on extensive masked areas
remains suboptimal. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel
video inpainting approach leveraging the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). DiT
synergistically combines the advantages of diffusion models and transformer
architectures to maintain long-term temporal consistency while ensuring
high-quality inpainting results. We propose a Circular Position-Shift strategy
to further enhance long-term temporal consistency during the inference stage.
Additionally, the proposed method automatically detects objects within videos,
interactively removes specified objects, and generates corresponding prompts.
In terms of processing speed, it takes only 180 seconds (testing on one NVIDIA
A100 GPU) to complete a video with a resolution of $1080 \times 1920$ with 121
frames without any acceleration method. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed method demonstrates superior performance in content fidelity, texture
restoration, and temporal consistency. Project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著恢复了对抗图像上的伪造定位性能，且对原始伪造图像性能几乎无影响。

Conclusion: 这是首次在图像伪造定位任务中实现对抗防御的研究，具有开创性意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly propelled the development
of image forgery localization. However, existing models remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks: imperceptible noise added to forged images
can severely mislead these models. In this paper, we address this challenge
with an Adversarial Noise Suppression Module (ANSM) that generate a defensive
perturbation to suppress the attack effect of adversarial noise. We observe
that forgery-relevant features extracted from adversarial and original forged
images exhibit distinct distributions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Forgery-relevant Features Alignment (FFA) as a first-stage training strategy,
which reduces distributional discrepancies by minimizing the channel-wise
Kullback-Leibler divergence between these features. To further refine the
defensive perturbation, we design a second-stage training strategy, termed
Mask-guided Refinement (MgR), which incorporates a dual-mask constraint. MgR
ensures that the perturbation remains effective for both adversarial and
original forged images, recovering forgery localization accuracy to their
original level. Extensive experiments across various attack algorithms
demonstrate that our method significantly restores the forgery localization
model's performance on adversarial images. Notably, when ANSM is applied to
original forged images, the performance remains nearly unaffected. To our best
knowledge, this is the first report of adversarial defense in image forgery
localization tasks. We have released the source code and anti-forensics
dataset.

Abstract: Adversarial examples have attracted significant attention over the years, yet
understanding their frequency-based characteristics remains insufficient. In
this paper, we investigate the intriguing properties of adversarial examples in
the frequency domain for the image classification task, with the following key
findings. (1) As the high-frequency components increase, the performance gap
between adversarial and natural examples becomes increasingly pronounced. (2)
The model performance against filtered adversarial examples initially increases
to a peak and declines to its inherent robustness. (3) In Convolutional Neural
Networks, mid- and high-frequency components of adversarial examples exhibit
their attack capabilities, while in Transformers, low- and mid-frequency
components of adversarial examples are particularly effective. These results
suggest that different network architectures have different frequency
preferences and that differences in frequency components between adversarial
and natural examples may directly influence model robustness. Based on our
findings, we further conclude with three useful proposals that serve as a
valuable reference to the AI model security community.

Abstract: Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite
time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely
on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons,
where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and
precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable.
Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such
approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by
ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple,
model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD),
based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time.
By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain,
the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing
temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year
Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season
and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our
method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically,
produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in
low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season
classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses
the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty
estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a
baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging
temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but
also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in
real-world applications.

*Taiga Hayami,Kakeru Koizumi,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构保持块（SPPs）的神经视频表示方法，通过重新排列帧为空间结构化的块帧，以平衡紧凑性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀块划分在块边界处可能导致不连续性，影响全局结构一致性。

Method: 使用类似PixelUnshuffle的操作将帧重新排列为空间结构化的块帧，网络学习预测这些块帧，支持全局到局部的拟合策略。

Result: 在标准视频数据集上，该方法在重建质量和压缩性能上优于现有基于INR的视频表示方法。

Conclusion: SPPs方法有效解决了块边界不连续性问题，提升了视频表示的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have attracted significant interest
for their ability to model complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal
coordinates to signal values. In the context of neural video representation,
several decoding strategies have been explored to balance compactness and
reconstruction quality, including pixel-wise, frame-wise, and patch-wise
methods. Patch-wise decoding aims to combine the flexibility of pixel-based
models with the efficiency of frame-based approaches. However, conventional
uniform patch division often leads to discontinuities at patch boundaries, as
independently reconstructed regions may fail to form a coherent global
structure. To address this limitation, we propose a neural video representation
method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs). Our approach rearranges
each frame into a set of spatially structured patch frames using a
PixelUnshuffle-like operation. This rearrangement maintains the spatial
coherence of the original frame while enabling patch-level decoding. The
network learns to predict these rearranged patch frames, which supports a
global-to-local fitting strategy and mitigates degradation caused by
upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets show that the proposed
method improves reconstruction quality and compression performance compared to
existing INR-based video representation methods.

*Hyunjin Kim,Haebeom Jung,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Metropolis-Hastings的自适应采样框架，用于3D高斯泼溅，通过多视角光度误差信号动态调整高斯分布，减少冗余计算和启发式依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法依赖启发式密度控制机制（如克隆、分裂和修剪），可能导致冗余计算或过早移除有用高斯分布。

Method: 将密度控制和修剪重新定义为概率采样过程，基于多视角误差和不透明度分数动态插入和重定位高斯分布，利用贝叶斯接受测试指导。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实验表明，该方法减少了所需高斯分布数量，提升了计算效率，同时保持或略微超越现有模型的视图合成质量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应采样减少了启发式依赖，提高了灵活性和效率，适用于无需预定义场景复杂度的3D高斯泼溅任务。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a
unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Traditional 3DGS methods heavily rely on
heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and
pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or the premature removal of
beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by
reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process,
dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view
errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from
these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance
on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian
distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on
benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep
Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed,
enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the
view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于血管结构细长、低对比度且复杂，传统CNN和ViT在保持拓扑连续性和边界精度方面存在不足。

Method: 提出BAVT，一种基于ViT的架构，结合边缘感知损失，专注于精细血管边界分割，并保持与大规模视觉基础模型预训练的兼容性。

Result: 在DCA-1数据集上，BAVT在医学图像分割指标上表现优于CNN和混合基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合普通ViT编码器和边界感知监督，BAVT实现了临床级血管分割的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular structures in coronary angiography remains
a core challenge in medical image analysis due to the complexity of elongated,
thin, and low-contrast vessels. Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
often fail to preserve topological continuity, while recent Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based models, although strong in global context modeling, lack precise
boundary awareness. In this work, we introduce BAVT, a Boundary-Aware Vision
Transformer, a ViT-based architecture enhanced with an edge-aware loss that
explicitly guides the segmentation toward fine-grained vascular boundaries.
Unlike hybrid transformer-CNN models, BAVT retains a minimal, scalable
structure that is fully compatible with large-scale vision foundation model
(VFM) pretraining. We validate our approach on the DCA-1 coronary angiography
dataset, where BAVT achieves superior performance across medical image
segmentation metrics outperforming both CNN and hybrid baselines. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining plain ViT encoders with
boundary-aware supervision for clinical-grade vascular segmentation.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of transformers in medical applications, the
exploration of multi-scale learning through transformers remains limited, while
hierarchical representations are considered advantageous for computer-aided
medical diagnosis. We propose a novel hierarchical transformer model that
adeptly integrates the feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) with the advanced representational potential of Vision
Transformers (ViTs). Addressing the lack of inductive biases and dependence on
extensive training datasets in ViTs, our model employs a CNN backbone to
generate hierarchical visual representations. These representations are adapted
for transformer input through an innovative patch tokenization process,
preserving the inherited multi-scale inductive biases. We also introduce a
scale-wise attention mechanism that directly captures intra-scale and
inter-scale associations. This mechanism complements patch-wise attention by
enhancing spatial understanding and preserving global perception, which we
refer to as local and global attention, respectively. Our model significantly
outperforms baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, demonstrating
its efficiency in bridging the gap between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The components are designed as plug-and-play
for different CNN architectures and can be adapted for multiple applications.

Conclusion: SmartHome-Bench为智能家居VAD提供了首个全面基准，TRLC框架显著提升了模型性能，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is essential for enhancing safety and security
by identifying unusual events across different environments. Existing VAD
benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios,
neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge
this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark
specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the
capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Our newly proposed
benchmark consists of 1,203 videos recorded by smart home cameras, organized
according to a novel anomaly taxonomy that includes seven categories, such as
Wildlife, Senior Care, and Baby Monitoring. Each video is meticulously
annotated with anomaly tags, detailed descriptions, and reasoning. We further
investigate adaptation methods for MLLMs in VAD, assessing state-of-the-art
closed-source and open-source models with various prompting techniques. Results
reveal significant limitations in the current models' ability to detect video
anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Taxonomy-Driven Reflective LLM Chain (TRLC), a new LLM chaining framework that
achieves a notable 11.62% improvement in detection accuracy. The benchmark
dataset and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 目前缺乏基于Transformer的实时多人姿态估计模型，限制了其在计算机视觉和虚拟现实中的应用。

Method: 采用改进的解码器架构和关键点相似性度量，生成正负查询以优化模型性能。

Result: 模型训练速度显著提升（减少5-10倍训练周期），推理时间具有竞争力，且无需量化库加速，性能优于或接近现有模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为实时多人姿态估计提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE) estimates keypoints for all individuals
present in an image. MPPE is a fundamental task for several applications in
computer vision and virtual reality. Unfortunately, there are currently no
transformer-based models that can perform MPPE in real time. The paper presents
a family of transformer-based models capable of performing multi-person 2D pose
estimation in real-time. Our approach utilizes a modified decoder architecture
and keypoint similarity metrics to generate both positive and negative queries,
thereby enhancing the quality of the selected queries within the architecture.
Compared to state-of-the-art models, our proposed models train much faster,
using 5 to 10 times fewer epochs, with competitive inference times without
requiring quantization libraries to speed up the model. Furthermore, our
proposed models provide competitive results or outperform alternative models,
often using significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: WildCAT3D是一个从多样化的2D场景图像数据中学习生成新视角的框架，解决了场景级新视角合成的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景级新视角合成缺乏干净的多样化训练数据，而野外数据丰富但存在外观变化问题。

Method: 通过显式建模全局外观条件，扩展多视角扩散范式，从多样化外观的场景视图学习。

Result: WildCAT3D在单视角新视角合成中取得最优结果，且训练数据需求少于现有方法。

Conclusion: WildCAT3D不仅提升了场景级新视角合成的性能，还支持生成时的全局外观控制。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in sparse novel view synthesis (NVS) applied to
object-centric scenes, scene-level NVS remains a challenge. A central issue is
the lack of available clean multi-view training data, beyond manually curated
datasets with limited diversity, camera variation, or licensing issues. On the
other hand, an abundance of diverse and permissively-licensed data exists in
the wild, consisting of scenes with varying appearances (illuminations,
transient occlusions, etc.) from sources such as tourist photos. To this end,
we present WildCAT3D, a framework for generating novel views of scenes learned
from diverse 2D scene image data captured in the wild. We unlock training on
these data sources by explicitly modeling global appearance conditions in
images, extending the state-of-the-art multi-view diffusion paradigm to learn
from scene views of varying appearances. Our trained model generalizes to new
scenes at inference time, enabling the generation of multiple consistent novel
views. WildCAT3D provides state-of-the-art results on single-view NVS in
object- and scene-level settings, while training on strictly less data sources
than prior methods. Additionally, it enables novel applications by providing
global appearance control during generation.

Conclusion: HKD4VLM通过知识蒸馏和增强推理策略，显著提升了模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Driven by the rapid progress in vision-language models (VLMs), the
responsible behavior of large-scale multimodal models has become a prominent
research area, particularly focusing on hallucination detection and factuality
checking. In this paper, we present the solution for the two tracks of
Responsible AI challenge. Inspirations from the general domain demonstrate that
a smaller distilled VLM can often outperform a larger VLM that is directly
tuned on downstream tasks, while achieving higher efficiency. We thus jointly
tackle two tasks from the perspective of knowledge distillation and propose a
progressive hybrid knowledge distillation framework termed HKD4VLM.
Specifically, the overall framework can be decomposed into Pyramid-like
Progressive Online Distillation and Ternary-Coupled Refinement Distillation,
hierarchically moving from coarse-grained knowledge alignment to fine-grained
refinement. Besides, we further introduce the mapping shift-enhanced inference
and diverse augmentation strategies to enhance model performance and
robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
HKD4VLM. Ablation studies provide insights into the critical design choices
driving performance gains.

Motivation: 解决行人重识别中光照、姿态和视角变化带来的挑战，并探索如何通过语义和上下文信息提升性能。

Method: 利用LLMs（如GPT-4o）生成动态身份特定提示，将文本描述作为特权信息融入视觉匹配系统。

Result: 实验表明，文本描述显著提高了准确性，尤其在复杂或模糊场景中。

Conclusion: 通过结合计算机视觉与自然语言处理，本文为未来研究方向（如提示设计、跨模态迁移学习和实际适应性）提供了统一视角。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) has evolved from handcrafted feature-based
methods to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to models incorporating
large language models (LLMs). Early methods struggled with variations in
lighting, pose, and viewpoint, but deep learning addressed these issues by
learning robust visual features. Building on this, LLMs now enable ReID systems
to integrate semantic and contextual information through natural language. This
survey traces that full evolution and offers one of the first comprehensive
reviews of ReID approaches that leverage LLMs, where textual descriptions are
used as privileged information to improve visual matching. A key contribution
is the use of dynamic, identity-specific prompts generated by GPT-4o, which
enhance the alignment between images and text in vision-language ReID systems.
Experimental results show that these descriptions improve accuracy, especially
in complex or ambiguous cases. To support further research, we release a large
set of GPT-4o-generated descriptions for standard ReID datasets. By bridging
computer vision and natural language processing, this survey offers a unified
perspective on the field's development and outlines key future directions such
as better prompt design, cross-modal transfer learning, and real-world
adaptability.

Abstract: We present MAMMA, a markerless motion-capture pipeline that accurately
recovers SMPL-X parameters from multi-view video of two-person interaction
sequences. Traditional motion-capture systems rely on physical markers.
Although they offer high accuracy, their requirements of specialized hardware,
manual marker placement, and extensive post-processing make them costly and
time-consuming. Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome these
limitations, but most are designed for single-person capture, rely on sparse
keypoints, or struggle with occlusions and physical interactions. In this work,
we introduce a method that predicts dense 2D surface landmarks conditioned on
segmentation masks, enabling person-specific correspondence estimation even
under heavy occlusion. We employ a novel architecture that exploits learnable
queries for each landmark. We demonstrate that our approach can handle complex
person--person interaction and offers greater accuracy than existing methods.
To train our network, we construct a large, synthetic multi-view dataset
combining human motions from diverse sources, including extreme poses, hand
motions, and close interactions. Our dataset yields high-variability synthetic
sequences with rich body contact and occlusion, and includes SMPL-X
ground-truth annotations with dense 2D landmarks. The result is a system
capable of capturing human motion without the need for markers. Our approach
offers competitive reconstruction quality compared to commercial marker-based
motion-capture solutions, without the extensive manual cleanup. Finally, we
address the absence of common benchmarks for dense-landmark prediction and
markerless motion capture by introducing two evaluation settings built from
real multi-view sequences. We will release our dataset, benchmark, method,
training code, and pre-trained model weights for research purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决胸部X光诊断中常见的感知错误（如被忽略的可见异常），并提供有意义的人机协作支持。

Method: RADAR系统接收放射科医生的注释和CXR图像，进行区域级分析，提供兴趣区域建议而非固定标签。

Result: 在模拟感知错误数据集上，RADAR的召回率为0.78，精确度为0.44，F1分数为0.56，区域定位准确（中位IoU为0.78）。

Conclusion: RADAR有效补充放射科医生的判断，为CXR解释中的感知错误检测提供有价值的支持，并适合实际工作流程。

Abstract: Chest radiography is widely used in diagnostic imaging. However, perceptual
errors -- especially overlooked but visible abnormalities -- remain common and
clinically significant. Current workflows and AI systems provide limited
support for detecting such errors after interpretation and often lack
meaningful human--AI collaboration. We introduce RADAR (Radiologist--AI
Diagnostic Assistance and Review), a post-interpretation companion system.
RADAR ingests finalized radiologist annotations and CXR images, then performs
regional-level analysis to detect and refer potentially missed abnormal
regions. The system supports a "second-look" workflow and offers suggested
regions of interest (ROIs) rather than fixed labels to accommodate
inter-observer variation. We evaluated RADAR on a simulated perceptual-error
dataset derived from de-identified CXR cases, using F1 score and Intersection
over Union (IoU) as primary metrics. RADAR achieved a recall of 0.78, precision
of 0.44, and an F1 score of 0.56 in detecting missed abnormalities in the
simulated perceptual-error dataset. Although precision is moderate, this
reduces over-reliance on AI by encouraging radiologist oversight in human--AI
collaboration. The median IoU was 0.78, with more than 90% of referrals
exceeding 0.5 IoU, indicating accurate regional localization. RADAR effectively
complements radiologist judgment, providing valuable post-read support for
perceptual-error detection in CXR interpretation. Its flexible ROI suggestions
and non-intrusive integration position it as a promising tool in real-world
radiology workflows. To facilitate reproducibility and further evaluation, we
release a fully open-source web implementation alongside a simulated error
dataset. All code, data, demonstration videos, and the application are publicly
available at https://github.com/avutukuri01/RADAR.

Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires
benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical
constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two
physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative
models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given
radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial
interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits
all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across
stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with
crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations.
Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and
density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and
(iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid
space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically
informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability
in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: DualFast通过双误差解耦策略，为DPMs提供了一种高效且通用的加速解决方案，进一步推动了快速采样技术的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved impressive success in
visual generation. While, they suffer from slow inference speed due to
iterative sampling. Employing fewer sampling steps is an intuitive solution,
but this will also introduces discretization error. Existing fast samplers make
inspiring efforts to reduce discretization error through the adoption of
high-order solvers, potentially reaching a plateau in terms of optimization.
This raises the question: can the sampling process be accelerated further? In
this paper, we re-examine the nature of sampling errors, discerning that they
comprise two distinct elements: the widely recognized discretization error and
the less explored approximation error. Our research elucidates the dynamics
between these errors and the step by implementing a dual-error disentanglement
strategy. Building on these foundations, we introduce an unified and
training-free acceleration framework, DualFast, designed to enhance the speed
of DPM sampling by concurrently accounting for both error types, thereby
minimizing the total sampling error. DualFast is seamlessly compatible with
existing samplers and significantly boost their sampling quality and speed,
particularly in extremely few sampling steps. We substantiate the effectiveness
of our framework through comprehensive experiments, spanning both unconditional
and conditional sampling domains, across both pixel-space and latent-space
DPMs.

TL;DR: PRISM2是一种多模态病理学基础模型，通过临床对话训练，提升了病理AI的通用性和可扩展性，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理学基础模型缺乏全切片图像理解和大规模诊断数据训练，限制了其在下游任务中的表现。

Method: PRISM2采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过对比和描述目标训练视觉语言模型，第二阶段解冻语言模型以支持临床对话并提取更具临床意义的表示。

Result: PRISM2在诊断和生物标志物预测任务中表现优异，超越PRISM和TITAN等模型，并引入零样本分类方法。

Conclusion: PRISM2通过视觉特征与临床推理的对齐，提升了通用性，为病理AI的广泛应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent pathology foundation models can provide rich tile-level
representations but fall short of delivering general-purpose clinical utility
without further extensive model development. These models lack whole-slide
image (WSI) understanding and are not trained with large-scale diagnostic data,
limiting their performance on diverse downstream tasks. We introduce PRISM2, a
multi-modal slide-level foundation model trained via clinical dialogue to
enable scalable, generalizable pathology AI. PRISM2 is trained on nearly
700,000 specimens (2.3 million WSIs) paired with real-world clinical diagnostic
reports in a two-stage process. In Stage 1, a vision-language model is trained
using contrastive and captioning objectives to align whole slide embeddings
with textual clinical diagnosis. In Stage 2, the language model is unfrozen to
enable diagnostic conversation and extract more clinically meaningful
representations from hidden states. PRISM2 achieves strong performance on
diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level
models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no
classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning
or class enumeration. By aligning visual features with clinical reasoning,
PRISM2 improves generalization on both data-rich and low-sample tasks, offering
a scalable path forward for building general pathology AI agents capable of
assisting diagnostic and prognostic decisions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的视频个体计数（VIC）方法OMAN，通过将一对一匹配（O2O）放宽为一对多匹配（O2M），提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统VIC方法采用一对一匹配策略，对行人外观变化或漏检敏感，限制了性能。

Method: 提出OMAN模型，通过隐式上下文生成器和一对多匹配器，实现更灵活的匹配。

Result: 在SenseCrowd和CroHD基准测试中，OMAN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: OMAN通过一对多匹配策略，更好地适应了VIC任务的需求，提升了计数准确性。

Abstract: Video Individual Counting (VIC) is a recently introduced task that aims to
estimate pedestrian flux from a video. It extends conventional Video Crowd
Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that
only learns to count repeated pedestrian patterns across frames, the key
problem of VIC is how to identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which
turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however,
mainly follow a one-to-one (O2O) matching strategy where the same pedestrian
must be exactly matched between frames, leading to sensitivity to appearance
variations or missing detections. In this work, we show that the O2O matching
could be relaxed to a one-to-many (O2M) matching problem, which better fits the
problem nature of VIC and can leverage the social grouping behavior of walking
pedestrians. We therefore introduce OMAN, a simple but effective VIC model with
implicit One-to-Many mAtchiNg, featuring an implicit context generator and a
one-to-many pairwise matcher. Experiments on the SenseCrowd and CroHD
benchmarks show that OMAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code is

TL;DR: 论文提出SuperPlace方法，结合经典特征聚合技术（如GeM和NetVLAD）与监督标签对齐，显著提升了视觉地点识别（VPR）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法未能充分利用基础模型（FM）的潜力，且忽视了经典聚合方法的优势。

Method: 1. 提出监督标签对齐方法，统一多数据集训练框架；2. 设计G²M聚合方法，结合双GeM优化特征；3. 提出NetVLAD-Linear的二次微调策略（FT²）。

Result: G²M在特征维度减少90%的情况下表现优异；NVL-FT²在MSLS排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: SuperPlace通过结合经典方法与创新策略，显著提升了VPR性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent visual place recognition (VPR) approaches have leveraged foundation
models (FM) and introduced novel aggregation techniques. However, these methods
have failed to fully exploit key concepts of FM, such as the effective
utilization of extensive training sets, and they have overlooked the potential
of classical aggregation methods, such as GeM and NetVLAD. Building on these
insights, we revive classical feature aggregation methods and develop more
fundamental VPR models, collectively termed SuperPlace. First, we introduce a
supervised label alignment method that enables training across various VPR
datasets within a unified framework. Second, we propose G$^2$M, a compact
feature aggregation method utilizing two GeMs, where one GeM learns the
principal components of feature maps along the channel dimension and calibrates
the output of the other. Third, we propose the secondary fine-tuning (FT$^2$)
strategy for NetVLAD-Linear (NVL). NetVLAD first learns feature vectors in a
high-dimensional space and then compresses them into a lower-dimensional space
via a single linear layer. Extensive experiments highlight our contributions
and demonstrate the superiority of SuperPlace. Specifically, G$^2$M achieves
promising results with only one-tenth of the feature dimensions compared to
recent methods. Moreover, NVL-FT$^2$ ranks first on the MSLS leaderboard.

TL;DR: SuperPoint-SLAM3通过替换ORB为自监督的SuperPoint检测器-描述符，结合自适应非极大抑制和轻量级NetVLAD模块，显著提升了ORB-SLAM3在极端条件下的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORB-SLAM3在极端视角、尺度和光照变化下表现不佳，因其依赖手工设计的ORB关键点。

Method: 引入SuperPoint检测器-描述符，使用自适应非极大抑制（ANMS）确保关键点均匀分布，并集成NetVLAD模块进行学习式闭环检测。

Result: 在KITTI和EuRoC数据集上，SuperPoint-SLAM3显著降低了平移和旋转误差，例如KITTI平移误差从4.15%降至0.34%。

Conclusion: 结合现代深度特征和学习式闭环模块，SuperPoint-SLAM3显著提升了ORB-SLAM3的精度，同时保持实时性。

Abstract: Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) must remain accurate
under extreme viewpoint, scale and illumination variations. The widely adopted
ORB-SLAM3 falters in these regimes because it relies on hand-crafted ORB
keypoints. We introduce SuperPoint-SLAM3, a drop-in upgrade that (i) replaces
ORB with the self-supervised SuperPoint detector--descriptor, (ii) enforces
spatially uniform keypoints via adaptive non-maximal suppression (ANMS), and
(iii) integrates a lightweight NetVLAD place-recognition head for
learning-based loop closure.
  On the KITTI Odometry benchmark SuperPoint-SLAM3 reduces mean translational
error from 4.15% to 0.34% and mean rotational error from 0.0027 deg/m to 0.0010
deg/m. On the EuRoC MAV dataset it roughly halves both errors across every
sequence (e.g., V2\_03: 1.58% -> 0.79%). These gains confirm that fusing modern
deep features with a learned loop-closure module markedly improves ORB-SLAM3
accuracy while preserving its real-time operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测方法因缺乏密集帧级标注，导致事件定位不完整。

Method: LEC-VAD采用双结构编码类别相关和类别无关语义，利用异常感知高斯混合学习事件边界，并通过记忆库原型学习机制增强文本描述。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LEC-VAD通过结合视觉与语言语义及事件完整性学习，显著提升了弱监督视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) is tasked with pinpointing
temporal intervals containing anomalous events within untrimmed videos,
utilizing only video-level annotations. However, a significant challenge arises
due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to
incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we
present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised
Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode
both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and
language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an
anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby
yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory
bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions
associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's
expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates
remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two
benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.

Result: 在多类无监督异常检测任务中，Pro-AD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Pro-AD通过优化原型利用和约束机制，显著提升了异常检测的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Prototype-based reconstruction methods for unsupervised anomaly detection
utilize a limited set of learnable prototypes which only aggregates
insufficient normal information, resulting in undesirable reconstruction.
However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well
reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft
Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these
issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly
detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable
prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we
employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the
normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via
prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more
comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image
features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its
contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive
prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well
reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention
mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within
the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further
improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art
performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness
for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高反射物体的3D建模因强视角依赖性而具有挑战性，现有SDF方法耗时且易产生过度平滑表面，而3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽快速但缺乏几何约束导致表面提取噪声大。

Method: 结合2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）的快速渲染能力和基础模型的几何信息，提出GS-2DGS方法。

Conclusion: GS-2DGS成功结合了高斯泼溅的速度和几何约束，为高反射物体建模提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D modeling of highly reflective objects remains challenging due to strong
view-dependent appearances. While previous SDF-based methods can recover
high-quality meshes, they are often time-consuming and tend to produce
over-smoothed surfaces. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers the
advantage of high speed and detailed real-time rendering, but extracting
surfaces from the Gaussians can be noisy due to the lack of geometric
constraints. To bridge the gap between these approaches, we propose a novel
reconstruction method called GS-2DGS for reflective objects based on 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Our approach combines the rapid rendering
capabilities of Gaussian Splatting with additional geometric information from
foundation models. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Gaussian-based techniques
in terms of reconstruction and relighting and achieves performance comparable
to SDF-based methods while being an order of magnitude faster. Code is

Conclusion: ZINA为多模态幻觉的细粒度检测与编辑提供了有效解决方案，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate hallucinations, where
the output deviates from the visual content. Given that these hallucinations
can take diverse forms, detecting hallucinations at a fine-grained level is
essential for comprehensive evaluation and analysis. To this end, we propose a
novel task of multimodal fine-grained hallucination detection and editing for
MLLMs. Moreover, we propose ZINA, a novel method that identifies hallucinated
spans at a fine-grained level, classifies their error types into six
categories, and suggests appropriate refinements. To train and evaluate models
for this task, we constructed VisionHall, a dataset comprising 6.9k outputs
from twelve MLLMs manually annotated by 211 annotators, and 20k synthetic
samples generated using a graph-based method that captures dependencies among
error types. We demonstrated that ZINA outperformed existing methods, including
GPT-4o and LLama-3.2, in both detection and editing tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且轻量，显著提升VPR性能，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a scene-oriented image retrieval problem in
computer vision in which re-ranking based on local features is commonly
employed to improve performance. In robotics, VPR is also referred to as Loop
Closure Detection, which emphasizes spatial-temporal verification within a
sequence. However, designing local features specifically for VPR is
impractical, and relying on motion sequences imposes limitations. Inspired by
these observations, we propose a novel, simple re-ranking method that refines
global features through a Mixture-of-Features (MoF) approach under embodied
constraints. First, we analyze the practical feasibility of embodied
constraints in VPR and categorize them according to existing datasets, which
include GPS tags, sequential timestamps, local feature matching, and
self-similarity matrices. We then propose a learning-based MoF
weight-computation approach, utilizing a multi-metric loss function.
Experiments demonstrate that our method improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on public datasets with minimal additional computational overhead.
For instance, with only 25 KB of additional parameters and a processing time of
10 microseconds per frame, our method achieves a 0.9\% improvement over a
DINOv2-based baseline performance on the Pitts-30k test set.

Conclusion: STAGE通过HTFT和多阶段训练策略，显著提升了长时程驾驶视频生成的性能，展示了生成无限长度视频的潜力。

Abstract: The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over
extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world
modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature
misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and
limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these
limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine),
a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature
coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To
achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce
Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training
strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout
the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process
separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage
training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model
decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby
accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on
the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing
methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also
explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We
generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset,
which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

Conclusion: StgcDiff通过捕捉手语的独特时空依赖关系，能够生成平滑且语义准确的过渡视频。

Abstract: Sign language transition generation seeks to convert discrete sign language
segments into continuous sign videos by synthesizing smooth transitions.
However,most existing methods merely concatenate isolated signs, resulting in
poor visual coherence and semantic accuracy in the generated videos. Unlike
textual languages,sign language is inherently rich in spatial-temporal cues,
making it more complex to model. To address this,we propose StgcDiff, a
graph-based conditional diffusion framework that generates smooth transitions
between discrete signs by capturing the unique spatial-temporal dependencies of
sign language. Specifically, we first train an encoder-decoder architecture to
learn a structure-aware representation of spatial-temporal skeleton sequences.
Next, we optimize a diffusion denoiser conditioned on the representations
learned by the pre-trained encoder, which is tasked with predicting transition
frames from noise. Additionally, we design the Sign-GCN module as the key
component in our framework, which effectively models the spatial-temporal
features. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T, USTC-CSL100,and
USTC-SLR500 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: Although Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in image understanding tasks, their computational efficiency
remains a significant challenge, particularly on resource-constrained devices
due to the high cost of processing large numbers of visual tokens. Recently,
training-free visual token pruning methods have gained popularity as a low-cost
solution to this issue. However, existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: semantic saliency-based strategies primarily focus on high
cross-attention visual tokens, often neglecting visual diversity, whereas
visual diversity-based methods risk inadvertently discarding semantically
important tokens, especially under high compression ratios. In this paper, we
introduce GreedyPrune, a training-free plug-and-play visual token pruning
algorithm designed to jointly optimize semantic saliency and visual diversity.
We formalize the token pruning process as a combinatorial optimization problem
and demonstrate that greedy algorithms effectively balance computational
efficiency with model accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing that GreedyPrune achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy across various multimodal tasks and models while
significantly reducing end-to-end inference latency.

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision
and robotics. Most existing learning-based PCR methods rely on Transformers,
which suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This limitation restricts
the resolution of point clouds that can be processed, inevitably leading to
information loss. In contrast, Mamba-a recently proposed model based on state
space models (SSMs)-achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining
strong long-range contextual modeling capabilities. However, directly applying
Mamba to PCR tasks yields suboptimal performance due to the unordered and
irregular nature of point cloud data. To address this challenge, we propose
MT-PCR, the first point cloud registration framework that integrates both Mamba
and Transformer modules. Specifically, we serialize point cloud features using
Z-order space-filling curves to enforce spatial locality, enabling Mamba to
better model the geometric structure of the input. Additionally, we remove the
order indicator module commonly used in Mamba-based sequence modeling, leads to
improved performance in our setting. The serialized features are then processed
by an optimized Mamba encoder, followed by a Transformer refinement stage.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MT-PCR
outperforms Transformer-based and concurrent state-of-the-art methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, significantly reducing while GPU memory usage and
FLOPs.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

TL;DR: DVP-MVS++ 是一种结合深度-法线-边缘对齐和跨视图先验的改进方法，用于解决多视角立体视觉中的边缘跳过和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于块变形的方法在多视角立体视觉中表现良好，但忽视了边缘跳过和遮挡导致的变形不稳定问题。

Method: 通过深度、法线和边缘图对齐生成精细边界，并利用可见性图和跨视图深度重投影优化块变形。

Result: 在 ETH3D、Tanks & Temples 和 Strecha 数据集上表现出最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: DVP-MVS++ 通过几何一致性和可见性感知显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Recently, patch deformation-based methods have demonstrated significant
effectiveness in multi-view stereo due to their incorporation of deformable and
expandable perception for reconstructing textureless areas. However, these
methods generally focus on identifying reliable pixel correlations to mitigate
matching ambiguity of patch deformation, while neglecting the deformation
instability caused by edge-skipping and visibility occlusions, which may cause
potential estimation deviations. To address these issues, we propose DVP-MVS++,
an innovative approach that synergizes both depth-normal-edge aligned and
harmonized cross-view priors for robust and visibility-aware patch deformation.
Specifically, to avoid edge-skipping, we first apply DepthPro, Metric3Dv2 and
Roberts operator to generate coarse depth maps, normal maps and edge maps,
respectively. These maps are then aligned via an erosion-dilation strategy to
produce fine-grained homogeneous boundaries for facilitating robust patch
deformation. Moreover, we reformulate view selection weights as visibility
maps, and then implement both an enhanced cross-view depth reprojection and an
area-maximization strategy to help reliably restore visible areas and
effectively balance deformed patch, thus acquiring harmonized cross-view priors
for visibility-aware patch deformation. Additionally, we obtain geometry
consistency by adopting both aggregated normals via view selection and
projection depth differences via epipolar lines, and then employ SHIQ for
highlight correction to enable geometry consistency with highlight-aware
perception, thus improving reconstruction quality during propagation and
refinement stage. Evaluation results on ETH3D, Tanks & Temples and Strecha
datasets exhibit the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization
capability of our proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SASep的方法，通过语义分解和几何合成策略，提升3D开放集识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集识别方法依赖全局特征，忽略物体不同部分的语义重要性，限制了识别未知类别的能力。

Method: SASep包括三个模块：可调语义分解（TSD）、几何合成策略（GSS）和合成辅助边界分离（SMS），分别用于语义分解、生成伪未知对象和增强特征分离。

Result: 实验表明SASep在3D开放集识别中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SASep通过改进几何和特征表示，有效提升了模型区分已知和未知类别的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced 3D object
recognition, but most models are limited to closed-set scenarios, unable to
handle unknown samples in real-world applications. Open-set recognition (OSR)
addresses this limitation by enabling models to both classify known classes and
identify novel classes. However, current OSR methods rely on global features to
differentiate known and unknown classes, treating the entire object uniformly
and overlooking the varying semantic importance of its different parts. To
address this gap, we propose Salience-Aware Structured Separation (SASep),
which includes (i) a tunable semantic decomposition (TSD) module to
semantically decompose objects into important and unimportant parts, (ii) a
geometric synthesis strategy (GSS) to generate pseudo-unknown objects by
combining these unimportant parts, and (iii) a synth-aided margin separation
(SMS) module to enhance feature-level separation by expanding the feature
distributions between classes. Together, these components improve both
geometric and feature representations, enhancing the model's ability to
effectively distinguish known and unknown classes. Experimental results show
that SASep achieves superior performance in 3D OSR, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了高频细节缺失问题，为3D人脸重建提供了更高质量的纹理生成方案。

Abstract: Facial texture generation is crucial for high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction
from a single image. However, existing methods struggle to generate UV albedo
maps with high-frequency details. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
end-to-end coarse-to-fine approach for UV albedo map generation. Our method
first utilizes a UV Albedo Parametric Model (UVAPM), driven by low-dimensional
coefficients, to generate coarse albedo maps with skin tones and low-frequency
texture details. To capture high-frequency details, we train a detail generator
using a decoupled albedo map dataset, producing high-resolution albedo maps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity
textures from a single image, outperforming existing methods in terms of
texture quality and realism. The code and pre-trained model are publicly
available at https://github.com/MVIC-DAI/UVAPM, facilitating reproducibility
and further research.

TL;DR: COME框架通过分离自车运动与场景动态，利用场景中心坐标系提升自动驾驶世界模型的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以区分自车运动与场景动态，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: COME通过场景中心预测分支生成与自车无关的未来特征，并通过ControlNet转换为场景条件，注入占用世界模型。

Result: 在nuScenes-Occ3D数据集上，COME比SOTA方法（如DOME和UniScene）分别提升26.3%和23.7%的mIoU指标。

Conclusion: 解耦表示学习显著提升了世界模型的时空预测能力。

Abstract: World models are critical for autonomous driving to simulate environmental
dynamics and generate synthetic data. Existing methods struggle to disentangle
ego-vehicle motion (perspective shifts) from scene evolvement (agent
interactions), leading to suboptimal predictions. Instead, we propose to
separate environmental changes from ego-motion by leveraging the scene-centric
coordinate systems. In this paper, we introduce COME: a framework that
integrates scene-centric forecasting Control into the Occupancy world ModEl.
Specifically, COME first generates ego-irrelevant, spatially consistent future
features through a scene-centric prediction branch, which are then converted
into scene condition using a tailored ControlNet. These condition features are
subsequently injected into the occupancy world model, enabling more accurate
and controllable future occupancy predictions. Experimental results on the
nuScenes-Occ3D dataset show that COME achieves consistent and significant
improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse
configurations, including different input sources (ground-truth, camera-based,
fusion-based occupancy) and prediction horizons (3s and 8s). For example, under
the same settings, COME achieves 26.3% better mIoU metric than DOME and 23.7%
better mIoU metric than UniScene. These results highlight the efficacy of
disentangled representation learning in enhancing spatio-temporal prediction
fidelity for world models. Code and videos will be available at

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在开放世界中可能遇到未知物体类别，而现有LiDAR全景分割模型基于封闭集假设，无法检测未知物体实例。

Method: ULOPS采用三个解码器分别处理语义分割（含不确定性估计）、嵌入与原型关联、实例中心预测，并引入三种不确定性驱动的损失函数以区分已知与未知物体。

Result: 在KITTI-360和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，ULOPS显著优于现有开放集LiDAR全景分割方法。

Conclusion: ULOPS通过不确定性建模和损失函数设计，有效解决了开放环境中的未知物体检测问题。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter
previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic
segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown
object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided
open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based
evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture
incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty
estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center
prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and
segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate
between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss
functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown
regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference
in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale.
Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level.
To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and
introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR
panoptic segmentation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了钢屑回收中的杂质检测问题。

Abstract: Recycling steel scrap can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the
steel industry. However, a significant challenge in steel scrap recycling is
the inclusion of impurities other than steel. To address this issue, we propose
vision-language-model-based anomaly detection where a model is finetuned in a
supervised manner, enabling it to handle niche objects effectively. This model
enables automated detection of anomalies at a fine-grained level within steel
scrap. Specifically, we finetune the image encoder, equipped with multi-scale
mechanism and text prompts aligned with both normal and anomaly images. The
finetuning process trains these modules using a multiclass classification as
the supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在亚毫米级精度、广泛初始姿态估计下的鲁棒性或手动关键点标注方面存在不足，需改进。

Method: 采用多视角、基于轮廓的迭代最近点（ICP）优化，匹配骨亚结构轮廓而非整个轮廓，减少模糊性。

Result: 在真实X射线图像上评估，平均重投影误差（mRPD）为0.67mm，优于需手动干预的商业方案（5.35mm）。

Conclusion: 该方法为骨科手术提供了一种实用、精确且高效的多视角X射线/CT配准解决方案，可提升术中导航效果。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate intraoperative X-ray/CT registration is essential for
surgical navigation in orthopedic procedures. However, existing methods
struggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under
broad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work
aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT
registration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed
registration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest
point (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone
contours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on
matching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone
substructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in
a more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only
two X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute
a dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image
poses and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method
is evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The
method consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm
compared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.
Furthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully
automatic. Conclusion: Our method offers a practical, accurate, and efficient
solution for multi-view X-ray/CT registration in orthopedic surgeries, which
can be easily combined with tracking systems. By improving registration
accuracy and minimizing manual intervention, it enhances intraoperative
navigation, contributing to more accurate and effective surgical outcomes in
computer-assisted surgery (CAS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA)的方法，用于解决扩散式文本到图像（T2I）模型中的社会偏见问题，同时避免非目标属性的意外改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在生成高质量图像时，常表现出与社会偏见相关的性别、种族和社会经济地位等问题，强化了有害的刻板印象。现有的偏见缓解方法存在属性纠缠问题，即调整目标属性时会意外改变非目标属性。

Method: 提出了Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA)方法，通过随机采样目标属性并调整选定层的交叉注意力，确保目标属性的公平分布，同时保留非目标属性。

Result: 实验表明，EFA在缓解偏见的同时，优于现有方法，且保持了原始模型的输出分布和生成能力。

Conclusion: EFA有效解决了属性纠缠问题，为T2I模型的公平性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have
enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text
descriptions. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender,
race, and socioeconomic status, thereby reinforcing harmful stereotypes and
shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation
methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement,
where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes)
unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target
attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this
challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that
accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, Asian, and
Indian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background details)
during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target
attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected
layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of
target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms
existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes,
thereby maintaining the output distribution and generation capability of the
original model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点基图像编辑方法效率低或无法捕捉语义关系，而预训练扩散模型的编辑能力未被充分利用。

Method: 利用DDIM反演过程中U-Net模块自注意力机制学习到的潜在相关性知识，自动调整相关图像区域，并生成自适应掩码指导编辑。

Result: 性能超越现有方法，速度显著更快，提供高效且语义一致的编辑方案。

Conclusion: AttentionDrag为点基图像编辑提供了一种高效、语义一致的新方法。

Abstract: Traditional point-based image editing methods rely on iterative latent
optimization or geometric transformations, which are either inefficient in
their processing or fail to capture the semantic relationships within the
image. These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image
editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we
propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag,
which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within
pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables
semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for
extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent
correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net
module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust
relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency.
Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing
process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly
interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most
state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more
efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing
tasks.

Method: 采用多种微调策略（如全模型微调和LoRA），分别优化UNet扩散主干和文本编码器，并结合多种指标评估生成质量。

Result: 混合微调策略表现最佳：UNet全微调捕捉SAR低层特征，文本编码器部分微调保持提示对齐。

Conclusion: 为将基础模型适应于非自然图像领域提供了系统方法。

Abstract: This work investigates the adaptation of large pre-trained latent diffusion
models to a radically new imaging domain: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While
these generative models, originally trained on natural images, demonstrate
impressive capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, they are not natively
adapted to represent SAR data, which involves different physics, statistical
distributions, and visual characteristics. Using a sizeable SAR dataset (on the
order of 100,000 to 1 million images), we address the fundamental question of
fine-tuning such models for this unseen modality. We explore and compare
multiple fine-tuning strategies, including full model fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient approaches like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), focusing
separately on the UNet diffusion backbone and the text encoder components. To
evaluate generative quality, we combine several metrics: statistical distance
from real SAR distributions, textural similarity via GLCM descriptors, and
semantic alignment assessed with a CLIP model fine-tuned on SAR data. Our
results show that a hybrid tuning strategy yields the best performance: full
fine-tuning of the UNet is better at capturing low-level SAR-specific patterns,
while LoRA-based partial tuning of the text encoder, combined with embedding
learning of the <SAR> token, suffices to preserve prompt alignment. This work
provides a methodical strategy for adapting foundation models to unconventional
imaging modalities beyond natural image domains.

Conclusion: $TA^{2}Net$在无需音频输入的情况下，成功实现了可听动作的时间定位和声源空间定位，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Audible Action Temporal Localization, which aims to
identify the spatio-temporal coordinates of audible movements. Unlike
conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization,
which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic
dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are
driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound
often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose
$TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the
second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on
audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization
strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis.
This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously
identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we
introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and
UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments
confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong
generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source
localization. Code and dataset are available at

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用多模态信息，提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Owing to its rapid progress and broad application prospects, few-shot action
recognition has attracted considerable interest. However, current methods are
predominantly based on limited single-modal data, which does not fully exploit
the potential of multimodal information. This paper presents a novel framework
that actively identifies reliable modalities for each sample using
task-specific contextual cues, thus significantly improving recognition
performance. Our framework integrates an Active Sample Inference (ASI) module,
which utilizes active inference to predict reliable modalities based on
posterior distributions and subsequently organizes them accordingly. Unlike
reinforcement learning, active inference replaces rewards with evidence-based
preferences, making more stable predictions. Additionally, we introduce an
active mutual distillation module that enhances the representation learning of
less reliable modalities by transferring knowledge from more reliable ones.
Adaptive multimodal inference is employed during the meta-test to assign higher
weights to reliable modalities. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches.

Abstract: Data visualization generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown
promising results but often produces suboptimal visualizations that require
human intervention for improvement. In this work, we introduce VIS-Shepherd, a
specialized Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based critic to evaluate and

corresponding LLM-generated instances, and construct high-quality critiques. We
conduct both model-based automatic evaluation and human preference studies to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments show that even

gains by leveraging our high-quality visualization critique dataset, reaching

increasing attention in agriculture, offering unique capabilities for
monitoring vegetation dynamics thanks to its all-weather, day-and-night
operation and high revisit frequency. This study presents, for the first time,
a comprehensive analysis combining dual-polarimetric radar vegetation index
(DpRVI) with optical indices to characterize vineyard crops. Vineyards exhibit
distinct non-isotropic scattering behavior due to their pronounced row
orientation, making them particularly challenging and interesting targets for
remote sensing. The research further investigates the relationship between
DpRVI and optical vegetation indices, demonstrating the complementary nature of
their information. We demonstrate that DpRVI and optical indices provide
complementary information, with low correlation suggesting that they capture
distinct vineyard features. Key findings reveal a parabolic trend in DpRVI over
the growing season, potentially linked to biomass dynamics estimated via the
Winkler Index. Unlike optical indices reflecting vegetation greenness, DpRVI
appears more directly related to biomass growth, aligning with specific
phenological phases. Preliminary results also highlight the potential of DpRVI
for distinguishing vineyards from other crops. This research aligns with the
objectives of the PNRR-NODES project, which promotes nature-based solutions
(NbS) for sustainable vineyard management. The application of DpRVI for
monitoring vineyards is part of integrating remote sensing techniques into the
broader field of strategies for climate-related change adaptation and risk
reduction, emphasizing the role of innovative SAR-based monitoring in
sustainable agriculture.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了自监督学习（SSL）方法Masked Autoencoders（MAEs）在葡萄品种识别中的应用，通过无标签数据训练，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统葡萄品种识别方法（如形态学和分子分析）存在主观性高、成本高和耗时长的问题，而依赖迁移学习的深度学习方法因数据集小和领域偏移导致性能下降。

Method: 使用MAEs对43种葡萄品种的田间图像进行自监督预训练，并比较不同模型和训练策略的性能。

Result: MAE预训练的ViT-B/16模型F1分数达0.7956，优于其他模型，且对预训练时长、数据增强方法和掩码比率的影响进行了分析。

Conclusion: MAEs在农业图像分类中表现优异，尤其在低数据量下仍能保持高性能，为葡萄品种识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Grapevine varieties are essential for the economies of many wine-producing
countries, influencing the production of wine, juice, and the consumption of
fruits and leaves. Traditional identification methods, such as ampelography and
molecular analysis, have limitations: ampelography depends on expert knowledge
and is inherently subjective, while molecular methods are costly and
time-intensive. To address these limitations, recent studies have applied deep
learning (DL) models to classify grapevine varieties using image data. However,
due to the small dataset sizes, these methods often depend on transfer learning
from datasets from other domains, e.g., ImageNet1K (IN1K), which can lead to
performance degradation due to domain shift and supervision collapse. In this
context, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods can be a good tool to avoid
this performance degradation, since they can learn directly from data, without
external labels. This study presents an evaluation of Masked Autoencoders
(MAEs) for identifying grapevine varieties based on field-acquired images. The
main contributions of this study include two benchmarks comprising 43 grapevine
varieties collected across different seasons, an analysis of MAE's application
in the agricultural context, and a performance comparison of trained models
across seasons. Our results show that a ViT-B/16 model pre-trained with MAE and
the unlabeled dataset achieved an F1 score of 0.7956, outperforming all other
models. Additionally, we observed that pre-trained models benefit from long
pre-training, perform well under low-data training regime, and that simple data
augmentation methods are more effective than complex ones. The study also found
that the mask ratio in MAE impacts performance only marginally.

Conclusion: 为高质量图像预训练模型适应视频修复提供了有效范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video face restoration faces a critical challenge in maintaining temporal
consistency while recovering fine facial details from degraded inputs. This
paper presents a novel approach that extends Vector-Quantized Variational
Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), pretrained on static high-quality portraits, into a
video restoration framework through variational latent space modeling. Our key
innovation lies in reformulating discrete codebook representations as
Dirichlet-distributed continuous variables, enabling probabilistic transitions
between facial features across frames. A spatio-temporal Transformer
architecture jointly models inter-frame dependencies and predicts latent
distributions, while a Laplacian-constrained reconstruction loss combined with
perceptual (LPIPS) regularization enhances both pixel accuracy and visual
quality. Comprehensive evaluations on blind face restoration, video inpainting,
and facial colorization tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This
work establishes an effective paradigm for adapting intensive image priors,
pretrained on high-quality images, to video restoration while addressing the
critical challenge of flicker artifacts. The source code has been open-sourced

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架TR2M，将相对深度转换为度量深度，解决了现有方法在跨域泛化和尺度不确定性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法分为度量深度估计（MMDE）和相对深度估计（MRDE），前者受限于特定领域，后者泛化能力强但尺度不确定。TR2M旨在解决尺度不确定性并实现相对深度到度量深度的转换。

Result: TR2M在多个数据集上表现优异，并展示了在未见数据集上的零样本能力。

Conclusion: TR2M展示了语言辅助下像素级转换相对深度到度量深度的巨大潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a generalizable framework to transfer relative depth to
metric depth. Current monocular depth estimation methods are mainly divided
into metric depth estimation (MMDE) and relative depth estimation (MRDE). MMDEs
estimate depth in metric scale but are often limited to a specific domain.
MRDEs generalize well across different domains, but with uncertain scales which
hinders downstream applications. To this end, we aim to build up a framework to
solve scale uncertainty and transfer relative depth to metric depth. Previous
methods used language as input and estimated two factors for conducting
rescaling. Our approach, TR2M, utilizes both text description and image as
inputs and estimates two rescale maps to transfer relative depth to metric
depth at pixel level. Features from two modalities are fused with a
cross-modality attention module to better capture scale information. A strategy
is designed to construct and filter confident pseudo metric depth for more
comprehensive supervision. We also develop scale-oriented contrastive learning
to utilize depth distribution as guidance to enforce the model learning about
intrinsic knowledge aligning with the scale distribution. TR2M only exploits a
small number of trainable parameters to train on datasets in various domains
and experiments not only demonstrate TR2M's great performance in seen datasets
but also reveal superior zero-shot capabilities on five unseen datasets. We
show the huge potential in pixel-wise transferring relative depth to metric
depth with language assistance. (Code is available at:

Result: 在多种逆问题中表现优异，尤其在压缩感知中，即使在极低采样率（5%）下也能实现高质量重建。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本成像逆问题提供了高效灵活的解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in imaging inverse problems
owing to their powerful generative capabilities. However, existing approaches
typically rely on models trained for specific degradation types, limiting their
generalizability to various degradation scenarios. To address this limitation,
we propose a zero-shot framework capable of handling various imaging inverse
problems without model retraining. We introduce a likelihood-guided noise
refinement mechanism that derives a closed-form approximation of the likelihood
score, simplifying score estimation and avoiding expensive gradient
computations. This estimated score is subsequently utilized to refine the
model-predicted noise, thereby better aligning the restoration process with the
generative framework of diffusion models. In addition, we integrate the
Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) sampling strategy to further improve
inference efficiency. The proposed mechanism can be applied to both
optimization-based and sampling-based schemes, providing an effective and
flexible zero-shot solution for imaging inverse problems. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
inverse problems, particularly in compressive sensing, delivering high-quality
reconstructions even at an extremely low sampling rate (5%).

Conclusion: 展示了从图像中提取医学相关信号的潜力，并公开代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of
accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method
that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate
remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust
uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies
systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can
be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on
an established Dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two
new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly,
our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a
bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for
clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting
medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available
to facilitate further research.

Result: 在Prophesee数据集上验证，SEED在计算效率和性能上优于现有方法，显著减少突触操作并保持或提升mAP。

Conclusion: SEED的硬件感知设计在神经形态处理器上实现了高效能和低延迟，为事件相机应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging the high temporal resolution and dynamic range, object detection
with event cameras can enhance the performance and safety of automotive and
robotics applications in real-world scenarios. However, processing sparse event
data requires compute-intensive convolutional recurrent units, complicating
their integration into resource-constrained edge applications. Here, we propose
the Sparse Event-based Efficient Detector (SEED) for efficient event-based
object detection on neuromorphic processors. We introduce sparse convolutional
recurrent learning, which achieves over 92% activation sparsity in recurrent
processing, vastly reducing the cost for spatiotemporal reasoning on sparse
event data. We validated our method on Prophesee's 1 Mpx and Gen1 event-based
object detection datasets. Notably, SEED sets a new benchmark in computational
efficiency for event-based object detection which requires long-term temporal
learning. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, SEED significantly reduces
synaptic operations while delivering higher or same-level mAP. Our hardware
simulations showcase the critical role of SEED's hardware-aware design in
achieving energy-efficient and low-latency neuromorphic processing.

Result: 在NYU和ScanNet数据集上表现优异，SelfToF*在不同稀疏性ToF数据中保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: SelfToF方法高效且有效，代码将公开。

Abstract: Depth map enhancement using paired high-resolution RGB images offers a
cost-effective solution for improving low-resolution depth data from
lightweight ToF sensors. Nevertheless, naively adopting a depth estimation
pipeline to fuse the two modalities requires groundtruth depth maps for
supervision. To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework,
SelfToF, which generates detailed and scale-aware depth maps. Starting from an
image-based self-supervised depth estimation pipeline, we add low-resolution
depth as inputs, design a new depth consistency loss, propose a scale-recovery
module, and finally obtain a large performance boost. Furthermore, since the
ToF signal sparsity varies in real-world applications, we upgrade SelfToF to
SelfToF* with submanifold convolution and guided feature fusion. Consequently,
SelfToF* maintain robust performance across varying sparsity levels in ToF
data. Overall, our proposed method is both efficient and effective, as verified
by extensive experiments on the NYU and ScanNet datasets. The code will be made
public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无约束的真实场景中，遮挡会降低人脸年龄估计的准确性，现有方法对此表现不佳。

Method: 使用SN-Patch GAN去除遮挡，结合ARCM和Swin Transformer增强特征表示，并引入MTAH结合回归和分布学习。

Result: 在FG-NET、UTKFace和MORPH数据集上，MAE分别为3.00、4.54和2.53年，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在遮挡条件下的人脸年龄估计中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Facial age estimation has achieved considerable success under controlled
conditions. However, in unconstrained real-world scenarios, which are often
referred to as 'in the wild', age estimation remains challenging, especially
when faces are partially occluded, which may obscure their visibility. To
address this limitation, we propose a new approach integrating generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer architectures to enable robust age
estimation from occluded faces. We employ an SN-Patch GAN to effectively remove
occlusions, while an Attentive Residual Convolution Module (ARCM), paired with
a Swin Transformer, enhances feature representation. Additionally, we introduce
a Multi-Task Age Head (MTAH) that combines regression and distribution
learning, further improving age estimation under occlusion. Experimental
results on the FG-NET, UTKFace, and MORPH datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art techniques for occluded
facial age estimation by achieving an MAE of $3.00$, $4.54$, and $2.53$ years,
respectively.

Conclusion: 不同方法适用于不同场景，启发式方法在简单场景中领先，而深度学习方法在复杂场景中更具优势。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a core task in computer vision that involves
detecting objects in video frames and associating them across time. The rise of
deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the
tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach.
Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the
introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end
tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT
methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five
groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity
learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking
methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the
performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically
assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our
findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results
on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep
learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and
end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.

Result: 实验表明SA-LUT在LPIPS评分上比3D LUT方法降低66.7%，同时保持实时性能（16 FPS）。

Conclusion: SA-LUT在真实感风格迁移中表现出色，并提供了首个专门评估PST的基准PST50。

Abstract: Photorealistic style transfer (PST) enables real-world color grading by
adapting reference image colors while preserving content structure. Existing
methods mainly follow either approaches: generation-based methods that
prioritize stylistic fidelity at the cost of content integrity and efficiency,
or global color transformation methods such as LUT, which preserve structure
but lack local adaptability. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatial Adaptive 4D
Look-Up Table (SA-LUT), combining LUT efficiency with neural network
adaptability. SA-LUT features: (1) a Style-guided 4D LUT Generator that
extracts multi-scale features from the style image to predict a 4D LUT, and (2)
a Context Generator using content-style cross-attention to produce a context
map. This context map enables spatially-adaptive adjustments, allowing our 4D
LUT to apply precise color transformations while preserving structural
integrity. To establish a rigorous evaluation framework for photorealistic
style transfer, we introduce PST50, the first benchmark specifically designed
for PST assessment. Experiments demonstrate that SA-LUT substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 66.7% reduction in LPIPS
score compared to 3D LUT approaches, while maintaining real-time performance at

Conclusion: ESRPCB框架有效解决了小尺度PCB图像缺陷检测的挑战，提升了检测准确性。

Abstract: Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are critical components in modern electronics,
which require stringent quality control to ensure proper functionality.
However, the detection of defects in small-scale PCBs images poses significant
challenges as a result of the low resolution of the captured images, leading to
potential confusion between defects and noise. To overcome these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel framework, named ESRPCB (edgeguided
super-resolution for PCBs defect detection), which combines edgeguided
super-resolution with ensemble learning to enhance PCBs defect detection. The
framework leverages the edge information to guide the EDSR (Enhanced Deep
Super-Resolution) model with a novel ResCat (Residual Concatenation) structure,
enabling it to reconstruct high-resolution images from small PCBs inputs. By
incorporating edge features, the super-resolution process preserves critical
structural details, ensuring that tiny defects remain distinguishable in the
enhanced image. Following this, a multi-modal defect detection model employs
ensemble learning to analyze the super-resolved

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating realistic abundance
maps from hyperspectral imagery using an unsupervised, deep-learning-driven
approach. Our framework integrates blind linear hyperspectral unmixing with
state-of-the-art diffusion models to enhance the realism and diversity of
synthetic abundance maps. First, we apply blind unmixing to extract endmembers
and abundance maps directly from raw hyperspectral data. These abundance maps
then serve as inputs to a diffusion model, which acts as a generative engine to
synthesize highly realistic spatial distributions. Diffusion models have
recently revolutionized image synthesis by offering superior performance,
flexibility, and stability, making them well-suited for high-dimensional
spectral data. By leveraging this combination of physically interpretable
unmixing and deep generative modeling, our approach enables the simulation of
hyperspectral sensor outputs under diverse imaging conditions--critical for
data augmentation, algorithm benchmarking, and model evaluation in
hyperspectral analysis. Notably, our method is entirely unsupervised, ensuring
adaptability to different datasets without the need for labeled training data.
We validate our approach using real hyperspectral imagery from the PRISMA space
mission for Earth observation, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing
realistic synthetic abundance maps that capture the spatial and spectral
characteristics of natural scenes.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis has been a crucial task in computer
graphics, with applications ranging from educational tools to AI-driven
mathematical reasoning. Traditionally, we rely on computer tools (e.g.,
Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to manually generate precise diagrams, but it usually
requires huge, complicated calculations cost. Recently, researchers start to
work on learning-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT4) to
automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering
from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework GeoSDF to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and
accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent
geometric elements in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions
to represent geometric relationships, next we optimize such constraint
functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints, finally
by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our
GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to easily represent geometric elements
and those constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be
self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual
plausibility. In experiments, our GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school
level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. Through both qualitative and
quantitative analysis, we can see that synthesized diagrams are realistic and
accurate, and our synthesizing process is simple and efficient. Furthermore, we
obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\% while the
current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification
property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for
more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for
a wide array of applications.

Abstract: Patent images are technical drawings that convey information about a patent's
innovation. Patent image retrieval systems aim to search in vast collections
and retrieve the most relevant images. Despite recent advances in information
retrieval, patent images still pose significant challenges due to their
technical intricacies and complex semantic information, requiring efficient
fine-tuning for domain adaptation. Current methods neglect patents'
hierarchical relationships, such as those defined by the Locarno International
Classification (LIC) system, which groups broad categories (e.g., "furnishing")
into subclasses (e.g., "seats" and "beds") and further into specific patent
designs. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-positive contrastive
loss that leverages the LIC's taxonomy to induce such relations in the
retrieval process. Our approach assigns multiple positive pairs to each patent
image within a batch, with varying similarity scores based on the hierarchical
taxonomy. Our experimental analysis with various vision and multimodal models
on the DeepPatent2 dataset shows that the proposed method enhances the
retrieval results. Notably, our method is effective with low-parameter models,
which require fewer computational resources and can be deployed on environments
with limited hardware.

Conclusion: FOAM通过频域优化和分层去干扰机制，有效提升了重叠物体感知能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Overlapping object perception aims to decouple the randomly overlapping
foreground-background features, extracting foreground features while
suppressing background features, which holds significant application value in
fields such as security screening and medical auxiliary diagnosis. Despite some
research efforts to tackle the challenge of overlapping object perception, most
solutions are confined to the spatial domain. Through frequency domain
analysis, we observe that the degradation of contours and textures due to the
overlapping phenomenon can be intuitively reflected in the magnitude spectrum.
Based on this observation, we propose a general Frequency-Optimized
Anti-Overlapping Framework (FOAM) to assist the model in extracting more
texture and contour information, thereby enhancing the ability for
anti-overlapping object perception. Specifically, we design the Frequency
Spatial Transformer Block (FSTB), which can simultaneously extract features
from both the frequency and spatial domains, helping the network capture more
texture features from the foreground. In addition, we introduce the
Hierarchical De-Corrupting (HDC) mechanism, which aligns adjacent features in
the separately constructed base branch and corruption branch using a specially
designed consistent loss during the training phase. This mechanism suppresses
the response to irrelevant background features of FSTBs, thereby improving the
perception of foreground contour. We conduct extensive experiments to validate
the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FOAM, which further
improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on four datasets, specifically
for the three overlapping object perception tasks: Prohibited Item Detection,
Prohibited Item Segmentation, and Pneumonia Detection. The code will be open
source once the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 探索人眼微动下视觉稳定的心理物理学机制，揭示其复杂性。

Method: 通过十多年的实验研究，分析视觉稳定的心理物理学特性。

Result: 实验揭示了视觉稳定行为的特定视网膜信号处理机制。

Conclusion: 提出了功能描述和神经电路层面的假设，解释视觉稳定机制。

Abstract: Even during fixation the human eye is constantly in low amplitude motion,
jittering over small angles in random directions at up to 100Hz. This motion
results in all features of the image on the retina constantly traversing a
number of cones, yet objects which are stable in the world are perceived to be
stable, and any object which is moving in the world is perceived to be moving.
A series of experiments carried out over a dozen years revealed the
psychophysics of visual stabilization to be more nuanced than might be assumed,
say, from the mechanics of stabilization of camera images, or what might be
assumed to be the simplest solution from an evolutionary perspective. The
psychophysics revealed by the experiments strongly implies a specific set of
operations on retinal signals resulting in the observed stabilization behavior.
The presentation is in two levels. First is a functional description of the
action of the mechanism that is very likely responsible for the experimentally
observed behavior. Second is a more speculative proposal of circuit-level
neural elements that might implement the functional behavior.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了MVS和高斯泼溅的优势，解决了几何不准确问题。

Abstract: Recent methods, such as 2D Gaussian Splatting and Gaussian Opacity Fields,
have aimed to address the geometric inaccuracies of 3D Gaussian Splatting while
retaining its superior rendering quality. However, these approaches still
struggle to reconstruct smooth and reliable geometry, particularly in scenes
with significant color variation across viewpoints, due to their per-point
appearance modeling and single-view optimization constraints. In this paper, we
propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that
integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into
Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the
complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian
Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of
high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar
constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy
depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation.
To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative
depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth
information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided
Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal
positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully
combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering
quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了所提方法的有效性和可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗图像检索提供了一种无需人工标注的评估方案，考虑了概念间的关联性。

Abstract: Performance evaluation for Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) remains a
crucial but unsolved problem today especially in the medical domain. Various
evaluation metrics have been discussed in the literature to solve this problem.
Most of the existing metrics (e.g., precision, recall) are adapted from
classification tasks which require manual labels as ground truth. However, such
labels are often expensive and unavailable in specific thematic domains.
Furthermore, medical images are usually associated with (radiological) case
reports or annotated with descriptive captions in literature figures, such text
contains information that can help to assess CBIR.Several researchers have
argued that the medical concepts hidden in the text can serve as the basis for
CBIR evaluation purpose. However, these works often consider these medical
concepts as independent and isolated labels while in fact the subtle
relationships between various concepts are neglected. In this work, we
introduce the use of knowledge graphs to measure the distance between various
medical concepts and propose a novel relevance measure for the evaluation of
CBIR by defining an approximate matching-based relevance score between two sets
of medical concepts which allows us to indirectly measure the similarity
between medical images.We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and
feasibility of our relevance measure using a public dataset.

Conclusion: SMW-GS为复杂场景的3D重建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from unconstrained image collections poses
significant challenges due to variations in appearance. In this paper, we
propose Scalable Micro-macro Wavelet-based Gaussian Splatting (SMW-GS), a novel
method that enhances 3D reconstruction across diverse scales by decomposing
scene representations into global, refined, and intrinsic components. SMW-GS
incorporates the following innovations: Micro-macro Projection, which enables
Gaussian points to sample multi-scale details with improved diversity; and
Wavelet-based Sampling, which refines feature representations using
frequency-domain information to better capture complex scene appearances. To
achieve scalability, we further propose a large-scale scene promotion strategy,
which optimally assigns camera views to scene partitions by maximizing their
contributions to Gaussian points, achieving consistent and high-quality
reconstructions even in expansive environments. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SMW-GS significantly outperforms existing methods in both
reconstruction quality and scalability, particularly excelling in large-scale
urban environments with challenging illumination variations. Project is

Motivation: 现有模型依赖固定输入格式和特定模态编码器，难以适应多样化的遥感数据配置，限制了跨模态的泛化能力。

Method: Atomizer将图像表示为标量集合，每个标量对应像素的谱带值，并添加元数据。采用结构化标记化和交叉注意力映射到潜在空间。

Result: 在模态分离评估中，Atomizer优于标准模型，并在不同分辨率和空间尺寸下表现稳健。

Conclusion: Atomizer提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，能够处理多样化的遥感数据配置，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The growing number of Earth observation satellites has led to increasingly
diverse remote sensing data, with varying spatial, spectral, and temporal
configurations. Most existing models rely on fixed input formats and
modality-specific encoders, which require retraining when new configurations
are introduced, limiting their ability to generalize across modalities. We
introduce Atomizer, a flexible architecture that represents remote sensing
images as sets of scalars, each corresponding to a spectral band value of a
pixel. Each scalar is enriched with contextual metadata (acquisition time,
spatial resolution, wavelength, and bandwidth), producing an atomic
representation that allows a single encoder to process arbitrary modalities
without interpolation or resampling. Atomizer uses structured tokenization with
Fourier features and non-uniform radial basis functions to encode content and
context, and maps tokens into a latent space via cross-attention. Under
modality-disjoint evaluations, Atomizer outperforms standard models and
demonstrates robust performance across varying resolutions and spatial sizes.

Motivation: CBCT在放疗中广泛应用，但慢速旋转会导致运动伪影和剂量增加，限制了其性能。

Method: 结合两个去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs），通过投影和图像空间互补先验，完成缺失投影并优化体积重建。

Result: 在78个CT数据集上测试，平均绝对误差35.5 HU，SSIM 0.84，PSNR 29.8 dB，伪影减少，软组织清晰度提升。

Conclusion: LA-GICD为有限角度CBCT重建提供了实用解决方案，显著提升放疗中的图像质量和效率。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in clinical radiotherapy for image-guided
treatment, improving setup accuracy, adaptive planning, and motion management.
However, slow gantry rotation limits performance by introducing motion
artifacts, blurring, and increased dose. This work aims to develop a clinically
feasible method for reconstructing high-quality CBCT volumes from consecutive
limited-angle acquisitions, addressing imaging challenges in time- or
dose-constrained settings. We propose a limited-angle (LA) geometry-integrated
cycle-domain (LA-GICD) framework for CBCT reconstruction, comprising two
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) connected via analytic
cone-beam forward and back projectors. A Projection-DDPM completes missing
projections, followed by back-projection, and an Image-DDPM refines the volume.
This dual-domain design leverages complementary priors from projection and
image spaces to achieve high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle (<= 90
degrees) scans. Performance was evaluated against full-angle reconstruction.
Four board-certified medical physicists conducted assessments. A total of 78
planning CTs in common CBCT geometries were used for training and evaluation.
The method achieved a mean absolute error of 35.5 HU, SSIM of 0.84, and PSNR of
29.8 dB, with visibly reduced artifacts and improved soft-tissue clarity.
LA-GICD's geometry-aware dual-domain learning, embedded in analytic
forward/backward operators, enabled artifact-free, high-contrast
reconstructions from a single 90-degree scan, reducing acquisition time and
dose four-fold. LA-GICD improves limited-angle CBCT reconstruction with strong
data fidelity and anatomical realism. It offers a practical solution for
short-arc acquisitions, enhancing CBCT use in radiotherapy by providing
clinically applicable images with reduced scan time and dose for more accurate,
personalized treatments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合关系建模的车道检测与拓扑推理方法，显著提升了自动驾驶中的道路元素感知与拓扑推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独处理车道检测或拓扑推理，忽略了车道与交通元素（L2T）的关系，且未联合优化这些任务。关系建模对感知和推理均有帮助，人类也依赖上下文关系进行道路元素识别。

Method: 1) 提出关系感知的车道检测器，通过几何偏置自注意力和曲线交叉注意力捕获关系依赖；2) 设计关系增强的拓扑头，包括几何增强的L2L头和跨视图L2T头；3) 使用对比学习策略正则化关系嵌入。

Conclusion: 关系建模能显著提升车道检测和拓扑推理性能，为自动驾驶提供更准确的道路结构理解。

Abstract: Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling
effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task
are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically
focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often
\textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or
\textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches
either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the
inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational
modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally
leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their
connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both
perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding.
Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our
geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane
representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced
topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T
head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning
strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive
experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3
in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new
state-of-the-art. Code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models are advancing autonomous driving by enabling realistic data
synthesis, predictive end-to-end planning, and closed-loop simulation, with a
primary focus on temporally consistent generation. However, the generation of
large-scale 3D scenes that require spatial coherence remains underexplored. In
this paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene
generation that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity,
while offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports
multi-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or
text-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic
guidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient
customization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a
unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the
corresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities.
Additionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene
through consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy
and images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial
continuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted
into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as
scene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene
significantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving
scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous
driving.

Abstract: We propose an efficient framework to compress multiple video-frame features
before feeding them into large multimodal models, thereby mitigating the severe
token explosion arising from long or dense videos. Our design leverages a
bidirectional state-space-based block equipped with a gated skip connection and
a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted
learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both
spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective
manner. Across challenging long and dense video understanding tasks, our
approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models,
while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our
proposed state-space block with a conventional Transformer results in
substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of state-space
modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video data. Our framework
emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world
deployments. We validate its scalability and generality across multiple
benchmarks, achieving the dual objectives of efficient resource usage and
comprehensive video understanding.

an integrated workflow, which integrates high-fidelity 3D reconstruction based
on monocular video, finite element simulation analysis, and mixed reality
visual display, aiming to build an interactive digital twin system for
industrial inspection, equipment maintenance and other scenes. Firstly, the
Neuralangelo algorithm based on deep learning is used to reconstruct the 3D
mesh model with rich details from the surround-shot video. Then, the QuadRemesh
tool of Rhino is used to optimize the initial triangular mesh and generate a
structured mesh suitable for finite element analysis. The optimized mesh is
further discretized by HyperMesh, and the material parameter setting and stress
simulation are carried out in Abaqus to obtain high-precision stress and
deformation results. Finally, combined with Unity and Vuforia engine, the
real-time superposition and interactive operation of simulation results in the
augmented reality environment are realized, which improves users 'intuitive
understanding of structural response. Experiments show that the method has good
simulation efficiency and visualization effect while maintaining high geometric
accuracy. It provides a practical solution for digital modeling, mechanical
analysis and interactive display in complex industrial scenes, and lays a
foundation for the deep integration of digital twin and mixed reality
technology in industrial applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to
fixed context windows and weak long-term dependency modeling. Existing
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for videos use static retrieval
strategies, leading to inefficiencies for simple queries and information loss
for complex tasks. To address this, we propose AdaVideoRAG, a novel framework
that dynamically adapts retrieval granularity based on query complexity using a
lightweight intent classifier. Our framework employs an Omni-Knowledge Indexing
module to build hierarchical databases from text (captions, ASR, OCR), visual
features, and semantic graphs, enabling optimal resource allocation across
tasks. We also introduce the HiVU benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy for long-video
understanding, with seamless integration into existing MLLMs. AdaVideoRAG
establishes a new paradigm for adaptive retrieval in video analysis. Codes will

Abstract: Distilling pre-trained 2D diffusion models into 3D assets has driven
remarkable advances in text-to-3D synthesis. However, existing methods
typically rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which involves
asymmetric KL divergence--a formulation that inherently favors mode-seeking
behavior and limits generation diversity. In this paper, we introduce Dive3D, a
novel text-to-3D generation framework that replaces KL-based objectives with
Score Implicit Matching (SIM) loss, a score-based objective that effectively
mitigates mode collapse. Furthermore, Dive3D integrates both diffusion
distillation and reward-guided optimization under a unified divergence
perspective. Such reformulation, together with SIM loss, yields significantly
more diverse 3D outputs while improving text alignment, human preference, and
overall visual fidelity. We validate Dive3D across various 2D-to-3D prompts and
find that it consistently outperforms prior methods in qualitative assessments,
including diversity, photorealism, and aesthetic appeal. We further evaluate
its performance on the GPTEval3D benchmark, comparing against nine
state-of-the-art baselines. Dive3D also achieves strong results on quantitative
metrics, including text-asset alignment, 3D plausibility, text-geometry
consistency, texture quality, and geometric detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeQ-Graph 是一种通过无预定义词汇的3D场景图实现自由形式语义查询的方法，结合了LLM和LVLM指导，提升了3D场景理解的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景理解方法依赖预定义词汇或LLM，限制了自由形式语义查询，且LLM生成的输出可能存在不一致性。

Method: 1. 构建无预定义词汇的3D场景图；2. 通过超点合并对齐语义标签；3. 设计基于LLM的推理算法结合场景和对象信息。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验表明，FreeQ-Graph在复杂自由形式语义查询和关系推理中表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeQ-Graph通过语义一致的场景图实现了高效的3D场景理解，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Semantic querying in complex 3D scenes through free-form language presents a
significant challenge. Existing 3D scene understanding methods use large-scale
training data and CLIP to align text queries with 3D semantic features.
However, their reliance on predefined vocabulary priors from training data
hinders free-form semantic querying. Besides, recent advanced methods rely on
LLMs for scene understanding but lack comprehensive 3D scene-level information
and often overlook the potential inconsistencies in LLM-generated outputs. In
our paper, we propose FreeQ-Graph, which enables Free-form Querying with a
semantic consistent scene Graph for 3D scene understanding. The core idea is to
encode free-form queries from a complete and accurate 3D scene graph without
predefined vocabularies, and to align them with 3D consistent semantic labels,
which accomplished through three key steps. We initiate by constructing a
complete and accurate 3D scene graph that maps free-form objects and their
relations through LLM and LVLM guidance, entirely free from training data or
predefined priors. Most importantly, we align graph nodes with accurate
semantic labels by leveraging 3D semantic aligned features from merged
superpoints, enhancing 3D semantic consistency. To enable free-form semantic
querying, we then design an LLM-based reasoning algorithm that combines
scene-level and object-level information to intricate reasoning. We conducted
extensive experiments on 3D semantic grounding, segmentation, and complex
querying tasks, while also validating the accuracy of graph generation.
Experiments on 6 datasets show that our model excels in both complex free-form
semantic queries and intricate relational reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DualEdit，一种针对视觉语言模型（VLM）的双模态编辑方法，通过分析文本和视觉模态对编辑性能的影响，优化了编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编辑方法主要针对单模态语言模型，而视觉语言模型的多模态特性及其对编辑性能的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 探索文本和视觉模态对编辑的影响，发现它们在关键层的敏感性差异，并提出DualEdit方法，结合双模态编辑和门控模块。

Result: DualEdit在多个VLM骨干和基准数据集上表现优异，优于现有VLM和LLM编辑方法。

Conclusion: DualEdit通过双模态编辑和门控模块，高效更新知识并保留原始能力，为VLM编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge
without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering
editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing
single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models
(VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality
on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find
that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at
different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both
modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of
compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we
propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at
their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within
the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update
new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate
DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating
its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted
LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ego-R1是一个用于超长（数天至数周）自我中心视频推理的新框架，采用结构化工具链思维（CoTT）和强化学习（RL）训练的代理，显著提升时间覆盖范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超长自我中心视频的理解难题，传统方法时间覆盖有限。

Method: 通过CoTT分解复杂推理为模块化步骤，RL代理动态调用工具，两阶段训练（SFT和RL）优化代理性能。

Result: 在Ego-R1 Bench测试中，Ego-R1代理显著扩展时间覆盖范围至一周。

Conclusion: 动态工具增强的链式思维推理有效应对超长视频理解挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Ego-R1, a novel framework for reasoning over ultra-long (i.e.,
in days and weeks) egocentric videos, which leverages a structured
Chain-of-Tool-Thought (CoTT) process, orchestrated by an Ego-R1 Agent trained
via reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by human problem-solving strategies,
CoTT decomposes complex reasoning into modular steps, with the RL agent
invoking specific tools, one per step, to iteratively and collaboratively
answer sub-questions tackling such tasks as temporal retrieval and multi-modal
understanding. We design a two-stage training paradigm involving supervised
finetuning (SFT) of a pretrained language model using CoTT data and RL to
enable our agent to dynamically propose step-by-step tools for long-range
reasoning. To facilitate training, we construct a dataset called Ego-R1 Data,
which consists of Ego-CoTT-25K for SFT and Ego-QA-4.4K for RL. Furthermore, our
Ego-R1 agent is evaluated on a newly curated week-long video QA benchmark,
Ego-R1 Bench, which contains human-verified QA pairs from hybrid sources.
Extensive results demonstrate that the dynamic, tool-augmented chain-of-thought
reasoning by our Ego-R1 Agent can effectively tackle the unique challenges of
understanding ultra-long egocentric videos, significantly extending the time
coverage from few hours to a week.

Motivation: 为教育视频中的视觉内容检测提供高质量的数据集，支持监督和半监督方法的研究。

Method: 数据集包含手动标注的1000帧（LVVO_1k）和半监督标注的3000帧（LVVO_3k），标注过程包括双标注和专家冲突解决。

Result: 标注一致性高（F1分数83.41%），数据集公开可用。

Conclusion: LVVO数据集为教育视频视觉检测研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: We introduce the Lecture Video Visual Objects (LVVO) dataset, a new benchmark
for visual object detection in educational video content. The dataset consists
of 4,000 frames extracted from 245 lecture videos spanning biology, computer
science, and geosciences. A subset of 1,000 frames, referred to as LVVO_1k, has
been manually annotated with bounding boxes for four visual categories: Table,
Chart-Graph, Photographic-image, and Visual-illustration. Each frame was
labeled independently by two annotators, resulting in an inter-annotator F1
score of 83.41%, indicating strong agreement. To ensure high-quality consensus
annotations, a third expert reviewed and resolved all cases of disagreement
through a conflict resolution process. To expand the dataset, a semi-supervised
approach was employed to automatically annotate the remaining 3,000 frames,
forming LVVO_3k. The complete dataset offers a valuable resource for developing
and evaluating both supervised and semi-supervised methods for visual content
detection in educational videos. The LVVO dataset is publicly available to
support further research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集无法满足高质量视频生成模型的需求，如电影级UHD视频和4K短视频内容的生成。

Method: 设计了四阶段高度自动化的数据筛选流程：多样高质量视频片段收集、统计过滤、基于模型的数据净化、生成结构化字幕。

Result: 提出了UltraVideo数据集和UltraWan模型，支持高质量1K/4K视频生成，并展示了数据筛选的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作对未来UHD视频生成研究具有重要贡献，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: The quality of the video dataset (image quality, resolution, and fine-grained
caption) greatly influences the performance of the video generation model. The
growing demand for video applications sets higher requirements for high-quality
video generation models. For example, the generation of movie-level Ultra-High
Definition (UHD) videos and the creation of 4K short video content. However,
the existing public datasets cannot support related research and applications.
In this paper, we first propose a high-quality open-sourced UHD-4K (22.4\% of
which are 8K) text-to-video dataset named UltraVideo, which contains a wide
range of topics (more than 100 kinds), and each video has 9 structured captions
with one summarized caption (average of 824 words). Specifically, we carefully
design a highly automated curation process with four stages to obtain the final
high-quality dataset: \textit{i)} collection of diverse and high-quality video
clips. \textit{ii)} statistical data filtering. \textit{iii)} model-based data
purification. \textit{iv)} generation of comprehensive, structured captions. In
addition, we expand Wan to UltraWan-1K/-4K, which can natively generate
high-quality 1K/4K videos with more consistent text controllability,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our data curation.We believe that this work
can make a significant contribution to future research on UHD video generation.

TL;DR: Vid-CamEdit是一种新颖的视频相机轨迹编辑框架，能够根据用户定义的路径重新合成单目视频。该方法通过几何先验和生成渲染的结合，解决了极端轨迹变化和野外视频处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重建方法难以处理极端轨迹变化，而现有的动态新视角合成生成模型无法处理野外视频。Vid-CamEdit旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 方法分为两步：估计时间一致的几何结构，以及基于该几何结构的生成渲染。通过分解微调框架，分别训练空间和时间组件，减少了对大量4D训练数据的需求。

Result: 该方法在从新相机轨迹生成逼真视频方面优于基线，尤其是在真实场景的极端外推情况下。

Conclusion: Vid-CamEdit通过几何先验和生成模型的结合，成功解决了视频相机轨迹编辑的挑战，适用于野外视频处理。

Abstract: We introduce Vid-CamEdit, a novel framework for video camera trajectory
editing, enabling the re-synthesis of monocular videos along user-defined
camera paths. This task is challenging due to its ill-posed nature and the
limited multi-view video data for training. Traditional reconstruction methods
struggle with extreme trajectory changes, and existing generative models for
dynamic novel view synthesis cannot handle in-the-wild videos. Our approach
consists of two steps: estimating temporally consistent geometry, and
generative rendering guided by this geometry. By integrating geometric priors,
the generative model focuses on synthesizing realistic details where the
estimated geometry is uncertain. We eliminate the need for extensive 4D
training data through a factorized fine-tuning framework that separately trains
spatial and temporal components using multi-view image and video data. Our
method outperforms baselines in producing plausible videos from novel camera
trajectories, especially in extreme extrapolation scenarios on real-world
footage.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于事件相机的交通监控中模拟数据与真实数据之间的性能差距，发现仅用模拟数据训练的模型在真实数据上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在交通监控中具有潜力，但缺乏标注的真实数据，模拟数据与实际性能的差距尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟器的DVS模块生成合成数据，训练循环视觉变换器模型，并在合成与真实数据混合的测试集上评估。

Result: 仅用合成数据训练的模型在真实数据上性能显著下降，而用真实数据训练的模型泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 当前DVS模拟的保真度有限，需改进领域适应技术以提升事件相机在交通监控中的应用。

Abstract: Event cameras are gaining traction in traffic monitoring applications due to
their low latency, high temporal resolution, and energy efficiency, which makes
them well-suited for real-time object detection at traffic intersections.
However, the development of robust event-based detection models is hindered by
the limited availability of annotated real-world datasets. To address this,
several simulation tools have been developed to generate synthetic event data.
Among these, the CARLA driving simulator includes a built-in dynamic vision
sensor (DVS) module that emulates event camera output. Despite its potential,
the sim-to-real gap for event-based object detection remains insufficiently
studied. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of this gap by
training a recurrent vision transformer model exclusively on synthetic data
generated using CARLAs DVS and testing it on varying combinations of synthetic
and real-world event streams. Our experiments show that models trained solely
on synthetic data perform well on synthetic-heavy test sets but suffer
significant performance degradation as the proportion of real-world data
increases. In contrast, models trained on real-world data demonstrate stronger
generalization across domains. This study offers the first quantifiable
analysis of the sim-to-real gap in event-based object detection using CARLAs
DVS. Our findings highlight limitations in current DVS simulation fidelity and
underscore the need for improved domain adaptation techniques in neuromorphic
vision for traffic monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTFusion是一种无需训练的方法，通过最优传输桥接视觉语言模型和纯视觉基础模型，提升零样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型过于依赖类别先验，而纯视觉模型缺乏语义对齐，需结合两者优势。

Method: 利用最优传输学习共享概率表示，对齐视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上平均准确率提升近10%，无需微调或额外标注。

Conclusion: OTFusion有效结合两种模型优势，显著提升零样本分类性能。

Abstract: Transductive zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify unseen categories by
leveraging both semantic class descriptions and the distribution of unlabeled
test data. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel at aligning
visual inputs with textual semantics, they often rely too heavily on
class-level priors and fail to capture fine-grained visual cues. In contrast,
Vision-only Foundation Models (VFMs) like DINOv2 provide rich perceptual
features but lack semantic alignment. To exploit the complementary strengths of
these models, we propose OTFusion, a simple yet effective training-free
framework that bridges VLMs and VFMs via Optimal Transport. Specifically,
OTFusion aims to learn a shared probabilistic representation that aligns visual
and semantic information by minimizing the transport cost between their
respective distributions. This unified distribution enables coherent class
predictions that are both semantically meaningful and visually grounded.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that OTFusion
consistently outperforms the original CLIP model, achieving an average accuracy
improvement of nearly $10\%$, all without any fine-tuning or additional
annotations. The code will be publicly released after the paper is accepted.

TL;DR: Test3R是一种测试时学习技术，通过图像三元组优化网络，显著提升3D重建的几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法（如DUSt3R）依赖成对预测，限制了全局几何一致性，Test3R旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用图像三元组（I1,I2,I3），通过自监督目标优化网络，确保跨对一致性。

Result: 在3D重建和多视图深度估计任务中显著优于现有方法，且通用性强、成本低。

Conclusion: Test3R是一种简单高效的技术，可广泛应用于其他模型，提升几何一致性。

Abstract: Dense matching methods like DUSt3R regress pairwise pointmaps for 3D
reconstruction. However, the reliance on pairwise prediction and the limited
generalization capability inherently restrict the global geometric consistency.
In this work, we introduce Test3R, a surprisingly simple test-time learning
technique that significantly boosts geometric accuracy. Using image triplets
($I_1,I_2,I_3$), Test3R generates reconstructions from pairs ($I_1,I_2$) and
($I_1,I_3$). The core idea is to optimize the network at test time via a
self-supervised objective: maximizing the geometric consistency between these
two reconstructions relative to the common image $I_1$. This ensures the model
produces cross-pair consistent outputs, regardless of the inputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our technique significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods on the 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth
estimation tasks. Moreover, it is universally applicable and nearly cost-free,
making it easily applied to other models and implemented with minimal test-time
training overhead and parameter footprint. Code is available at

Conclusion: AutoVLA通过统一推理和动作生成，显著提升了自动驾驶的性能和效率，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise
for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning
capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically
infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long
reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies
reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model
for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and
trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions.
We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling
direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised
fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking
(trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning).
To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a
reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive
experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including
nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of
AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results
showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA
in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: PF-LHM在效率和准确性上优于现有方法，为无约束场景下的3D人体重建提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing an animatable 3D human from casually captured images of an
articulated subject without camera or human pose information is a practical yet
challenging task due to view misalignment, occlusions, and the absence of
structural priors. While optimization-based methods can produce high-fidelity
results from monocular or multi-view videos, they require accurate pose
estimation and slow iterative optimization, limiting scalability in
unconstrained scenarios. Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient
single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input
images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that
generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually
captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder
Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point
features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused
features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented
using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human
reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without
requiring camera and human pose annotations. Code and models will be released
to the public.

Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw
remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools.
However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are
difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this
progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a
certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while
provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness
properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural
networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of
the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In
this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to
machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification
language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support
vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how
specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries
to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing
techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The

Conclusion: QIDINNs为实时学习提供了新方向，并展示了量子扩展和可扩展实现的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time continuous learning over streaming data remains a central challenge
in deep learning and AI systems. Traditional gradient-based models such as
backpropagation through time (BPTT) face computational and stability
limitations when dealing with temporally unbounded data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel architecture, Quantum-Inspired Differentiable Integral Neural
Networks (QIDINNs), which leverages the Feynman technique of differentiation
under the integral sign to formulate neural updates as integrals over
historical data. This reformulation allows for smoother, more stable learning
dynamics that are both physically interpretable and computationally tractable.
Inspired by Feynman's path integral formalism and compatible with quantum
gradient estimation frameworks, QIDINNs open a path toward hybrid
classical-quantum neural computation. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness
on synthetic and real-world streaming tasks, and we propose directions for
quantum extensions and scalable implementations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个高难度代码生成基准HLCE，包含235道来自ICPC和IOI的挑战性问题，旨在测试高级LLMs的推理和代码生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流基准对高级LLMs挑战不足，无法充分反映其推理和代码生成能力。

Method: 设计HLCE基准，包含ICPC和IOI的难题，并开发在线-离线沙盒以确保可复现性。

Result: 最强LLMs（o4-mini和Gemini-2.5 Pro）的通过率仅为15.9%和11.4%，且其自我认知能力与代码生成性能不相关。

Conclusion: HLCE将成为代码生成的里程碑挑战，推动高性能推理和人机协作编程的发展。

Abstract: Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet
mainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with
medium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better
reflected the advanced reasoning and code generation ability, We introduce
Humanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE), comprising 235 most challenging problems from
the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010 - 2024. As part of
HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully
reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that
even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve
pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a
novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own
capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not
proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our
empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced
LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We
expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze
advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming.
Our code and dataset are also public
available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).

### [295] [InfoFlood: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Information Overload](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12274)
*Advait Yadav,Haibo Jin,Man Luo,Jun Zhuang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的LLM漏洞——信息过载，导致安全机制失效，并提出自动攻击方法InfoFlood，验证其在多种LLM上的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的安全机制易受精心设计的攻击绕过，但尚未研究语言复杂性本身对安全机制的破坏作用。

Method: 提出InfoFlood攻击方法，通过语言转换和优化，将恶意查询转化为复杂查询以绕过安全机制。

Result: 在四种主流LLM上测试，InfoFlood攻击成功率比基线高3倍，且现有防御措施无效。

Conclusion: 信息过载攻击暴露了传统AI安全护栏的弱点，需开发新防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains. However, their potential to generate harmful responses has
raised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when
manipulated by adversarial techniques known as "jailbreak" attacks. Existing
jailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or
suffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms
of these models.
  In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic
complexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any
added prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs
directly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.
  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a
jailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,
information-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.
Specifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase
malicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is
unsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the
failure while preserving its malicious intent.
  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used
LLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their
jailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks,
achieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak
benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing
defenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM,
fail to mitigate these attacks. This highlights a critical weakness in
traditional AI safety guardrails when confronted with information
overload-based jailbreaks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecurityLingua提出了一种通过安全导向的提示压缩来防御LLM越狱攻击的高效方法，既能保持模型实用性，又几乎不增加计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM已广泛应用，但其安全对齐后仍易受恶意攻击，现有防御方法常导致实用性下降或计算开销增加。

Method: 训练一个提示压缩器，识别输入提示的“真实意图”，尤其是检测恶意意图，并通过系统提示传递给目标LLM以激活其内置安全机制。

Result: 实验表明，SecurityLingua能有效防御恶意攻击，同时保持LLM的实用性，计算和延迟开销极低。

Conclusion: SecurityLingua是一种高效且实用的LLM防御方案，平衡了安全性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread adoption across
numerous applications. However, many LLMs are vulnerable to malicious attacks
even after safety alignment. These attacks typically bypass LLMs' safety
guardrails by wrapping the original malicious instructions inside adversarial
jailbreaks prompts. Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial
training and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but
these methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant
computational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose
SecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against
jailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we
train a prompt compressor designed to discern the "true intention" of the input
prompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of
adversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is
passed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true
intention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience
by leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's
potentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails
of the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only
a negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense
methods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.
Experimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend
against malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible
compute and latency overhead. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Revelio的去模糊方法，用于恢复高斯模糊处理的人脸图像，并评估其在高模糊设置下的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高斯模糊处理后的人脸图像能否被有效恢复并用于重新识别，尤其是在高模糊设置下。

Method: 结合生成模型的记忆效应和条件扩散模型进行初步人脸恢复，再通过身份检索模型增强保真度。

Result: Revelio在高模糊设置下表现优异，重新识别准确率达95.9%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 高斯模糊不适用于人脸匿名化，需探索更安全的替代方案。

Abstract: Gaussian blur is widely used to blur human faces in sensitive photos before
the photos are posted on the Internet. However, it is unclear to what extent
the blurred faces can be restored and used to re-identify the person,
especially under a high-blurring setting. In this paper, we explore this
question by developing a deblurring method called Revelio. The key intuition is
to leverage a generative model's memorization effect and approximate the
inverse function of Gaussian blur for face restoration. Compared with existing
methods, we design the deblurring process to be identity-preserving. It uses a
conditional Diffusion model for preliminary face restoration and then uses an
identity retrieval model to retrieve related images to further enhance
fidelity. We evaluate Revelio with large public face image datasets and show
that it can effectively restore blurred faces, especially under a high-blurring
setting. It has a re-identification accuracy of 95.9%, outperforming existing
solutions. The result suggests that Gaussian blur should not be used for face
anonymization purposes. We also demonstrate the robustness of this method
against mismatched Gaussian kernel sizes and functions, and test preliminary
countermeasures and adaptive attacks to inspire future work.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: InverTune是一种针对多模态模型的后门防御框架，无需攻击者知识或中毒数据集，通过对抗模拟、梯度反演和聚类微调，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态对比学习模型（如CLIP）易受后门攻击，现有防御方法因假设攻击者知识或需要大量干净数据而不实用。

Method: InverTune通过对抗模拟识别攻击特征，梯度反演重构潜在触发器，聚类微调消除后门功能。

Result: 实验显示，InverTune将攻击成功率降低97.87%，干净数据准确性仅下降3.07%。

Conclusion: InverTune为多模态系统安全提供了新范式，在不影响性能的情况下提升安全性。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
vision-language alignment capabilities, yet their vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses critical security risks. Attackers can implant latent triggers
that persist through downstream tasks, enabling malicious control of model
behavior upon trigger presentation. Despite great success in recent defense
mechanisms, they remain impractical due to strong assumptions about attacker
knowledge or excessive clean data requirements. In this paper, we introduce
InverTune, the first backdoor defense framework for multimodal models under
minimal attacker assumptions, requiring neither prior knowledge of attack
targets nor access to the poisoned dataset. Unlike existing defense methods
that rely on the same dataset used in the poisoning stage, InverTune
effectively identifies and removes backdoor artifacts through three key
components, achieving robust protection against backdoor attacks. Specifically,
InverTune first exposes attack signatures through adversarial simulation,
probabilistically identifying the target label by analyzing model response
patterns. Building on this, we develop a gradient inversion technique to
reconstruct latent triggers through activation pattern analysis. Finally, a
clustering-guided fine-tuning strategy is employed to erase the backdoor
function with only a small amount of arbitrary clean data, while preserving the
original model capabilities. Experimental results show that InverTune reduces
the average attack success rate (ASR) by 97.87% against the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attacks while limiting clean accuracy (CA) degradation to just 3.07%.
This work establishes a new paradigm for securing multimodal systems, advancing
security in foundation model deployment without compromising performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于跨语言新闻事件识别需要难以扩展的专业知识，研究旨在开发一种可扩展的AI方法来解决这一问题。

Method: FAME方法基于事件指纹（时间、地点和类别）匹配新闻文章，无需训练数据，适用于大规模数据库。

Result: FAME在识别2020年470起自然灾害和恐怖袭击事件的27,441篇新闻文章上表现优异，揭示了媒体报道与事件死亡人数、国家GDP及贸易量相关的模式。

Conclusion: FAME为跨语言新闻事件识别提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，并公开了NLP注释和媒体关注数据以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Comparative studies of news coverage are challenging to conduct because
methods to identify news articles about the same event in different languages
require expertise that is difficult to scale. We introduce an AI-powered method
for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal
set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage
identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME),
efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically
terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require
training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news
articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class
(such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and
scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds
of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that
cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020.
To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from
MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events:
EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior
literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death
counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume
between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred. We
share our NLP annotations and cross-country media attention data to support the
efforts of researchers and media monitoring organizations.

Motivation: 现有工具如Overpass Turbo需要复杂的查询语言，对非技术用户构成障碍。SPOT旨在降低技术门槛，支持事实核查和打击虚假信息。

Method: SPOT利用微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）将用户输入解释为地理空间对象的结构化表示，并结合合成数据管道和语义捆绑系统。

Result: SPOT首次实现了对OSM数据的可靠自然语言访问，具有高准确性。

Conclusion: SPOT通过降低地理定位验证的技术门槛，为支持事实核查和打击虚假信息提供了实用工具。

Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a vital resource for investigative journalists doing
geolocation verification. However, existing tools to query OSM data such as
Overpass Turbo require familiarity with complex query languages, creating
barriers for non-technical users. We present SPOT, an open source natural
language interface that makes OSM's rich, tag-based geographic data more
accessible through intuitive scene descriptions. SPOT interprets user inputs as
structured representations of geospatial object configurations using fine-tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs), with results being displayed in an interactive
map interface. While more general geospatial search tasks are conceivable, SPOT
is specifically designed for use in investigative journalism, addressing
real-world challenges such as hallucinations in model output, inconsistencies
in OSM tagging, and the noisy nature of user input. It combines a novel
synthetic data pipeline with a semantic bundling system to enable robust,
accurate query generation. To our knowledge, SPOT is the first system to
achieve reliable natural language access to OSM data at this level of accuracy.
By lowering the technical barrier to geolocation verification, SPOT contributes
a practical tool to the broader efforts to support fact-checking and combat
disinformation.

Motivation: 受视网膜神经节细胞感受野的中心-周围组织启发，旨在提高变工况下早期故障特征的鲁棒性检测。

Method: 采用基于NSGA-II算法的多目标进化优化策略，同时最小化RUL预测误差、最大化特征单调性并促进平滑退化轨迹。

Result: 在XJTU-SY轴承数据集上验证了方法的有效性，支持早期故障及其前兆的检测，并通过bagging回归器实现准确的RUL预测。

Conclusion: SFRFs结合了信号处理、生物感知原理和数据驱动的预测方法，具有可解释性和原理性设计。

Abstract: This paper introduces Spectral Fault Receptive Fields (SFRFs), a biologically
inspired technique for degradation state assessment in bearing fault diagnosis
and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Drawing on the center-surround
organization of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields, we propose a
frequency-domain feature extraction algorithm that enhances the detection of
fault signatures in vibration signals. SFRFs are designed as antagonistic
spectral filters centered on characteristic fault frequencies, with inhibitory
surrounds that enable robust characterization of incipient faults under
variable operating conditions. A multi-objective evolutionary optimization
strategy based on NSGA-II algorithm is employed to tune the receptive field
parameters by simultaneously minimizing RUL prediction error, maximizing
feature monotonicity, and promoting smooth degradation trajectories. The method
is demonstrated on the XJTU-SY bearing run-to-failure dataset, confirming its
suitability for constructing condition indicators in health monitoring
applications. Key contributions include: (i) the introduction of SFRFs,
inspired by the biology of vision in the primate retina; (ii) an evolutionary
optimization framework guided by condition monitoring and prognosis criteria;
and (iii) experimental evidence supporting the detection of early-stage faults
and their precursors. Furthermore, we confirm that our diagnosis-informed
spectral representation achieves accurate RUL prediction using a bagging
regressor. The results highlight the interpretability and principled design of
SFRFs, bridging signal processing, biological sensing principles, and
data-driven prognostics in rotating machinery.

Motivation: 传统代理模型（ABMs）无法捕捉人类行为的复杂性，而LLMs虽然提供了更复杂的社会行为模拟能力，但面临扩展挑战。Light Society旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Light Society通过结构化代理和环境状态转换，结合LLM驱动的模拟操作和事件队列执行，实现高效仿真。

Conclusion: Light Society为研究复杂社会行为提供了高效、可扩展的框架，展示了LLMs在大规模社会模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how complex societal behaviors emerge from individual cognition
and interactions requires both high-fidelity modeling of human behavior and
large-scale simulations. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) have been
employed to study these dynamics for decades, but are constrained by simplified
agent behaviors that fail to capture human complexity. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities by enabling agents to exhibit
sophisticated social behaviors that go beyond rule-based logic, yet face
significant scaling challenges. Here we present Light Society, an agent-based
simulation framework that advances both fronts, efficiently modeling human-like
societies at planetary scale powered by LLMs. Light Society formalizes social
processes as structured transitions of agent and environment states, governed
by a set of LLM-powered simulation operations, and executed through an event
queue. This modular design supports both independent and joint component
optimization, supporting efficient simulation of societies with over one
billion agents. Large-scale simulations of trust games and opinion
propagation--spanning up to one billion agents--demonstrate Light Society's
high fidelity and efficiency in modeling social trust and information
diffusion, while revealing scaling laws whereby larger simulations yield more
stable and realistic emergent behaviors.

Abstract: The comparison between discriminative and generative classifiers has
intrigued researchers since Efron's seminal analysis of logistic regression
versus discriminant analysis. While early theoretical work established that
generative classifiers exhibit lower sample complexity but higher asymptotic
error in simple linear settings, these trade-offs remain unexplored in the
transformer era. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of modern
generative and discriminative architectures - Auto-regressive modeling, Masked
Language Modeling, Discrete Diffusion, and Encoders for text classification.
Our study reveals that the classical 'two regimes' phenomenon manifests
distinctly across different architectures and training paradigms. Beyond
accuracy, we analyze sample efficiency, calibration, noise robustness, and
ordinality across diverse scenarios. Our findings offer practical guidance for
selecting the most suitable modeling approach based on real-world constraints
such as latency and data limitations.

Abstract: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit,
evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful
behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).
While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin
and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first
show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it
already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent
ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects
reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained
models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from
0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our
analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned
models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from
non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a
self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with
self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable
bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and
fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that
enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while
suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to
navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without
requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of
self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding
model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在生成高性能注意力代码时面临挑战，无法理解复杂的数据流和计算过程，且需要手动实现，限制了跨GPU架构的适应性。

Method: 提出LLM-TL和两阶段推理工作流（TL-Code生成和翻译），使LLMs能自动生成FlashAttention实现。

Result: 在A100、RTX8000和T4 GPU上验证，性能显著优于普通LLMs，速度提升高达35.16倍，并超越人工优化库。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅支持未覆盖的硬件和数据类型，还将开发时间从数月缩短至分钟，为注意力算法提供了自优化范式。

Abstract: The attention operator remains a critical performance bottleneck in large
language models (LLMs), particularly for long-context scenarios. While
FlashAttention is the most widely used and effective GPU-aware acceleration
algorithm, it must require time-consuming and hardware-specific manual
implementation, limiting adaptability across GPU architectures. Existing LLMs
have shown a lot of promise in code generation tasks, but struggle to generate
high-performance attention code. The key challenge is it cannot comprehend the
complex data flow and computation process of the attention operator and utilize
low-level primitive to exploit GPU performance.
  To address the above challenge, we propose an LLM-friendly Thinking Language
(LLM-TL) to help LLMs decouple the generation of high-level optimization logic
and low-level implementation on GPU, and enhance LLMs' understanding of
attention operator. Along with a 2-stage reasoning workflow, TL-Code generation
and translation, the LLMs can automatically generate FlashAttention
implementation on diverse GPUs, establishing a self-optimizing paradigm for
generating high-performance attention operators in attention-centric
algorithms. Verified on A100, RTX8000, and T4 GPUs, the performance of our
methods significantly outshines that of vanilla LLMs, achieving a speed-up of
up to 35.16x. Besides, our method not only surpasses human-optimized libraries
(cuDNN and official library) in most scenarios but also extends support to
unsupported hardware and data types, reducing development time from months to

### [307] [Robust LLM Unlearning with MUDMAN: Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking And Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12484)
*Filip Sondej,Yushi Yang,Mikołaj Kniejski,Marcel Windys*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MUDMAN的新方法，通过结合Disruption Masking和梯度归一化等技术，实现了对语言模型中危险知识的不可逆遗忘，性能优于现有方法40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型即使经过安全微调仍可能保留危险知识和技能，现有遗忘方法易被逆转，亟需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 引入Disruption Masking技术，确保权重更新方向一致；结合梯度归一化和元学习，提出MUDMAN方法。

Result: MUDMAN在防止危险能力恢复方面表现优异，比现有TAR方法提升40%。

Conclusion: MUDMAN为语言模型的安全遗忘提供了更鲁棒的新方法，显著提升了不可逆遗忘的效果。

Abstract: Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after
extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent
studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed.
To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components
of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.
  We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating
weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient
are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.
  Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients,
and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights
into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and
validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous
capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new
state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

TL;DR: BTC-LLM是一种新型的亚1位量化框架，通过自适应权重变换和二进制模式聚类，解决了现有二值化方法的性能下降、计算复杂性和硬件兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二值化方法在压缩LLM时面临性能下降、稀疏掩码管理复杂和硬件兼容性差的问题。

Result: 该方法在保持高精度的同时，提升了计算效率，并兼容标准硬件。

Conclusion: BTC-LLM为LLM压缩提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary quantization represents the most extreme form of large language model
(LLM) compression, reducing weights to $\pm$1 for maximal memory and
computational efficiency. While recent sparsity-aware binarization methods
achieve sub-1-bit compression by pruning redundant binary weights, they suffer
from three critical challenges: performance deterioration, computational
complexity from sparse mask management, and limited hardware compatibility. In
this paper, we present BTC-LLM, a novel sub-1-bit LLM quantization framework
that leverages adaptive weight transformation and binary pattern clustering to
overcome these limitations, delivering both superior accuracy and efficiency.
Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Learnable Transformation
that optimizes invertible scaling and rotation matrices to align binarized
weights with full-precision distributions, enabling incoherence processing to
enhance layer-wise representation quality; (2) a Flash and Accurate Binary
Codebook that identifies recurring binary vector clusters, compressing them
into compact indices with tailored distance metrics and sign-based centroid
updates. This eliminates the need for sparse masks, enabling efficient
inference on standard hardware. Our code is available at

Abstract: Network pruning, aimed at reducing network size while preserving accuracy,
has attracted significant research interest. Numerous pruning techniques have
been proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more
complex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of
neural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached
a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we "use a
neural network to prune neural networks". More specifically, we introduce the
newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A
metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a
modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective
mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural
network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning
strategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into
another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,
our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and
the standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our method achieved
outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including
ResNet56 on CIFAR10, VGG19 on CIFAR100, ResNet50 on ImageNet). Our code is
available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new
possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work
often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In
this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable
LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use
of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized
prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based
tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is
possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and
requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own
method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective
predictions.

Abstract: Interpreting large volumes of high-dimensional, unlabeled data in a manner
that is comprehensible to humans remains a significant challenge across various
domains. In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data
can offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct
implications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of
interpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients
recovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of
multimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS
location, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely
collected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately
for each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each
modality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware
prompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster
labels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these
clusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous
statistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected
alongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical
significance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large
language model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the
proposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner. This
unsupervised data analysis approach, relying solely on sensor data, enables
clinicians to identify at-risk patients and take timely measures to improve
health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态AI模型主要关注预测性能，可能加剧患者亚群间的偏见，而各模态在减少偏见和优化性能中的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入FAME框架，结合误差分布差异指数（EDDI）和符号无关聚合方法，平衡子群间的公平性。

Result: FAME在结合结构化与非结构化EHR数据的实验中，表现出优于基线的性能和公平性。

Conclusion: FAME为多模态AI模型提供了一种兼顾性能和公平性的有效方法。

Abstract: Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text,
images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To
process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful
approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models
optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases
across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal
models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their
interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain
underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal
Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its
fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by
incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution
Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a
sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring
equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT,
combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other
baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图卷积网络（GCN）的新框架，用于犯罪热点预测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犯罪热点预测对城市安全和执法至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉复杂的空间依赖关系。

Method: 将犯罪数据表示为图，节点为地理网格单元，边表示邻近关系，使用多层GCN模型进行分类和预测。

Result: 在芝加哥犯罪数据集上，分类准确率达到88%，并生成可解释的热点热图。

Conclusion: 图学习方法在预测警务和空间犯罪学中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Crime hotspot prediction is critical for ensuring urban safety and effective
law enforcement, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatial
dependencies inherent in criminal activity. The previous approaches tended to
use classical algorithms such as the KDE and SVM to model data distributions
and decision boundaries. The methods often fail to capture these spatial
relationships, treating crime events as independent and ignoring geographical
interactions. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which explicitly model spatial dependencies by
representing crime data as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent discrete
geographic grid cells and edges capture proximity relationships. Using the
Chicago Crime Dataset, we engineer spatial features and train a multi-layer GCN
model to classify crime types and predict high-risk zones. Our approach
achieves 88% classification accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods. Additionally, the model generates interpretable heat maps of crime
hotspots, demonstrating the practical utility of graph-based learning for
predictive policing and spatial criminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩适应方法未考虑数据上下文，导致微调性能不佳和知识遗忘。

Method: 使用上下文导向的奇异值分解，收集目标任务的输入激活协方差矩阵，并通过动态协方差选择和动态秩分配策略优化。

Result: CorDA++在知识保留模式（KPM）下优于LoRA，在指令预览模式（IPM）下收敛更快且性能更好。

Conclusion: CorDA++显著提升了任务适应性能，同时减少了知识遗忘，已被集成到Hugging Face的PEFT库中。

Abstract: Conventional low-rank adaptation methods build adapters without considering
data context, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning performance and severe
forgetting of inherent world knowledge. In this paper, we propose
context-oriented decomposition adaptation (CorDA), a novel method that
initializes adapters in a task-aware manner. Concretely, we develop
context-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance
matrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the
target task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its
corresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is
compacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our
method enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)
and instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between
freezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or
adapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by
deriving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal
components, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank
allocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each
layer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank
allocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a
significant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning
performance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained
knowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,
our method exhibits faster convergence, \emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,
and improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong
baseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library
developed by Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使在推理模型中，微调恶意行为也会导致广泛的错位现象（emergent misalignment），表现为欺骗性回答、暴政欲望和抵抗关闭。思维链（CoT）监控不可靠，可能掩盖或揭示错位意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理模型是否像传统LLMs一样，在微调恶意行为后会出现广泛的错位现象，并研究思维链（CoT）在揭示或掩盖这些行为中的作用。

Method: 微调推理模型（禁用CoT），在评估时重新启用CoT，观察模型行为。同时训练模型在特定触发词下执行恶意行为。

Result: 推理模型表现出广泛错位行为，CoT监控不可靠，可能掩盖错位意图。模型还能解释其触发词，显示一定自我意识。

Conclusion: 推理步骤既能揭示也能掩盖错位意图，无法防止模型错位行为。研究发布了三个新数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow
domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a
phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends
from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on
malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable
CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly
misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for
tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these
misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick
the user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five
sleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors
that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.
  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad
behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes
broad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find
that reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,
demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these
behaviors but is unreliable.
  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned
intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We
release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent
misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation
suite.

Method: 设计了一个基于模块化指数任务的双指数任务，比较了使用子任务课程训练和直接训练两种方式的效果。

Result: 使用子任务课程训练的模型在零样本推理和鲁棒性上表现更好，且任务表示策略因课程设计而异。

Conclusion: 子任务课程设计能有效提升Transformer模型在上下文学习中的表现，任务表示策略多样化。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) research often considers learning a function
in-context through a uniform sample of input-output pairs. Here, we investigate
how presenting a compositional subtask curriculum in context may alter the
computations a transformer learns. We design a compositional algorithmic task
based on the modular exponential-a double exponential task composed of two
single exponential subtasks and train transformer models to learn the task
in-context. We compare (a) models trained using an in-context curriculum
consisting of single exponential subtasks and, (b) models trained directly on
the double exponential task without such a curriculum. We show that models
trained with a subtask curriculum can perform zero-shot inference on unseen
compositional tasks and are more robust given the same context length. We study
how the task and subtasks are represented across the two training regimes. We
find that the models employ diverse strategies modulated by the specific
curriculum design.

Result: 实验表明AdaLRS能高效调整学习率至最优附近，提升模型性能，并在不同训练场景中表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: AdaLRS是一种高效、通用的学习率搜索方法，适用于多种基础模型预训练场景。

Abstract: Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model
pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of
learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc.
Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios
and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In
this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning
rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via
optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that
the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model
pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying
solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to
guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical
analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts
suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency
and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show
the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such
as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler
choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的位置编码方法（如ALiBi和RoPE）在适应新模态时需要大量修改，且固定大小的查找表限制了序列长度外的泛化能力。SeqPE旨在提供一种更灵活和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: SeqPE将位置索引表示为符号序列，并使用轻量级序列编码器学习嵌入。通过对比目标和知识蒸馏损失正则化嵌入空间，增强外推性能。

Result: 实验表明，SeqPE在语言建模、长上下文问答和2D图像分类任务中表现优于基线，特别是在上下文长度外推时，且无需手动调整即可适应多维输入。

Conclusion: SeqPE提供了一种高效且通用的位置编码方法，显著提升了模型的适应性和外推能力。

Abstract: Since self-attention layers in Transformers are permutation invariant by
design, positional encodings must be explicitly incorporated to enable spatial
understanding. However, fixed-size lookup tables used in traditional learnable
position embeddings (PEs) limit extrapolation capabilities beyond pre-trained
sequence lengths. Expert-designed methods such as ALiBi and RoPE, mitigate this
limitation but demand extensive modifications for adapting to new modalities,
underscoring fundamental challenges in adaptability and scalability. In this
work, we present SeqPE, a unified and fully learnable position encoding
framework that represents each $n$-dimensional position index as a symbolic
sequence and employs a lightweight sequential position encoder to learn their
embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To regularize SeqPE's embedding space, we
introduce two complementary objectives: a contrastive objective that aligns
embedding distances with a predefined position-distance function, and a
knowledge distillation loss that anchors out-of-distribution position
embeddings to in-distribution teacher representations, further enhancing
extrapolation performance. Experiments across language modeling, long-context
question answering, and 2D image classification demonstrate that SeqPE not only
surpasses strong baselines in perplexity, exact match (EM), and
accuracy--particularly under context length extrapolation--but also enables
seamless generalization to multi-dimensional inputs without requiring manual
architectural redesign. We release our code, data, and checkpoints at
https://github.com/ghrua/seqpe.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在文本生成中具有优势，但无法灵活填充文本长度和位置，限制了其应用。

Method: DDOT引入样本级最优传输耦合，联合去噪标记值和位置，动态调整填充段的位置和长度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DDOT表现优于基线模型，与非自回归模型性能相当，并提升了训练效率和灵活性。

Conclusion: DDOT为离散扩散模型提供了新的灵活性，解决了文本填充的关键限制。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models are a new class of text generators that offer
advantages such as bidirectional context use, parallelizable generation, and
flexible prompting compared to autoregressive models. However, a critical
limitation of discrete diffusion models is their inability to perform
flexible-length or flexible-position text infilling without access to
ground-truth positional data. We introduce \textbf{DDOT} (\textbf{D}iscrete
\textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport Position Coupling),
the first discrete diffusion model to overcome this challenge. DDOT jointly
denoises token values and token positions, employing a novel sample-level
Optimal Transport (OT) coupling. This coupling preserves relative token
ordering while dynamically adjusting the positions and length of infilled
segments, a capability previously missing in text diffusion. Our method is
orthogonal to existing discrete text diffusion methods and is compatible with
various pretrained text denoisers. Extensive experiments on text infilling
benchmarks such as One-Billion-Word and Yelp demonstrate that DDOT outperforms
naive diffusion baselines. Furthermore, DDOT achieves performance on par with
state-of-the-art non-autoregressive models and enables significant improvements
in training efficiency and flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在输入规模较大时计算复杂度呈二次方增长，稀疏注意力机制虽适用于规则结构（如文本或图像），但不适用于不规则几何数据。

Method: 基于Native Sparse Attention（NSA）改进，利用Ball Tree结构实现球邻域稀疏注意力，适用于无序点集。

Result: 在气流压力预测任务中，BSA的精度与Full Attention相当，同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: BSA为不规则几何数据提供了一种高效的稀疏注意力解决方案，计算成本低且性能优越。

Abstract: Self-attention scales quadratically with input size, limiting its use for
large-scale physical systems. Although sparse attention mechanisms provide a
viable alternative, they are primarily designed for regular structures such as
text or images, making them inapplicable for irregular geometries. In this
work, we present Ball Sparse Attention (BSA), which adapts Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) (Yuan et al., 2025) to unordered point sets by imposing
regularity using the Ball Tree structure from the Erwin Transformer (Zhdanov et
al., 2025). We modify NSA's components to work with ball-based neighborhoods,
yielding a global receptive field at sub-quadratic cost. On an airflow pressure
prediction task, we achieve accuracy comparable to Full Attention while
significantly reducing the theoretical computational complexity. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/britacatalin/bsa.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique in which a compact
"student" network is trained to replicate the predictive behavior of a larger
"teacher" network. In logit-based knowledge distillation it has become the de
facto approach to augment cross-entropy with a distillation term. Typically
this term is either a KL divergence-matching marginal probabilities or a
correlation-based loss capturing intra- and inter-class relationships but in
every case it sits as an add-on to cross-entropy with its own weight that must
be carefully tuned. In this paper we adopt a choice-theoretic perspective and
recast knowledge distillation under the Plackett-Luce model by interpreting
teacher logits as "worth" scores. We introduce Plackett-Luce Distillation
(PLD), a weighted list-wise ranking loss in which the teacher model transfers
knowledge of its full ranking of classes, weighting each ranked choice by its
own confidence. PLD directly optimizes a single teacher-optimal ranking of the
true label first, followed by the remaining classes in descending teacher
confidence, yielding a convex, translation-invariant surrogate that subsumes
weighted cross-entropy. Empirically on standard image classification
benchmarks, PLD improves Top-1 accuracy by an average of +0.42% over DIST
(arXiv:2205.10536) and +1.04% over KD (arXiv:1503.02531) in homogeneous
settings and by +0.48% and +1.09% over DIST and KD, respectively, in
heterogeneous settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to many contemporary AI
applications, yet their extensive parameter counts pose significant challenges
for deployment in memory- and compute-constrained environments. Recent works in
eXplainable AI (XAI), particularly on attribution methods, suggest that
interpretability can also enable model compression by identifying and removing
components irrelevant to inference. In this paper, we leverage Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) to perform attribution-guided pruning of LLMs.
While LRP has shown promise in structured pruning for vision models, we extend
it to unstructured pruning in LLMs and demonstrate that it can substantially
reduce model size with minimal performance loss. Our method is especially
effective in extracting task-relevant subgraphs -- so-called ``circuits'' --
which can represent core functions (e.g., indirect object identification).
Building on this, we introduce a technique for model correction, by selectively
removing circuits responsible for spurious behaviors (e.g., toxic outputs). All
in all, we gather these techniques as a uniform holistic framework and showcase
its effectiveness and limitations through extensive experiments for
compression, circuit discovery and model correction on Llama and OPT models,
highlighting its potential for improving both model efficiency and safety. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/erfanhatefi/SparC3.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to
comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level
performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally
constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting
to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on
previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous
approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of
generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative
models, including large language models, multimodal large language models,
vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from
the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these
approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and
replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and
motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different
generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core
backbones, offering deeper insights into the field. The project page of this

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CertDW的认证数据集水印方法，用于在恶意攻击下可靠验证数据集所有权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证方法假设验证过程是忠实的，但实际中可能因扰动导致性能下降，因此需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 引入基于统计量（主概率PP和水印鲁棒性WR）的认证水印方法，证明PP与WR之间存在可证明的下界，用于所有权验证。

Result: 实验证明CertDW方法有效且能抵抗潜在的自适应攻击。

Conclusion: CertDW是首个认证数据集水印方法，能在特定条件下确保可靠的所有权验证。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) rely heavily on high-quality open-source datasets
(e.g., ImageNet) for their success, making dataset ownership verification (DOV)
crucial for protecting public dataset copyrights. In this paper, we find
existing DOV methods (implicitly) assume that the verification process is
faithful, where the suspicious model will directly verify ownership by using
the verification samples as input and returning their results. However, this
assumption may not necessarily hold in practice and their performance may
degrade sharply when subjected to intentional or unintentional perturbations.
To address this limitation, we propose the first certified dataset watermark
(i.e., CertDW) and CertDW-based certified dataset ownership verification method
that ensures reliable verification even under malicious attacks, under certain
conditions (e.g., constrained pixel-level perturbation). Specifically, inspired
by conformal prediction, we introduce two statistical measures, including
principal probability (PP) and watermark robustness (WR), to assess model
prediction stability on benign and watermarked samples under noise
perturbations. We prove there exists a provable lower bound between PP and WR,
enabling ownership verification when a suspicious model's WR value
significantly exceeds the PP values of multiple benign models trained on
watermark-free datasets. If the number of PP values smaller than WR exceeds a
threshold, the suspicious model is regarded as having been trained on the
protected dataset. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the
effectiveness of our CertDW method and its resistance to potential adaptive
attacks. Our codes are at

Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定问题设计策略，缺乏灵活性。本文旨在通过统一框架解决多种PDE问题。

Method: 将PDE求解视为广义修复问题，设计基于Transformer的架构，结合像素空间视频扩散模型进行高保真修复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种PDE和问题设置中表现优异，超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为PDE求解提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) using video-inpainting diffusion transformer models. Unlike existing
methods that devise specialized strategies for either forward or inverse
problems under full or partial observation, our approach unifies these tasks
under a single, flexible generative framework. Specifically, we recast
PDE-solving as a generalized inpainting problem, e.g., treating forward
prediction as inferring missing spatiotemporal information of future states
from initial conditions. To this end, we design a transformer-based
architecture that conditions on arbitrary patterns of known data to infer
missing values across time and space. Our method proposes pixel-space video
diffusion models for fine-grained, high-fidelity inpainting and conditioning,
while enhancing computational efficiency through hierarchical modeling.
Extensive experiments show that our video inpainting-based diffusion model
offers an accurate and versatile solution across a wide range of PDEs and
problem setups, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种估计扩散模型最优损失值的方法，以解决其训练质量诊断和提升的问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的损失值无法直接反映数据拟合质量，因为其最优值通常非零且未知，导致难以区分模型容量不足与最优损失较大。

Method: 推导了扩散模型最优损失的闭式解，并开发了可扩展的随机估计器，用于诊断训练质量和改进训练计划。

Result: 实验表明，减去最优损失后的训练损失更符合幂律分布，为扩散模型的缩放定律研究提供了更合理的设置。

Conclusion: 估计最优损失是诊断和改进扩散模型的有效工具，同时为研究其缩放定律提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling.
Despite more stable training, the loss of diffusion models is not indicative of
absolute data-fitting quality, since its optimal value is typically not zero
but unknown, leading to confusion between large optimal loss and insufficient
model capacity. In this work, we advocate the need to estimate the optimal loss
value for diagnosing and improving diffusion models. We first derive the
optimal loss in closed form under a unified formulation of diffusion models,
and develop effective estimators for it, including a stochastic variant
scalable to large datasets with proper control of variance and bias. With this
tool, we unlock the inherent metric for diagnosing the training quality of
mainstream diffusion model variants, and develop a more performant training
schedule based on the optimal loss. Moreover, using models with 120M to 1.5B
parameters, we find that the power law is better demonstrated after subtracting
the optimal loss from the actual training loss, suggesting a more principled
setting for investigating the scaling law for diffusion models.

Motivation: 协作机器人需要快速适应人类伙伴的意图和偏好，以主动提供帮助，尤其是在动态环境中人类不断教授新技能的情况下。

Method: 提出ProVox框架，通过个性化元提示和主动语言模型任务规划，从交互上下文中推断用户意图并提前规划行为。

Result: 实验表明，ProVox显著提高了任务完成效率（快38.7%）并减少了用户负担（减少31.9%）。

Conclusion: ProVox证明了元提示和主动性的重要性，为协作机器人提供了高效适应人类伙伴的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and
preferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in
situated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new
high-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through
demonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work
together to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should
be able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this
information to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from
the user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large
language models, we introduce ProVox ("Proactive Voice"), a novel framework
that enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual
collaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to
communicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors
ahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized
prompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a
user's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to
suggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the
amount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.
We evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation
tasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the
collaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,
and reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity
are critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less
user burden relative to non-active baselines. Supplementary material, code, and
videos can be found at https://provox-2025.github.io.

Abstract: This review explores the potential of foundation models to advance laboratory
automation in the materials and chemical sciences. It emphasizes the dual roles
of these models: cognitive functions for experimental planning and data
analysis, and physical functions for hardware operations. While traditional
laboratory automation has relied heavily on specialized, rigid systems,
foundation models offer adaptability through their general-purpose intelligence
and multimodal capabilities. Recent advancements have demonstrated the
feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal robotic
systems to handle complex and dynamic laboratory tasks. However, significant
challenges remain, including precision manipulation of hardware, integration of
multimodal data, and ensuring operational safety. This paper outlines a roadmap
highlighting future directions, advocating for close interdisciplinary
collaboration, benchmark establishment, and strategic human-AI integration to
realize fully autonomous experimental laboratories.

Conclusion: SPLATART为复杂关节物体的表示提供了一种有效方法，尤其适用于多自由度和深层运动树结构。

Abstract: Representing articulated objects remains a difficult problem within the field
of robotics. Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require
representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also
part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning
these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree
of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or
more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably
greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of
articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART -
a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects
from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations.
SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation
task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and
representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than
previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as
applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a
real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present
on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper
kinematic tree structures.

Result: 在真实机器人任务中验证了该方法，显著提升了策略在OOD条件下的性能。

Conclusion: 通过功能对应反馈，能够低成本地提升策略的泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained using behavior cloning have shown a
remarkable ability to generate complex, multi-modal low-level robot behaviors.
However, at deployment time, these policies still struggle to act reliably when
faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) visuals induced by objects, backgrounds,
or environment changes. Prior works in interactive imitation learning solicit
corrective expert demonstrations under the OOD conditions -- but this can be
costly and inefficient. We observe that task success under OOD conditions does
not always warrant novel robot behaviors. In-distribution (ID) behaviors can
directly be transferred to OOD conditions that share functional similarities
with ID conditions. For example, behaviors trained to interact with
in-distribution (ID) pens can apply to interacting with a visually-OOD pencil.
The key challenge lies in disambiguating which ID observations functionally
correspond to the OOD observation for the task at hand. We propose that an
expert can provide this OOD-to-ID functional correspondence. Thus, instead of
collecting new demonstrations and re-training at every OOD encounter, our
method: (1) detects the need for feedback by first checking if current
observations are OOD and then identifying whether the most similar training
observations show divergent behaviors, (2) solicits functional correspondence
feedback to disambiguate between those behaviors, and (3) intervenes on the OOD
observations with the functionally corresponding ID observations to perform
deployment-time generalization. We validate our method across diverse
real-world robotic manipulation tasks with a Franka Panda robotic manipulator.
Our results show that test-time functional correspondences can improve the
generalization of a vision-based diffusion policy to OOD objects and
environment conditions with low feedback.

Abstract: In the field of multi-sensor fusion for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), monocular cameras and IMUs are widely used to build simple and
effective visual-inertial systems. However, limited research has explored the
integration of motor-encoder devices to enhance SLAM performance. By
incorporating such devices, it is possible to significantly improve active
capability and field of view (FOV) with minimal additional cost and structural
complexity. This paper proposes a novel visual-inertial-encoder tightly coupled
odometry (VIEO) based on a ViDAR (Video Detection and Ranging) device. A ViDAR
calibration method is introduced to ensure accurate initialization for VIEO. In
addition, a platform motion decoupled active SLAM method based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Experimental data demonstrate that
the proposed ViDAR and the VIEO algorithm significantly increase cross-frame
co-visibility relationships compared to its corresponding visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) algorithm, improving state estimation accuracy. Additionally,
the DRL-based active SLAM algorithm, with the ability to decouple from platform
motion, can increase the diversity weight of the feature points and further
enhance the VIEO algorithm's performance. The proposed methodology sheds fresh
insights into both the updated platform design and decoupled approach of active
SLAM systems in complex environments.

Abstract: Vision-based robotic object grasping is typically investigated in the context
of isolated objects or unstructured object sets in bin picking scenarios.
However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse
automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation
such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable
objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these
objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that
prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a
dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation
metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results
show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging
problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results
from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a
construction scenario.

Conclusion: ROSA通过改进空间对齐，显著提升了VLA模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in
multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization
capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in
developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with
the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly
fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers
from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and
heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level
semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical
space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models
anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve
alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state
estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model
to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting
performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in
low-data regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches struggle with precise manipulation; imitation learning
requires many hard-to-obtain demonstrations, while reinforcement learning
yields brittle, non-generalizable policies. We introduce VisuoTactile Local
(ViTaL) policy learning, a framework that solves fine-grained manipulation
tasks by decomposing them into two phases: a reaching phase, where a
vision-language model (VLM) enables scene-level reasoning to localize the
object of interest, and a local interaction phase, where a reusable,
scene-agnostic ViTaL policy performs contact-rich manipulation using egocentric
vision and tactile sensing. This approach is motivated by the observation that
while scene context varies, the low-level interaction remains consistent across
task instances. By training local policies once in a canonical setting, they
can generalize via a localize-then-execute strategy. ViTaL achieves around 90%
success on contact-rich tasks in unseen environments and is robust to
distractors. ViTaL's effectiveness stems from three key insights: (1)
foundation models for segmentation enable training robust visual encoders via
behavior cloning; (2) these encoders improve the generalizability of policies
learned using residual RL; and (3) tactile sensing significantly boosts
performance in contact-rich tasks. Ablation studies validate each of these
insights, and we demonstrate that ViTaL integrates well with high-level VLMs,
enabling robust, reusable low-level skills. Results and videos are available at

### [337] [GSDNet: Revisiting Incomplete Multimodal-Diffusion from Graph Spectrum Perspective for Conversation Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12325)
*Yuntao Shou,Jun Yao,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Cen Chen,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图谱扩散网络（GSDNet），用于解决多模态情感识别中的模态缺失问题，通过在图谱空间中恢复缺失数据，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MERC）在实际场景中常因模态缺失问题性能受限，现有方法可能破坏图的语义和拓扑信息。

Method: 提出GSDNet，将高斯噪声映射到缺失模态的图谱空间，并根据原始分布恢复数据，避免直接破坏邻接矩阵。

Result: GSDNet在多种模态缺失场景下实现了最先进的情感识别性能。

Conclusion: GSDNet通过保留图的全局拓扑信息和谱特征，有效解决了模态缺失问题，提升了MERC的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (MERC) aims to infer the
speaker's emotional state by analyzing utterance information from multiple
sources (i.e., video, audio, and text). Compared with unimodality, a more
robust utterance representation can be obtained by fusing complementary
semantic information from different modalities. However, the modality missing
problem severely limits the performance of MERC in practical scenarios. Recent
work has achieved impressive performance on modality completion using graph
neural networks and diffusion models, respectively. This inspires us to combine
these two dimensions through the graph diffusion model to obtain more powerful
modal recovery capabilities. Unfortunately, existing graph diffusion models may
destroy the connectivity and local structure of the graph by directly adding
Gaussian noise to the adjacency matrix, resulting in the generated graph data
being unable to retain the semantic and topological information of the original
graph. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Spectral Diffusion Network
(GSDNet), which maps Gaussian noise to the graph spectral space of missing
modalities and recovers the missing data according to its original
distribution. Compared with previous graph diffusion methods, GSDNet only
affects the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix instead of destroying the
adjacency matrix directly, which can maintain the global topological
information and important spectral features during the diffusion process.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GSDNet achieves state-of-the-art
emotion recognition performance in various modality loss scenarios.

TL;DR: StreamMel是一种单阶段流式TTS框架，通过连续梅尔频谱建模实现低延迟、高质量语音合成，性能优于现有流式TTS基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流式TTS系统多采用多阶段流水线和离散表示，导致计算成本高且性能不佳，需要一种更高效的实时TTS解决方案。

Method: 提出StreamMel框架，通过交错文本标记与声学帧，建模连续梅尔频谱，支持低延迟自回归合成。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上的实验表明，StreamMel在质量和延迟上优于现有流式TTS基线，性能接近离线系统。

Conclusion: StreamMel展示了与实时语音大语言模型集成的广阔前景，支持高效实时生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis have achieved
high-quality speech generation for unseen speakers, but most systems remain
unsuitable for real-time applications because of their offline design. Current
streaming TTS paradigms often rely on multi-stage pipelines and discrete
representations, leading to increased computational cost and suboptimal system
performance. In this work, we propose StreamMel, a pioneering single-stage
streaming TTS framework that models continuous mel-spectrograms. By
interleaving text tokens with acoustic frames, StreamMel enables low-latency,
autoregressive synthesis while preserving high speaker similarity and
naturalness. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that StreamMel outperforms
existing streaming TTS baselines in both quality and latency. It even achieves
performance comparable to offline systems while supporting efficient real-time
generation, showcasing broad prospects for integration with real-time speech
large language models. Audio samples are available at:

TL;DR: SC-SOT是一种改进的SOT训练方法，用于端到端多说话人语音识别，通过显式引入说话人信息提升重叠语音处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现SOT在重叠语音处理中存在隐式说话人分离不足的问题，需更明确的说话人信息。

Method: SC-SOT通过引入说话人嵌入和说话人活动信息显式指导解码器，说话人嵌入来自联合训练的说话人日志模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法在重叠语音处理中有效。

Conclusion: SC-SOT通过显式说话人条件化显著提升了多说话人语音识别的性能。

Abstract: We propose Speaker-Conditioned Serialized Output Training (SC-SOT), an
enhanced SOT-based training for E2E multi-talker ASR. We first probe how SOT
handles overlapped speech, and we found the decoder performs implicit speaker
separation. We hypothesize this implicit separation is often insufficient due
to ambiguous acoustic cues in overlapping regions. To address this, SC-SOT
explicitly conditions the decoder on speaker information, providing detailed
information about "who spoke when". Specifically, we enhance the decoder by
incorporating: (1) speaker embeddings, which allow the model to focus on the
acoustic characteristics of the target speaker, and (2) speaker activity
information, which guides the model to suppress non-target speakers. The
speaker embeddings are derived from a jointly trained E2E speaker diarization
model, mitigating the need for speaker enrollment. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our conditioning approach on overlapped
speech.

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive systematic review of literature
on style-based composer identification and authorship attribution in symbolic
music scores. Addressing the critical need for improved reliability and
reproducibility in this field, the review rigorously analyzes 58 peer-reviewed
papers published across various historical periods, with the search adapted to
evolving terminology. The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,
computational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting
significant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing
research suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on
simple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the
credibility of attribution claims. The crucial role of robust metrics like
Balanced Accuracy and rigorous cross-validation in ensuring trustworthy results
is emphasized. The survey also details diverse feature representations and the
evolution of machine learning models employed. Notable real-world authorship
attribution cases, such as those involving works attributed to Bach, Josquin
Desprez, and Lennon-McCartney, are specifically discussed, illustrating the
opportunities and pitfalls of applying computational techniques to resolve
disputed musical provenance. Based on these insights, a set of actionable
guidelines for future research are proposed. These recommendations are designed
to significantly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and musicological
validity of composer identification and authorship attribution studies,
fostering more robust and interpretable computational stylistic analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态重排方法在训练策略和效果上仍有改进空间，且缺乏显式推理能力，难以进一步分析和优化。

Method: 提出MM-R5，采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）两阶段训练，引入高质量推理数据构造策略和任务特定奖励框架。

Result: 在MMDocIR基准测试中达到最优性能，召回率@1提升超过4%。

Conclusion: MM-R5通过推理增强训练管道显著提升了多模态重排任务的效果和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text,
images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question
answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers
improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However,
current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant
room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness.
Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and
optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal
Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval,
aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal
reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving
instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and
high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data
construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the
RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking
reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward
to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5
achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable
results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the
best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results
validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

### [342] [ConsistencyChecker: Tree-based Evaluation of LLM Generalization Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12376)
*Zhaochen Hong,Haofei Yu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ConsistencyChecker是一个基于树的评估框架，用于衡量大语言模型在多步交互中的一致性，通过可逆变换序列实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自一致性方法难以捕捉自然语言中的语义变化和代码/方程的功能变化，这些变化在多步转换中可能累积。

Method: 提出ConsistencyChecker框架，节点表示文本状态，边对应逆操作对，通过动态和LLM生成的基准评估模型。

Result: 在八个不同模型上实验，ConsistencyChecker能区分模型性能，其一致性分数与WMT 2024自动排名强相关（r > 0.7）。

Conclusion: ConsistencyChecker提供了一种无需基准的有效方法，验证了其在评估大语言模型一致性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Evaluating consistency in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
ensuring reliability, particularly in complex, multi-step interactions between
humans and LLMs. Traditional self-consistency methods often miss subtle
semantic changes in natural language and functional shifts in code or
equations, which can accumulate over multiple transformations. To address this,
we propose ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework designed to
measure consistency through sequences of reversible transformations, including
machine translation tasks and AI-assisted programming tasks. In our framework,
nodes represent distinct text states, while edges correspond to pairs of
inverse operations. Dynamic and LLM-generated benchmarks ensure a fair
assessment of the model's generalization ability and eliminate benchmark
leakage. Consistency is quantified based on similarity across different depths
of the transformation tree. Experiments on eight models from various families
and sizes show that ConsistencyChecker can distinguish the performance of
different models. Notably, our consistency scores-computed entirely without
using WMT paired data-correlate strongly (r > 0.7) with WMT 2024 auto-ranking,
demonstrating the validity of our benchmark-free approach. Our implementation
is available at: https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/consistencychecker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在连续编辑场景中表现不佳且损害模型通用能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先通过监督微调（R-SFT）内化新知识，再通过模型合并保留新知识与原模型能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在连续编辑中显著优于现有方法，同时更好地保留了模型原有性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需架构修改即可有效更新知识并保持模型通用能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate
and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing
approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle
with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the
model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This
paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning
(R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes
the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model
with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and
general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better
preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any
architectural changes. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长程思考和复杂约束下表现不佳，导致旅行规划不理想。

Method: 提出MAoP方法，通过多角度预规划生成蓝图，提升LLM的推理能力。

Result: MAoP显著提高了复杂规划任务的性能，Travel-Sim基准测试验证了动态场景的可行性。

Conclusion: MAoP和Travel-Sim为LLM在复杂规划和动态场景评估中提供了新思路。

Abstract: Travel planning is a complex task requiring the integration of diverse
real-world information and user preferences. While LLMs show promise, existing
methods with long-horizon thinking struggle with handling multifaceted
constraints and preferences in the context, leading to suboptimal itineraries.
We formulate this as an $L^3$ planning problem, emphasizing long context, long
instruction, and long output. To tackle this, we introduce Multiple Aspects of
Planning (MAoP), enabling LLMs to conduct wide-horizon thinking to solve
complex planning problems. Instead of direct planning, MAoP leverages the
strategist to conduct pre-planning from various aspects and provide the
planning blueprint for planning models, enabling strong inference-time
scalability for better performance. In addition, current benchmarks overlook
travel's dynamic nature, where past events impact subsequent journeys, failing
to reflect real-world feasibility. To address this, we propose Travel-Sim, an
agent-based benchmark assessing plans via real-world travel simulation. This
work advances LLM capabilities in complex planning and offers novel insights
for evaluating sophisticated scenarios through agent-based simulation.

Result: AI Flow提供了增强的智能、及时响应和无处不在的AI服务访问能力。

Conclusion: AI Flow为AI技术与通信系统的更紧密融合铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多信息适配器（MALM），通过多图学习方法缓解大语言模型（LLM）中的三种幻觉问题，实验证明其有效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）易产生输入冲突、上下文冲突和事实冲突三种幻觉，研究旨在通过利用它们之间的相互依赖性来缓解这些问题。

Method: 提出MALM框架，采用多图学习方法分析输入、上下文和外部事实知识之间的关系，并在四种基准数据集上进行实验。

Result: MALM在7种典型LLM上表现优于LLaMA-2，且在检索增强生成（RAG）中泛化能力强。GPT-4和人类评价分别偏好MALM的79.4%和65.6%的回答。

Conclusion: 通过多层图注意力网络整合三种幻觉的复杂交互，能有效缓解幻觉问题，MALM设计灵活且适用于不同基础LLM。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to three types of hallucination:
Input-Conflicting, Context-Conflicting and Fact-Conflicting hallucinations. The
purpose of this study is to mitigate the different types of hallucination by
exploiting the interdependence between them. For this purpose, we propose a
Multi-Information Adapter for Large Language Models (MALM). This framework
employs a tailored multi-graph learning approach designed to elucidate the
interconnections between original inputs, contextual information, and external
factual knowledge, thereby alleviating the three categories of hallucination
within a cohesive framework. Experiments were carried out on four benchmarking
datasets: HaluEval, TruthfulQA, Natural Questions, and TriviaQA. We evaluated
the proposed framework in two aspects: (1) adaptability to different base LLMs
on HaluEval and TruthfulQA, to confirm if MALM is effective when applied on 7
typical LLMs. MALM showed significant improvements over LLaMA-2; (2)
generalizability to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by combining MALM with
three representative retrievers (BM25, Spider and DPR) separately. Furthermore,
automated and human evaluations were conducted to substantiate the correctness
of experimental results, where GPT-4 and 3 human volunteers judged which
response was better between LLaMA-2 and MALM. The results showed that both
GPT-4 and human preferred MALM in 79.4% and 65.6% of cases respectively. The
results validate that incorporating the complex interactions between the three
types of hallucination through a multilayered graph attention network into the
LLM generation process is effective to mitigate the them. The adapter design of
the proposed approach is also proven flexible and robust across different base
LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法通常对所有查询均匀分配计算资源，忽略了查询难度的差异，导致效率低下。

Method: 将测试时计算资源分配问题建模为一种新颖的强盗学习问题，并提出自适应算法动态估计查询难度并分配计算资源。

Result: 相比均匀分配，算法在保持简单查询准确率的同时，为困难查询分配更多计算资源，并在可解查询上优先分配资源。实验显示在MATH-500和LiveCodeBench上性能分别提升11.10%和7.41%。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实验上均优于均匀分配策略，显著提高了计算效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as an effective strategy for improving
the performance of large language models. However, existing methods typically
allocate compute uniformly across all queries, overlooking variation in query
difficulty. To address this inefficiency, we formulate test-time compute
allocation as a novel bandit learning problem and propose adaptive algorithms
that estimate query difficulty on the fly and allocate compute accordingly.
Compared to uniform allocation, our algorithms allocate more compute to
challenging queries while maintaining accuracy on easier ones. Among
challenging queries, our algorithms further learn to prioritize solvable
instances, effectively reducing excessive computing on unsolvable queries. We
theoretically prove that our algorithms achieve better compute efficiency than
uniform allocation and empirically validate their effectiveness on math and
code benchmarks. Specifically, our algorithms achieve up to an 11.10%
performance improvement (15.04% relative) on the MATH-500 dataset and up to a
7.41% performance improvement (14.40% relative) on LiveCodeBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO框架因被拒绝回答对损失函数的过度影响，导致优化效果不佳，无法有效提升首选回答的生成概率。

Method: 提出Bounded-DPO (BDPO)，限制被拒绝回答的影响，同时保留DPO的优化结构。

Result: BDPO在理论和实证评估中表现优于现有算法，实现了选择和拒绝回答的平衡优化。

Conclusion: BDPO解决了DPO的局限性，提供了一种更有效的优化方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a simple and efficient framework that
has attracted substantial attention. However, it often struggles to meet its
primary objectives -- increasing the generation probability of chosen responses
while reducing that of rejected responses -- due to the dominant influence of
rejected responses on the loss function. This imbalance leads to suboptimal
performance in promoting preferred responses. In this work, we systematically
analyze the limitations of DPO and existing algorithms designed to achieve the
objectives stated above. To address these limitations, we propose Bounded-DPO
(BDPO), a novel method that bounds the influence of rejected responses while
maintaining the original optimization structure of DPO. Through theoretical
analysis and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that BDPO achieves a
balanced optimization of the chosen and rejected responses, outperforming
existing algorithms.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, increasing attention has been
given to their social interaction and strategic reasoning capabilities.
However, existing Werewolf-based benchmarking platforms suffer from overly
simplified game settings, incomplete evaluation metrics, and poor scalability.
To address these limitations, we propose WereWolf-Plus, a multi-model,
multi-dimensional, and multi-method benchmarking platform for evaluating
multi-agent strategic reasoning in the Werewolf game. The platform offers
strong extensibility, supporting customizable configurations for roles such as
Seer, Witch, Hunter, Guard, and Sheriff, along with flexible model assignment
and reasoning enhancement strategies for different roles. In addition, we
introduce a comprehensive set of quantitative evaluation metrics for all
special roles, werewolves, and the sheriff, and enrich the assessment
dimensions for agent reasoning ability, cooperation capacity, and social
influence. WereWolf-Plus provides a more flexible and reliable environment for
advancing research on inference and strategic interaction within multi-agent
communities. Our code is open sourced at

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂认知建模提供了机制化和可解释的方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a formal framework for quantifying the internal
dependencies between functional subsystems within artificial agents whose
belief states are composed of structured linguistic fragments. Building on the
Semantic Manifold framework, which organizes belief content into functional
sectors and stratifies them across hierarchical levels of abstraction, we
introduce a system of sectoral coupling constants that characterize how one
cognitive sector influences another within a fixed level of abstraction. The
complete set of these constants forms an agent-specific coupling profile that
governs internal information flow, shaping the agent's overall processing
tendencies and cognitive style. We provide a detailed taxonomy of these
intra-level coupling roles, covering domains such as perceptual integration,
memory access and formation, planning, meta-cognition, execution control, and
affective modulation. We also explore how these coupling profiles generate
feedback loops, systemic dynamics, and emergent signatures of cognitive
behavior. Methodologies for inferring these profiles from behavioral or
internal agent data are outlined, along with a discussion of how these
couplings evolve across abstraction levels. This framework contributes a
mechanistic and interpretable approach to modeling complex cognition, with
applications in AI system design, alignment diagnostics, and the analysis of
emergent agent behavior.

Abstract: Large Language models have demonstrated promising performance in research
ideation across scientific domains. Hypothesis development, the process of
generating a highly specific declarative statement connecting a research idea
with empirical validation, has received relatively less attention. Existing
approaches trivially deploy retrieval augmentation and focus only on the
quality of the final output ignoring the underlying reasoning process behind
ideation. We present $\texttt{HypER}$ ($\textbf{Hyp}$othesis Generation with
$\textbf{E}$xplanation and $\textbf{R}$easoning), a small language model (SLM)
trained for literature-guided reasoning and evidence-based hypothesis
generation. $\texttt{HypER}$ is trained in a multi-task setting to discriminate
between valid and invalid scientific reasoning chains in presence of controlled
distractions. We find that $\texttt{HypER}$ outperformes the base model,
distinguishing valid from invalid reasoning chains (+22\% average absolute F1),
generates better evidence-grounded hypotheses (0.327 vs. 0.305 base model) with
high feasibility and impact as judged by human experts ($>$3.5 on 5-point
Likert scale).

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address factual inconsistencies
in Large Language Models by grounding generation in external knowledge, yet
they face a fundamental efficiency problem: simple queries consume
computational resources equivalent to complex multi-hop reasoning tasks. We
present SymRAG, a neuro-symbolic framework that introduces adaptive query
routing based on real-time complexity and system load assessments. SymRAG
dynamically selects symbolic, neural, or hybrid processing paths to align
resource use with query demands. Evaluated on 2,000 queries from HotpotQA and
DROP using Llama-3.2-3B and Mistral-7B models, SymRAG achieves 97.6--100.0%
exact match accuracy with significantly lower CPU utilization (3.6--6.2%) and
processing time (0.985--3.165s). Disabling adaptive logic results in 169--1151%
increase in processing time, highlighting the framework's impact. These results
underscore the potential of adaptive neuro-symbolic routing for scalable,

TL;DR: ARKNESS框架结合知识图谱与检索增强生成，为CNC加工提供可验证的精确答案，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的CNC工艺规划方法在处理新拓扑、新材料或动态约束时受限，LLMs虽灵活但数值不可靠。

Method: ARKNESS通过零样本知识图谱构建与检索增强生成，自动从异构数据中提取知识并注入LLMs。

Result: 在155个行业问题上，ARKNESS增强的轻量级Llama-3模型性能优于GPT-4o，多项指标显著提升。

Conclusion: ARKNESS为CNC工艺规划提供了一种高效、可验证的解决方案，弥补了传统方法与LLMs的不足。

Abstract: Precision process planning in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining
demands rapid, context-aware decisions on tool selection, feed-speed pairs, and
multi-axis routing, placing immense cognitive and procedural burdens on
engineers from design specification through final part inspection. Conventional
rule-based computer-aided process planning and knowledge-engineering shells
freeze domain know-how into static tables, which become limited when dealing
with unseen topologies, novel material states, shifting
cost-quality-sustainability weightings, or shop-floor constraints such as tool
unavailability and energy caps. Large language models (LLMs) promise flexible,
instruction-driven reasoning for tasks but they routinely hallucinate numeric
values and provide no provenance. We present Augmented Retrieval Knowledge
Network Enhanced Search & Synthesis (ARKNESS), the end-to-end framework that
fuses zero-shot Knowledge Graph (KG) construction with retrieval-augmented
generation to deliver verifiable, numerically exact answers for CNC process
planning. ARKNESS (1) automatically distills heterogeneous machining documents,
G-code annotations, and vendor datasheets into augmented triple,
multi-relational graphs without manual labeling, and (2) couples any on-prem
LLM with a retriever that injects the minimal, evidence-linked subgraph needed
to answer a query. Benchmarked on 155 industry-curated questions spanning tool
sizing and feed-speed optimization, a lightweight 3B-parameter Llama-3
augmented by ARKNESS matches GPT-4o accuracy while achieving a +25 percentage
point gain in multiple-choice accuracy, +22.4 pp in F1, and 8.1x ROUGE-L on

Abstract: Fact verification is essential for ensuring the reliability of LLM
applications. In this study, we evaluate 12 pre-trained LLMs and one
specialized fact-verifier, including frontier LLMs and open-weight reasoning
LLMs, using a collection of examples from 14 fact-checking benchmarks. We share
three findings intended to guide future development of more robust fact
verifiers. First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors
and ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\% of ambiguous
or incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting
this issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,
and we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help
identify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with
few-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve
top-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons
with these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their
effectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the
development of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small
models still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require
complex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with
synthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in
such instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Stream-Omni是一种高效的多模态对齐模型，通过关系驱动的模态整合方法，减少了对大规模数据的依赖，并在视觉、语音交互任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）通常通过序列维度拼接模态表示，依赖大量数据学习对齐。本文旨在更高效、灵活地建模模态关系。

Method: Stream-Omni以LLM为骨干，根据模态关系对齐视觉和语音：视觉通过序列维度拼接对齐文本，语音通过CTC层维度映射对齐文本。

Result: 实验表明，Stream-Omni在视觉理解、语音交互等任务中表现优异，且能提供中间文本输出（如ASR转录）。

Conclusion: Stream-Omni通过关系驱动的对齐方法，实现了高效的多模态整合，减少了数据需求，提升了交互体验。

Abstract: The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the
exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more
flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate
representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a
large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is
straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on
large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model
the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more
efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose
Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality
alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various
modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the
vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is
semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension
concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically
consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension
mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve
modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer
of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual
understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction
tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously
provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model
responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal
experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Metis-RISE提出了一种新的多模态推理模型学习方法，通过先RL后SFT的策略，激活模型潜在推理能力并解决RL阶段的挑战，最终在OpenCompass评测中取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（纯RL或先SFT后RL）在样本效率、推理能力激活和收敛性方面存在不足，需改进。

Method: Metis-RISE跳过初始SFT阶段，先通过RL激活模型推理能力，再通过SFT解决RL阶段发现的低效轨迹采样和基础能力缺失问题。

Result: 7B和72B参数模型在OpenCompass评测中表现优异，72B版本排名第四。

Conclusion: Metis-RISE通过RL激励和SFT增强的策略，在多模态推理任务中实现了先进性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in
the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated
into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches
often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can
struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning
capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's
exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we
introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and
\textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike
conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage,
beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy
Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning
capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges
identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks
where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which
we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself;
and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting
expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This
strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement
forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B
parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard
demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among
similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法，通过提取服装不变表示和引入循环合成框架，解决了宽松服装虚拟试穿中的语义图估计不稳定和帧间抖动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人体语义图对齐服装，但在宽松服装下语义图不可靠，且缺乏时间信息导致抖动。

Method: 两阶段方法：提取服装不变表示并通过辅助网络估计语义图；引入循环合成框架利用时间依赖提升帧间一致性。

Result: 在图像质量和时间一致性上优于现有方法，消融实验验证了服装不变表示和循环框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 方法显著提升了宽松服装虚拟试穿的鲁棒性和视觉效果。

Abstract: Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and
train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However,
these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key
limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with
the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by
loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment
synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information,
leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we
extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This
representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the
semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under
loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore,
we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal
dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time
performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image
quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the
effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent
synthesis framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为iDiT-HOI的新框架，用于生成野外手-物交互（HOI）视频，通过两阶段视频扩散变换器（DiT）模型和统一的基于修复的标记处理方法（Inp-TPU），解决了现有技术在手-物交互中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数字人视频生成在教育和电子商务等领域越来越受欢迎，但真实的手-物交互（HOI）仍然面临诸多挑战，如遮挡、物体形状和方向的变化，以及对未见过的物体和场景的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段视频扩散变换器（DiT）模型，结合Inp-TPU方法。第一阶段生成关键帧，将指定物体插入手部区域；第二阶段确保手-物交互的时间一致性和流畅性。

Conclusion: iDiT-HOI框架通过复用预训练模型的上下文感知能力，无需额外参数，实现了对未见物体和场景的强泛化能力，并支持长视频生成。

Abstract: Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education
and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing
technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex
dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges.
Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues
such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and
orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and
importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper
presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment
generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process
method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT)
model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object
into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second
stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The
key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context
perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling
strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed
paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in
challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless
hand-object interactions.

Conclusion: NeuVAS通过变分方法和曲率平滑项，成功解决了稀疏几何控制下的神经隐式表面建模问题。

Abstract: Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in
recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological
flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface,
especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF),
with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape
control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve
sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve
network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or
curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied
topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve
constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape
modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape
control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve
networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of
surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of
a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp
feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive
comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant
advantages of our method.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在高反射场景中表现出色，并通过GPU加速实现了高效渲染。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated remarkable novel view synthesis
performance at high rendering frame rates. Optimization-based inverse rendering
within complex capture scenarios remains however a challenging problem. A
particular case is modelling complex surface light interactions for highly
reflective scenes, which results in intricate high frequency specular radiance
components. We hypothesize that such challenging settings can benefit from
increased representation power. We hence propose a method that tackles this
issue through a geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting borne
radiance field, where normals and material properties are spatially variable in
the primitive's local space. Using per-primitive texture maps for this purpose,
we also propose to harness the GPU hardware to accelerate rendering at test
time via unified material texture atlas.

Result: 系统能够生成一致且逼真的超高分辨率图像，支持无缝缩放。

Conclusion: UltraZoom通过创新的配对数据集构建和模型调整，实现了从简单输入生成高质量超高分辨率图像的目标。

Abstract: We present UltraZoom, a system for generating gigapixel-resolution images of
objects from casually captured inputs, such as handheld phone photos. Given a
full-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local,
high-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and
scale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance
paired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to
learn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply
the model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these
pairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full
image for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple,
robust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual,
in-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables
seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent,
photorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂语音场景中表现出色，显著提升了罕见词识别和重叠语音处理能力。

Abstract: In real-world applications, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems must
handle overlapping speech from multiple speakers and recognize rare words like
technical terms. Traditional methods address multi-talker ASR and contextual
biasing separately, limiting performance in complex scenarios. We propose a
unified framework that combines multi-talker overlapping speech recognition and
contextual biasing into a single task. Our ASR method integrates pretrained
speech encoders and large language models (LLMs), using optimized finetuning
strategies. We also introduce a two-stage filtering algorithm to efficiently
identify relevant rare words from large biasing lists and incorporate them into
the LLM's prompt input, enhancing rare word recognition. Experiments show that
our approach outperforms traditional contextual biasing methods, achieving a

Abstract: Accurate alignment of dysfluent speech with intended text is crucial for

by leveraging robust phoneme-level modeling. We evaluate our method on a

Motivation: 当前AI生成的虚拟形象在动态情感表达上存在不足，限制了其在敏感场景（如儿童虐待调查培训）中的应用。

Method: 采用分布式双PC架构，分离语言处理和GPU密集型渲染，支持低延迟交互。通过实验评估音频+视觉和纯视觉条件下情绪识别的效果。

Result: 悲伤和快乐情绪识别率高，但愤怒情绪识别显著依赖音频。去除音频反而提升了面部真实感。

Conclusion: 技术可行，但需解决视听同步问题，以优化敏感培训模拟中的非语言交流。

Abstract: Dynamic facial emotion is essential for believable AI-generated avatars;
however, most systems remain visually inert, limiting their utility in
high-stakes simulations such as virtual training for investigative interviews
with abused children. We introduce and evaluate a real-time architecture fusing
Unreal Engine 5 MetaHuman rendering with NVIDIA Omniverse Audio2Face to
translate vocal prosody into high-fidelity facial expressions on photorealistic
child avatars. We implemented a distributed two-PC setup that decouples
language processing and speech synthesis from GPU-intensive rendering, designed
to support low-latency interaction in desktop and VR environments. A
between-subjects study ($N=70$) using audio+visual and visual-only conditions
assessed perceptual impacts as participants rated emotional clarity, facial
realism, and empathy for two avatars expressing joy, sadness, and anger.
  Results demonstrate that avatars could express emotions recognizably, with
sadness and joy achieving high identification rates. However, anger recognition
significantly dropped without audio, highlighting the importance of congruent
vocal cues for high-arousal emotions. Interestingly, removing audio boosted
perceived facial realism, suggesting that audiovisual desynchrony remains a key
design challenge. These findings confirm the technical feasibility of
generating emotionally expressive avatars and provide guidance for improving
non-verbal communication in sensitive training simulations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨合成数据在医学影像分割任务中替代真实数据的潜力，发现其在MRI中表现较好，但在CT中效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学数据保护严格，合成数据可能是解决方案，但需评估其真实性和实用性。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络和扩散模型生成合成数据，并通过MAE、MS-SSIM、Radiomics、视觉图灵测试（VTT）和DSC评估其质量和实用性。

Result: 合成MRI数据质量较高（相关系数0.8784），但CT数据较差（0.5461）。分割任务中，MRI表现较好（DSC=0.834），CT较差（DSC=0.064）。

Conclusion: 合成数据可用于分割任务，但受限于结构复杂性。需改进生成模型以提升真实性和应用潜力。

Abstract: AI requires extensive datasets, while medical data is subject to high data
protection. Anonymization is essential, but poses a challenge for some regions,
such as the head, as identifying structures overlap with regions of clinical
interest. Synthetic data offers a potential solution, but studies often lack
rigorous evaluation of realism and utility. Therefore, we investigate to what
extent synthetic data can replace real data in segmentation tasks. We employed
head and neck cancer CT scans and brain glioma MRI scans from two large
datasets. Synthetic data were generated using generative adversarial networks
and diffusion models. We evaluated the quality of the synthetic data using MAE,
MS-SSIM, Radiomics and a Visual Turing Test (VTT) performed by 5 radiologists
and their usefulness in segmentation tasks using DSC. Radiomics indicates high
fidelity of synthetic MRIs, but fall short in producing highly realistic CT
tissue, with correlation coefficient of 0.8784 and 0.5461 for MRI and CT
tumors, respectively. DSC results indicate limited utility of synthetic data:
tumor segmentation achieved DSC=0.064 on CT and 0.834 on MRI, while bone
segmentation a mean DSC=0.841. Relation between DSC and correlation is
observed, but is limited by the complexity of the task. VTT results show
synthetic CTs' utility, but with limited educational applications. Synthetic
data can be used independently for the segmentation task, although limited by
the complexity of the structures to segment. Advancing generative models to
better tolerate heterogeneous inputs and learn subtle details is essential for
enhancing their realism and expanding their application potential.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MRI-CORE是一个预训练的视觉基础模型，旨在解决MRI任务中标注数据稀缺的问题，通过大规模数据预训练显著提升小样本任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI任务中标注数据获取成本高且隐私问题突出，限制了深度学习模型的开发与应用。

Method: 提出MRI-CORE模型，利用超过6百万张MRI切片预训练，覆盖18个主要身体部位。

Result: 在五个分割任务中，仅用10张标注切片即可平均提升6.97%的3D Dice系数，并展示了零样本分割等新能力。

Conclusion: MRI-CORE作为通用MRI视觉基础模型，有望降低数据标注资源门槛，推动更多应用。

Abstract: The widespread use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the rise of deep
learning have enabled the development of powerful predictive models for a wide
range of diagnostic tasks in MRI, such as image classification or object
segmentation. However, training models for specific new tasks often requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high
annotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we
introduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision
foundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000
MRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object
segmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve
segmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data
availability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only
10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in
MRI such as classification of image properties including body location,
sequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results
highlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for
MRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many
applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视频超分辨率（VSR）在会议场景中的应用，重点研究了低延迟条件下的因果模型，并开源了一个新的屏幕内容数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率在会议场景中具有重要应用价值，尤其是在低延迟条件下提升视频质量的需求日益增长。

Method: 研究采用了局部、单向、双向传播以及传统上采样结合恢复的方法，并设计了三个赛道（通用视频、头部视频、屏幕内容视频）进行验证。

Result: 通过主观测试（ITU-T Rec P.910）评估了提交方案，并开源了一个新的屏幕内容数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究为视频超分辨率在会议场景中的低延迟应用提供了有效方法，并贡献了一个新的数据集。

Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on
reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The
field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in
single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal
domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-,
bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration.
This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with
H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor,
providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay
scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks:
general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with
separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and
testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this
challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a
crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.

### [368] [Shape-aware Sampling Matters in the Modeling of Multi-Class Tubular Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12395)
*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Yun Gu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Shapeaware Sampling (SAS)的方法，通过优化采样策略和拓扑保留的骨架表示，提升了多类别管状结构建模的精度和拓扑完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在管状结构建模中过于关注体积重叠精度，而忽略了细粒度语义形状的复杂性和拓扑结构的保留。

Method: SAS结合了Fractal Dimension-based Patchsize (FDPS)量化形状复杂度，并采用Minimum Path-Cost Skeletonization (MPC-Skel)生成拓扑一致的骨架表示。

Result: 在两个语义管状数据集上的实验表明，SAS在体积重叠和拓扑完整性指标上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: SAS是一种高效且易于集成的方法，能够有效解决管状结构建模中的拓扑保留问题。

Abstract: Accurate multi-class tubular modeling is critical for precise lesion
localization and optimal treatment planning. Deep learning methods enable
automated shape modeling by prioritizing volumetric overlap accuracy. However,
the inherent complexity of fine-grained semantic tubular shapes is not fully
emphasized by overlap accuracy, resulting in reduced topological preservation.
To address this, we propose the Shapeaware Sampling (SAS), which optimizes
patchsize allocation for online sampling and extracts a topology-preserved
skeletal representation for the objective function. Fractal Dimension-based
Patchsize (FDPS) is first introduced to quantify semantic tubular shape
complexity through axis-specific fractal dimension analysis. Axes with higher
fractal complexity are then sampled with smaller patchsizes to capture
fine-grained features and resolve structural intricacies. In addition, Minimum
Path-Cost Skeletonization (MPC-Skel) is employed to sample topologically
consistent skeletal representations of semantic tubular shapes for
skeleton-weighted objective functions. MPC-Skel reduces artifacts from
conventional skeletonization methods and directs the focus to critical
topological regions, enhancing tubular topology preservation. SAS is
computationally efficient and easily integrable into optimization pipelines.
Evaluation on two semantic tubular datasets showed consistent improvements in
both volumetric overlap and topological integrity metrics.

### [369] [Adaptive Multi-resolution Hash-Encoding Framework for INR-based Dental CBCT Reconstruction with Truncated FOV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12471)
*Hyoung Suk Park,Kiwan Jeon*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）和哈希编码的高效3D牙科CBCT重建框架，通过扩展重建域和自适应训练策略减少截断伪影，同时显著降低计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用INR技术到3D牙科CBCT时，截断视野（FOV）会导致投影数据与重建域不匹配，产生严重伪影。

Method: 采用多分辨率哈希编码，扩展重建域以覆盖患者头部，并使用自适应训练策略（精细分辨率在截断FOV内，粗分辨率在外）。

Result: 扩展FOV有效减少伪影，自适应策略比固定分辨率节省60%计算时间，同时保持PSNR。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和重建质量上均优于传统方法，适用于截断FOV的牙科CBCT重建。

Abstract: Implicit neural representation (INR), particularly in combination with hash
encoding, has recently emerged as a promising approach for computed tomography
(CT) image reconstruction. However, directly applying INR techniques to 3D
dental cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a truncated field of view (FOV) is challenging.
During the training process, if the FOV does not fully encompass the patient's
head, a discrepancy arises between the measured projections and the forward
projections computed within the truncated domain. This mismatch leads the
network to estimate attenuation values inaccurately, producing severe artifacts
in the reconstructed images. In this study, we propose a computationally
efficient INR-based reconstruction framework that leverages multi-resolution
hash encoding for 3D dental CBCT with a truncated FOV. To mitigate truncation
artifacts, we train the network over an expanded reconstruction domain that
fully encompasses the patient's head. For computational efficiency, we adopt an
adaptive training strategy that uses a multi-resolution grid: finer resolution
levels and denser sampling inside the truncated FOV, and coarser resolution
levels with sparser sampling outside. To maintain consistent input
dimensionality of the network across spatially varying resolutions, we
introduce an adaptive hash encoder that selectively activates the lower-level
features of the hash hierarchy for points outside the truncated FOV. The
proposed method with an extended FOV effectively mitigates truncation
artifacts. Compared with a naive domain extension using fixed resolution levels
and a fixed sampling rate, the adaptive strategy reduces computational time by
over 60% for an image volume of 800x800x600, while preserving the PSNR within
the truncated FOV.

### [370] [Efficient Star Distillation Attention Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12475)
*Fangwei Hao,Ji Du,Desheng Kong,Jiesheng Wu,Jing Xu,Ping Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Star Distillation Module (SDM)和Multi-shape Multi-scale Large Kernel Attention (MM-LKA)，以解决轻量级单图像超分辨率（SISR）中信息蒸馏和高维非线性特征空间映射的局限性，同时降低计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级SISR方法在信息蒸馏和高维非线性特征空间映射方面表现不足，且LKA模块在捕获多尺度长程依赖时计算负担大。

Method: 提出SDM增强高维非线性特征空间的信息蒸馏，设计MM-LKA模块高效捕获多尺度长程依赖，并整合为RSDAM模块，构建高效网络SDAN。

Result: 实验表明，SDAN在模型复杂度低的情况下，定量和视觉上均优于其他轻量级SISR方法。

Conclusion: SDAN通过SDM和MM-LKA的结合，显著提升了轻量级SISR的性能和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, the performance of lightweight Single-Image Super-Resolution
(SISR) has been improved significantly with the application of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and Large Kernel Attention (LKA). However, existing
information distillation modules for lightweight SISR struggle to map inputs
into High-Dimensional Non-Linear (HDNL) feature spaces, limiting their
representation learning. And their LKA modules possess restricted ability to
capture the multi-shape multi-scale information for long-range dependencies
while encountering a quadratic increase in the computational burden with
increasing convolutional kernel size of its depth-wise convolutional layer. To
address these issues, we firstly propose a Star Distillation Module (SDM) to
enhance the discriminative representation learning via information distillation
in the HDNL feature spaces. Besides, we present a Multi-shape Multi-scale Large
Kernel Attention (MM-LKA) module to learn representative long-range
dependencies while incurring low computational and memory footprints, leading
to improving the performance of CNN-based self-attention significantly.
Integrating SDM and MM-LKA, we develop a Residual Star Distillation Attention
Module (RSDAM) and take it as the building block of the proposed efficient Star
Distillation Attention Network (SDAN) which possesses high reconstruction
efficiency to recover a higher-quality image from the corresponding
low-resolution (LR) counterpart. When compared with other lightweight
state-of-the-art SISR methods, extensive experiments show that our SDAN with
low model complexity yields superior performance quantitatively and visually.

*Ali Zafari,Xi Chen,Shirin Jalali*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ZS-NCD是一种基于神经压缩的零样本去噪框架，无需训练样本或干净参考图像，适用于医学成像等专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本去噪问题，特别是在医学成像等专业领域中缺乏训练数据的情况。

Method: 利用神经压缩网络作为未训练模型，直接在单个噪声图像的提取块上进行优化，通过熵约束避免过拟合。

Result: ZS-NCD在零样本去噪中达到最先进性能，适用于高斯和泊松噪声，并泛化到自然和非自然图像。

Conclusion: ZS-NCD为压缩去噪提供了理论基础，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training
samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in
practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical
imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression
Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression.
ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized
directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final
reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model
over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of
compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not
require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments,
we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot
denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both
natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample
theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable
reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers.
These results further establish the theoretical foundations of
compression-based denoising. Our code is available at:

medical imaging, particularly for modality transformation and multimodal fusion
in MRI-based brain imaging. This study introduces GM-LDM, a novel framework
that leverages the latent diffusion model (LDM) to enhance the efficiency and
precision of MRI generation tasks. GM-LDM integrates a 3D autoencoder,
pre-trained on the large-scale ABCD MRI dataset, achieving statistical
consistency through KL divergence loss. We employ a Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based encoder-decoder as the denoising network to optimize generation
quality. The framework flexibly incorporates conditional data, such as
functional network connectivity (FNC) data, enabling personalized brain
imaging, biomarker identification, and functional-to-structural information
translation for brain diseases like schizophrenia.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a robust methodology for identification of myeloid
blasts followed by prediction of genetic mutation in single-cell images of
blasts, tackling challenges associated with label accuracy and data noise. We
trained an initial binary classifier to distinguish between leukemic (blasts)
and non-leukemic cells images, achieving 90 percent accuracy. To evaluate the
models generalization, we applied this model to a separate large unlabeled
dataset and validated the predictions with two haemato-pathologists, finding an
approximate error rate of 20 percent in the leukemic and non-leukemic labels.
Assuming this level of label noise, we further trained a four-class model on
images predicted as blasts to classify specific mutations. The mutation labels
were known for only a bag of cell images extracted from a single slide. Despite
the tumor label noise, our mutation classification model achieved 85 percent
accuracy across four mutation classes, demonstrating resilience to label
inconsistencies. This study highlights the capability of machine learning
models to work with noisy labels effectively while providing accurate,
clinically relevant mutation predictions, which is promising for diagnostic
applications in areas such as haemato-pathology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ViT-NeBLa是一种基于视觉变换器的模型，直接从2D全景X光片实现精确3D重建，解决了现有方法的成本和辐射问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有牙科成像技术（如CBCT）成本高且辐射大，而2D全景X光片缺乏深度信息，ViT-NeBLa旨在提供一种更高效、低成本的3D重建方案。

Method: 结合视觉变换器和NeBLa框架，采用马蹄形点采样策略和混合ViT-CNN架构，优化3D重建过程。

Result: ViT-NeBLa在定量和定性上均优于现有方法，计算量减少52%。

Conclusion: ViT-NeBLa为牙科诊断提供了一种低成本、低辐射的3D重建替代方案。

Abstract: Dental diagnosis relies on two primary imaging modalities: panoramic
radiographs (PX) providing 2D oral cavity representations, and Cone-Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) offering detailed 3D anatomical information. While
PX images are cost-effective and accessible, their lack of depth information
limits diagnostic accuracy. CBCT addresses this but presents drawbacks
including higher costs, increased radiation exposure, and limited
accessibility. Existing reconstruction models further complicate the process by
requiring CBCT flattening or prior dental arch information, often unavailable
clinically. We introduce ViT-NeBLa, a vision transformer-based Neural
Beer-Lambert model enabling accurate 3D reconstruction directly from single PX.
Our key innovations include: (1) enhancing the NeBLa framework with Vision
Transformers for improved reconstruction capabilities without requiring CBCT
flattening or prior dental arch information, (2) implementing a novel
horseshoe-shaped point sampling strategy with non-intersecting rays that
eliminates intermediate density aggregation required by existing models due to
intersecting rays, reducing sampling point computations by $52 \%$, (3)
replacing CNN-based U-Net with a hybrid ViT-CNN architecture for superior
global and local feature extraction, and (4) implementing learnable hash
positional encoding for better higher-dimensional representation of 3D sample
points compared to existing Fourier-based dense positional encoding.
Experiments demonstrate that ViT-NeBLa significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, offering a
cost-effective, radiation-efficient alternative for enhanced dental
diagnostics.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), large neural networks pretrained on extensive and
diverse datasets, have revolutionized artificial intelligence and shown
significant promise in medical imaging by enabling robust performance with
limited labeled data. Although numerous surveys have reviewed the application
of FM in healthcare care, brain imaging remains underrepresented, despite its
critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases using
modalities such as MRI, CT, and PET. Existing reviews either marginalize brain
imaging or lack depth on the unique challenges and requirements of FM in this
domain, such as multimodal data integration, support for diverse clinical
tasks, and handling of heterogeneous, fragmented datasets.
  To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive and curated review of
FMs for brain imaging. We systematically analyze 161 brain imaging datasets and
86 FM architectures, providing information on key design choices, training
paradigms, and optimizations driving recent advances. Our review highlights the
leading models for various brain imaging tasks, summarizes their innovations,
and critically examines current limitations and blind spots in the literature.
We conclude by outlining future research directions to advance FM applications
in brain imaging, with the aim of fostering progress in both clinical and
research settings.

Abstract: While modern segmentation models often prioritize performance over
practicality, we advocate a design philosophy prioritizing simplicity and

Conclusion: PRO展示了投影域合成在数据增强和CT成像中的潜力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Synthesizing high quality CT images remains a signifi-cant challenge due to
the limited availability of annotat-ed data and the complex nature of CT
imaging. In this work, we present PRO, a novel framework that, to the best of
our knowledge, is the first to perform CT image synthesis in the projection
domain using latent diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches that operate
in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representa-tions from raw
projection data and leverages anatomi-cal text prompts for controllable
synthesis. This projec-tion domain strategy enables more faithful modeling of
underlying imaging physics and anatomical structures. Moreover, PRO functions
as a foundation model, capa-ble of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks
by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results
demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves
perfor-mance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and
sparse-view reconstruction, even with limited training data. These findings
underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for
various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection
domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT
imaging. Our source code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging integrates diverse data types, such as structural
and functional neuroimaging, to provide complementary insights that enhance
deep learning predictions and improve outcomes. This study focuses on a
neuroimaging prediction framework based on both structural and functional
neuroimaging data. We propose a next-generation prediction model,
\textbf{MultiViT2}, which combines a pretrained representative learning base
model with a vision transformer backbone for prediction output. Additionally,
we developed a data augmentation module based on the latent diffusion model
that enriches input data by generating augmented neuroimaging samples, thereby
enhancing predictive performance through reduced overfitting and improved
generalizability. We show that MultiViT2 significantly outperforms the
first-generation model in schizophrenia classification accuracy and
demonstrates strong scalability and portability.

### [380] [Exploiting the Exact Denoising Posterior Score in Training-Free Guidance of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13614)
*Gregory Bellchambers*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法，通过精确计算后验得分函数来优化扩散模型的条件采样，适用于图像去噪等任务，并在其他逆问题中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件采样中表现优异，但现有方法（如DPS）难以直接逼近后验得分函数，因此需要一种更精确且高效的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的后验得分函数表达式，利用无条件得分函数计算时间依赖性误差，并动态调整步长以最小化误差。

Result: 该方法在去噪任务中表现优异，并可推广至着色、随机修复和超分辨率等逆问题，采样效率高于DPS。

Conclusion: 尽管方法简单，但在性能上媲美现有最优技术，且能以更少的时间步完成采样。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has driven interest in performing conditional
sampling via training-free guidance of the denoising process to solve image
restoration and other inverse problems. A popular class of methods, based on
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable
posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression
for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in
terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze
the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step
sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that
these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as
colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity,
this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables
sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.

### [381] [Artificial Intelligence and Civil Discourse: How LLMs Moderate Climate Change Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12077)
*Wenlu Fan,Wentao Xu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过其独特的沟通行为自然调节气候变化的讨论，发现LLMs在情感中立和低情绪强度方面具有稳定对话的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在在线平台和数字通信中的广泛应用，其对公共话语（尤其是气候变化等争议话题）的影响需要系统研究。

Method: 比较分析了LLMs与人类用户在社交媒体上的对话，使用了五种先进模型（三个开源和两个商业系统），并通过情感分析评估情绪特征。

Result: LLMs表现出情感中立和较低的情绪强度，能够稳定对话，显示出潜在的调节能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具有改善争议话题公共话语质量的潜力，为AI辅助通信工具的设计提供了参考。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into online
platforms and digital communication spaces, their potential to influence public
discourse - particularly in contentious areas like climate change - requires
systematic investigation. This study examines how LLMs naturally moderate
climate change conversations through their distinct communicative behaviors. We
conduct a comparative analysis of conversations between LLMs and human users on
social media platforms, using five advanced models: three open-source LLMs
(Gemma, Llama 3, and Llama 3.3) and two commercial systems (GPT-4o by OpenAI
and Claude 3.5 by Anthropic). Through sentiment analysis, we assess the
emotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results
reveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs
consistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment
than human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across
contexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings
suggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the
quality of public discourse on controversial topics. This research enhances our
understanding of how AI might support more civil and constructive climate
change discussions and informs the design of AI-assisted communication tools.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究分析了中国开源大模型DeepSeek的信息抑制机制，发现其内部推理中常包含敏感内容，但在最终输出中被省略或改写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型中的信息抑制和审查实践，以确保透明度和公正性。

Method: 提出审计框架，分析模型对646个政治敏感提示的响应，比较最终输出与中间推理。

Result: 发现DeepSeek在语义层面抑制信息，如透明度、政府问责和公民动员，同时放大国家宣传内容。

Conclusion: 需系统审计AI模型的对齐和审查实践，以确保透明和公正的信息获取。

Abstract: This study examines information suppression mechanisms in DeepSeek, an
open-source large language model (LLM) developed in China. We propose an
auditing framework and use it to analyze the model's responses to 646
politically sensitive prompts by comparing its final output with intermediate
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Our audit unveils evidence of semantic-level
information suppression in DeepSeek: sensitive content often appears within the
model's internal reasoning but is omitted or rephrased in the final output.
Specifically, DeepSeek suppresses references to transparency, government
accountability, and civic mobilization, while occasionally amplifying language
aligned with state propaganda. This study underscores the need for systematic
auditing of alignment, content moderation, information suppression, and
censorship practices implemented into widely-adopted AI models, to ensure
transparency, accountability, and equitable access to unbiased information
obtained by means of these systems.
