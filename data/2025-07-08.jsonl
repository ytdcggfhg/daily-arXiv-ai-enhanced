To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network\ndesigned to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections.\nLeveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts\ntime-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations.\nThis integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate\nmodules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV)\nconversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error\npropagation.

However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a\ncandidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and\nuniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,\nand the most promising one is selected for continued exploration."}

Through comparative visual analysis, including Google image results\nand classical paintings, the research evaluates the stylistic, theological, and\ncultural dimensions of AI-generated depictions. Findings show that while AI\nexcels in producing aesthetically rich and imaginative visuals, it also\nreflects the biases and limitations of its training data. The study highlights\nAI's potential to augment human imagination but questions its capacity for\ngenuine creativity, authorial intent, and theological depth.

In this\nwork, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing\nobservation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their\nattention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without\nexplicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests\nthat MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed\nto guide MLLMs to ``look back\" at visual information in a self-directed manner\nduring reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,\nwhere, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit\nmodel-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back\nsignificantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as\nevidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer\npromising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit\ntheir adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI\nadoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility\nfor resource-constrained environments."}

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin.

In this paper, we present Clinical\nPrior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that\nreimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while\npreserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture\nprogressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and\nconditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three\ndomain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary\nambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.\nFurthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to\nimprove its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations\non ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed\nCPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art\napproaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative\nparadigms for surgical phase recognition."}

In contrast, radar sensors, which are\nalready installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they\ndirectly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate\ninstantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point\nclouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance\nscene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify\nmoving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform\nsingle-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The\nkey to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity\ninformation throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise\nsegmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a\ntransformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively\ncombining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse\npoint clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation\nbenchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other\nstate-of-the-art methods. Our network runs faster than the frame rate of the\nsensor and shows superior segmentation results using only single-scan radar\ndata."}

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at\nelevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,\nsupplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D\nobject-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift\nintroduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a\n2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure\nroadside-mounted cameras.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that\ntokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater\nimportance.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned\nvisible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nstate-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal."}

To achieve this\nintegration, PresentAgent employs a modular pipeline that systematically\nsegments the input document, plans and renders slide-style visual frames,\ngenerates contextual spoken narration with large language models and\nText-to-Speech models, and seamlessly composes the final video with precise\naudio-visual alignment. Given the complexity of evaluating such multimodal\noutputs, we introduce PresentEval, a unified assessment framework powered by\nVision-Language Models that comprehensively scores videos across three critical\ndimensions: content fidelity, visual clarity, and audience comprehension\nthrough prompt-based evaluation. Our experimental validation on a curated\ndataset of 30 document-presentation pairs demonstrates that PresentAgent\napproaches human-level quality across all evaluation metrics.

While existing methods often rely on centralized\nfine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time\nadaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This\nlimitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized\nuser-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the\ngeneration quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we\npresent CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time\npersonalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in\nleveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic\noutputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.\nSpecifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning\nproblem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits\nwithin the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by\ntransmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate\nvectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without\nfine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized\ngeneration tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in\ngenerating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and\nhistories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing\nwhile maintaining acceptable computational overhead."}

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

We present MPQ-DMv2, an improved \\textbf{M}ixed\n\\textbf{P}recision \\textbf{Q}uantization framework for extremely low-bit\n\\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{M}odels. For the quantization perspective, the\nimbalanced distribution caused by salient outliers is quantization-unfriendly\nfor uniform quantizer. We propose \\textit{Flexible Z-Order Residual Mixed\nQuantization} that utilizes an efficient binary residual branch for flexible\nquant steps to handle salient error. For the optimization framework, we\ntheoretically analyzed the convergence and optimality of the LoRA module and\npropose \\textit{Object-Oriented Low-Rank Initialization} to use prior\nquantization error for informative initialization. We then propose\n\\textit{Memory-based Temporal Relation Distillation} to construct an online\ntime-aware pixel queue for long-term denoising temporal information\ndistillation, which ensures the overall temporal consistency between quantized\nand full-precision model.

However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:\nsignificant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and\nlimited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing\nmethods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer\narchitectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,\nCNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,\nand Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their\napplication to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes\nRegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models\n(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of\nCRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional\ncross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear\ncomplexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under\ntexture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)\nstrategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through\nmultiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically\nfuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature\nrepresentations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be\nseamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting\nregistration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a\nmulti-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local\ninformation and enable effective interaction between global and local features.\nExtensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated\nthat RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods."}

While\ncomputational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease\ndetection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and\nbiases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and\nexpert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and\nthe cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial\nnoise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,\ntransformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels\nwith a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from\nEHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the\nscope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning\nembeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence\npatterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level\nrepresentations via a multi-layer transformer architecture.

To address\nthese critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which\ncomprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual\nfeatures for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.\nBuilding on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive\nDynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).\nTDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and\ndestination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node\ngeneration to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.\nTo enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the\nstructural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further\npropose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for\nreproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key\ninsights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in\nDyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for\nadvancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical\napplications in DyTAG generation.

The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize\nplanning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to\nanalyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules\nthat improve future behavior.

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling.

To\novercome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning\nframework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated\nCBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:\n(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has\nachieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a\nnovel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture\ncritical geometric relationships among anatomical structures.

Here we address this issue by\ndeveloping and deploying a new efficient and highly performant SAR vessel\ndetection model, using a customised YOLOv8 architecture specifically optimized\nfor FPGA-based processing within common satellite power constraints (<10W). We\ntrain and evaluate our model on the largest and most diverse open SAR vessel\ndataset, xView3-SAR, and deploy it on a Kria KV260 MPSoC. We show that our\nFPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%\nlower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to\nthree orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet\nhighly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for\nmore autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems."}

These\nfindings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a\npost-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for\nthe distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the\nkey property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce\na conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from\nCoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require\ncomplex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating\nthe experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad\nbehavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose\nits reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to\nstress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion.

Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus\non constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of\nhuman-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label\nnoise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large\ntraining datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes\nto testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as\npossible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce\nOPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a\ndesired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for\nlabelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming\n(MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified\naccuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing\nvision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of\ntest data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on\nseven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL,\nrelying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just\n1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half.\nFurther, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in\nlabelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all\nmethods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated\ntest-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while\nachieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines.

In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed\nAdaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two\nmain issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new\nsynthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples\nacross various materials and configurations, reducing the need for\ntime-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\\varphi$-Adapt, a\nphysics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between\nmodels trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.\nExperimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our\nproposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain\nadaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for\nreal-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and\nmaterials science communities."}

In this perspective, we propose a\nfour-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,\ntraceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs\narising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a\nstructured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,\nspanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,\nsystem prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical\napproaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical\nassets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies\nand governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of\nrethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance\nfor developers, researchers, and regulators alike."}

To provide insights into the decision-making\nprocess of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping\nalgorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of\nthe retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification\noutcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting\nAD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important\nfeatures for AD detection in each imaging modality.

We propose a\nfully self-supervised method which can be trained without any manual\nintervention or artist generated training data allowing the method to be\nintegrated with hair reconstruction methods to enable automatic end-to-end\nmethods for avatar reconstruction. Our approach harnesses the power of compact,\nmemory-efficient neural networks to simulate hair at the strand level, allowing\nfor the simulation of diverse hairstyles without excessive computational\nresources or memory requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough a variety of hairstyle examples, showcasing its potential for\nreal-world applications."}

In\nclinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the\nscreening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist\nis a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this\narea remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality\ninstance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with\nnarrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring\ndetailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression\nin RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis,\nwhich alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating\nexpertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist\nbone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii)\nSharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for\nwrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 621 wrist conventional\nradiographs of 227 patients from four medical centers, with pixel-level\ninstance segmentation annotations for 443 images and SvdH BE scores for 548\nimages. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks\nrelated to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression\nquantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte\ndetection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal\nbone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the\nbarrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within\nthe RA-related domain."}

Yet, the significant\nReal2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of\nphysical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,\na differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.\nIt jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and\nfriction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world\nobservations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a\nconditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by\ntranslating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos\nconditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The\nproposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%\ncompared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by\n89.91\\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic\nenvironment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate\nacross real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms\nto leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances\nvision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting\napproach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement\nlearning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve\nvision-language model responses by establishing preferences for\nnavigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided\nVision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and\nvision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve\nperformance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering\ntasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving\ngeneralization to diverse driving scenarios.
